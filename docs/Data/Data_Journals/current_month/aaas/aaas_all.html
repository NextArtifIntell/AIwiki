  abstract     = {Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent nonequilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a “nonlocal” pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe 2 , several microns away from the illumination spot. We identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons’ linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results will allow exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.},

In this work, we curate a peptide assembly database through a combination of manual processing by human experts and large language model–assisted literature mining. As a result, we collect over 1000 experimental data entries with information about peptide sequence, experimental conditions, and corresponding self-assembly phases. Using the data, machine learning models are developed, demonstrating excellent accuracy (&gt;80%) in assembly phase classification. Moreover, we fine-tune a GPT model for peptide literature mining with the developed dataset, which markedly outperforms the pretrained model in extracting information from academic publications. This workflow can improve efficiency when exploring potential self-assembling peptide candidates, through guiding experimental work, while also deepening our understanding of the governing mechanisms.},

Understanding physical differences between euchromatin and heterochromatin is crucial, yet specific labeling methods in living cells remain limited. Here, we have developed replication-dependent histone (Repli-Histo) labeling to mark nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. Using this approach, we investigated local nucleosome motion in the four known chromatin classes, from euchromatin to heterochromatin, of living human and mouse cells. The more euchromatic (earlier-replicated) and more heterochromatic (later-replicated) regions exhibit greater and lesser nucleosome motions, respectively. Notably, the motion profile in each chromatin class persists throughout interphase. Genome chromatin is essentially replicated from regions with greater nucleosome motions, although the replication timing is perturbed. Our findings, combined with computational modeling, suggest that earlier-replicated regions have more accessibility, and local chromatin motion can be a major determinant of genome-wide replication timing.},

DNMT3B is intricately regulated by histone H3 modifications, yet the dynamic interplay between DNMT3B and histone modifications remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the PWWP (proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline) domain within DNMT3B exhibits remarkable dynamics that enhances the enzyme’s methyltransferase activity upon interactions with a modified histone H3 peptide (H3K4 me0 K36 me3 ). In the presence of H3K4 me0 K36 me3 , both the PWWP and ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L) domains transition from autoinhibitory to active conformations. In this active state, the PWWP domain most often aligns closely with the catalytic domain, allowing for simultaneous interactions with H3 and DNA to stimulate DNA methylation. The prostate cancer–associated DNMT3B R545C mutant is even more dynamic and susceptible to adopting the active conformation, resulting in aberrant DNA hypermethylation. Our study suggests the mechanism by which conformational rearrangements in DNMT3B are triggered by histone modifications, ultimately unleashing its activity in DNA methylation.},

It is present in Africa, Europe, Asia, and in the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. There are no effective treatments or broadly licensed vaccines to prevent disease. Efforts to counteract ASF have been hampered because of the lack of convenient tools to engineer its etiological agent, ASF virus (ASFV), largely due to its large noninfectious genome. Here, we report the use of synthetic genomics methodology to develop a reverse genetics system for ASFV using a CRISPR-Cas9–inhibited self-helper virus to reconstitute live recombinant ASFV from synthetic genomes to rapidly generate a variety of combinatorial mutants of ASFV. The method will substantially facilitate the development of therapeutics or subunit and live-attenuated vaccines for ASF. This synthetic genomics-based approach has wide-ranging impact because it can be applied to rapidly develop reverse genetics tools for emerging viruses with noninfectious genomes.},

OpenCRISPR-1 is a CRISPR system synthesized de novo using large language models (LLMs) but has not yet undergone systematic characterization. Using AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq, we assessed the on-target activity and off-target profiles of these systems across multiple genomic loci. FrCas9 demonstrated higher on-target efficiency and substantially fewer off-target effects than SpCas9 and OpenCRISPR-1. Furthermore, TREX2 fusion with FrCas9 reduced large deletions and translocations, enhancing genomic stability. Through screening of 1903 sgRNAs targeting 21 CGT-relevant genes using sequential AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq analysis, we identified optimal sgRNAs for each gene. Our high-throughput screening platform highlights FrCas9, particularly in its TREX2-fused form, as a highly specific and efficient tool for precise therapeutic genome editing.},

We investigated associations between steroid levels and biological sex, age, clinical and demographic data, genetics, and plasma proteomics. Steroid hormone levels were strongly affected by sex and age, and a high number of lifestyle habits. Key observations were the broad impact of hormonal birth control in female donors and the relationship with smoking in male donors. In a 10-year follow-up study, we identified significant associations between steroid hormone levels and health status only in male donors.

Here, we demonstrate quantum storage of photonic qubits for 1.021 milliseconds based on a laser-written optical waveguide fabricated in a 151 Eu 3+ :Y 2 SiO 5 crystal. Spin dephasing of 151 Eu 3+ is mitigated through dynamical decoupling applied via on-chip electric waveguides, and we obtain a storage efficiency of 12.0 ± 0.5% at 1.021 milliseconds, which is a demonstration of integrated quantum memories that outperforms the efficiency of a simple fiber delay line. Such long-lived waveguide-based quantum memory could support applications in quantum repeaters, and further combination with critical magnetic fields could enable potential application as transportable quantum memories.},

This phosphorylation stabilizes Toc33 by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Constitutive triple response 1 (CTR1), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling, and its paralog RAF-like kinase are involved in phosphorylating Toc33. Disruption of Toc33 phosphorylation impairs its stability and photosynthetic protein import, consequently affecting chloroplast structural integrity and biogenesis. Our findings underscore the essential role of TOC phosphorylation in chloroplast biogenesis and reveal an unexpected regulatory network involving RAF-like kinases in organelle development.},

Emerging data from human studies and epidemiological models suggest that increased divergence in contemporary viruses may drive differential cross-protection, where infection with Yamagata lineage viruses provides limited immunity against Victoria lineage viruses. Here, we developed animal models to investigate the mechanisms behind asymmetric cross-protection between contemporary FLUBV lineages. Our results show that contemporary Victoria immunity provides robust cross-protection against the Yamagata lineage, whereas Yamagata immunity offers limited protection against the Victoria lineage. This differential cross-protection is driven by Victoria-elicited neuraminidase (NA)–specific antibodies, which show cross-lineage reactivity, unlike those from Yamagata infections. These findings identify a phenomenon in contemporary FLUBV that may help explain the recent disappearance of the Yamagata lineage from circulation, highlighting the crucial role of targeting NA in vaccination strategies to enhance cross-lineage FLUBV protection.},

Using a combination of atmospheric reanalysis, satellite data, and hydrologic modeling, we overcame key limitations typical of data-scarce, high-variability regions and revealed that despite the catastrophic impact, the return periods of the rainfall and flood were only a few decades. Hydraulic simulations revealed that the dam failures amplified the damage nearly 20-fold compared to a dam-free scenario.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in wearable sweat sensors, which use standardized electrochemical and colorimetric mechanisms, offer holistic representation of health status for users. However, the constraints of standardized sweat sensors present ongoing challenges to realization of personalized health management. This study presents an electrocolorimetric (EC) platform that enables the reversible and multiple-time use of colorimetric data visualization using electrophoretic display (EPD). This platform represents the application of low-power EPD in epidermal sweat sensor, evaluated through CIELAB-based methodology which is the first systematic evaluation tool of wearable display performance. Moreover, our platform has been demonstrated in human exercise trials for its ability to detect the lactate threshold (LT). This digital colorimetric system has the potential to play a pivotal role by integrating various health monitoring biomarkers. While providing real-time, continuous, and adjustable range information with high sensitivity, this platform validates its extensive probability as a next-generation wearable epidermal sensor.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic dysregulation represents one of the major driving forces in aging. Although multiple genetic and pharmacological manipulations are known to extend longevity in model organisms, aging is a complex trait, and targeting one’s own genes may be insufficient to prevent age-dependent deterioration. An alternative strategy could be to use enzymes from other species to reverse age-associated metabolic changes. In this review, we discuss a set of enzymes from lower organisms that have been shown to affect various metabolic parameters linked to age-related processes. These enzymes include modulators of steady-state levels of amino acids (METase, ASNase, and ADI), NADPH/NADP + and/or reduced form of coenzyme Q (CoQH 2 )/CoQ redox potentials (NDI1, AOX, Lb NOX, TPNOX, Ec STH, RquA, LOXCAT, Grubraw, and ScURA), GSH (StGshF), mitochondrial membrane potential (mtON and mito-dR), or reactive oxygen species (DAAO and KillerRed-SOD1). We propose that leveraging non-mammalian enzymes represents an untapped resource that can be used to delay aging and age-related diseases.},

To mitigate such escape, we preemptively enhance AZD3152, an antibody authorized for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, we identify AZD3152 vulnerabilities at antigen positions F456 and D420. Through two iterations of computational antibody design that integrates structure-based modeling, machine-learning, and experimental validation, we co-optimize AZD3152 against 24 contemporary and previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as 20 potential future escape variants. Our top candidate, 3152-1142, restores full potency (100-fold improvement) against the more recently emerged XBB.1.5+F456L variant that escaped AZD3152, maintains potency against previous variants of concern, and shows no additional vulnerability as assessed by DMS. This preemptive mitigation demonstrates a generalizable approach for optimizing existing antibodies against potential future viral escape.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of compressed atomic-type hydrides offers a promising avenue toward achieving room-temperature superconductivity, but it necessitates extremely high pressures to completely dissociate hydrogen molecules to release free electrons. Here, we report a remarkable finding of compressed H 2 -molecular–type hydride CaH 14 exhibiting an unusual transition temperature ( T c ) of 204.0 kelvin. The peculiarity of its electronic structure lies in the pronounced emergence of near-free electrons, which manifest metallic bonding, but molecular hydrogen fragments persist. This finding indicates that the necessary condition for superconducting transition is forming the Fermi sea with Cooper pairs rather than the monatomic hydrogen. Notably, the formation mechanism of free electrons can be effectively explained by the finite-depth potential wells model. Intriguingly, this H 2 -molecular–type hydride can downgrade the required pressure to 80 gigapascal while maintaining a high T c of 84 kelvin, well above the liquid-nitrogen temperature. Our study has established a high-temperature superconducting paradigm and opened the prospect for achieving high- T c superconductors in H 2 -molecular–type hydrides at low pressure.},

In view of clinical translation of dual AAV intein vectors, here we set to evaluate both the efficiency and safety of their subretinal administration in relevant large animal models. Accordingly, we have developed the first pig model of STGD1, which we found to accumulate lipofuscin similarly to patients. This accumulation is significantly reduced upon subretinal administration of dual AAV intein vectors whose safety and pharmacodynamics we then tested in nonhuman primates, which showed modest and reversible inflammation as well as high levels of photoreceptor transduction. This bodes well for further clinical translation of dual AAV intein vectors in patients with STGD1 as well as for other blinding diseases that require the delivery of large genes.},

Alternative pathways (APs) have been designed to relocate the decarboxylation step or even fix additional carbon. To improve the success of transferring those engineered APs from model species to crops, we must understand how they will interact with metabolism and how plant physiology affects their performance. Here, we used multiple mathematical modeling techniques to analyze and compare existing AP designs. We show that carbon-fixing APs are the most promising candidates to replace native photorespiration in major crop species. Our results demonstrate the different metabolic routes that APs use to increase yield and which plant physiology can profit the most from them. We anticipate our results to guide the design of new APs and to help improve existing ones.},

Inspired by Parthenocissus , we propose a growing-climbing mechanism and report a soft climbing robot, which grows microstructured biofilms to enhance adhesion, similar to Parthenocissus growing suckers and adsorbing to the wall. The robot uses shape memory alloy contraction to achieve bending, similar to Parthenocissus using gelatinous fibers contraction to achieve hinge-like bending. In addition, to not damage the site, it can be fully contracted after completing tasks. The climbing robot can climb on various complex surfaces, especially discontinuous surfaces, verifying the effectiveness of Parthenocissus ’ growing-climbing mechanism.

The answer is yes, and trilayer goldene is the magic number, for reasons of electronegativity. Experiments are made to synthesize the atomically laminated phase Ti 4 Au 3 C 3 through substitutional intercalation of Si layers in Ti 4 SiC 3 for Au. Density functional theory calculations suggest that it is energetically favorable to insert three layers of Au into Ti 4 SiC 3 , compared to inserting a monolayer, a bilayer, or more than three layers. Isolated trilayer goldene sheets, ~100 nanometers wide and 6.7 angstroms thick, were obtained by chemically etching the Ti 4 C 3 layers from Ti 4 Au 3 C 3 templates. Furthermore, trilayer goldene is found in both hcp and fcc forms, where the hcp is ~50 milli–electron volts per atom more stable at room temperature from ab initio molecular dynamic simulations.},

This system leverages bacterial tropism to enhance macrophage infiltration and polarization. The low oxygen levels trigger in situ aCD47 expression, blocking the “do not eat me” signal and boosting macrophage antitumor activity.

Cross-[4+2] cycloadditions offer greater product diversity than traditional diene-dienophile reactions due to multiple possible pathways. However, precise control over regio- and stereoselectivity for various isomers remains a great challenge. This study reports catalyst-controlled regiodivergent formal cross-cycloadditions of acyclic dienes and enones, significantly enhancing access to diverse pyrazole-fused spirooxindoles. Chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis enables endoselective [4+2] cycloadditions, while Bi(III) with a CPA ligand yields [2+4] products with high regio- and stereoselectivity. A Claisen rearrangement of the [2+4] adduct produces the exo-selective [4+2] product, further increasing stereochemical diversity and enabling the synthesis of six regio- and stereo-isomers from a single substrate set. DFT calculations reveal that Bi(III) reverses regioselectivity by repositioning reactants in the CPA pocket and stabilizing the enone oxygen’s negative charge. In addition, product 3as demonstrates therapeutic potential against triple-negative breast cancer, with an IC 50 of 8.5 μM in MDA-MB-453 cells.},

Here, we present a scalable nanofabrication technique that combines bottom-up and top-down approaches for selective growth of 3D DNA superlattices on gold microarrays. This approach allows for the fabrication of self-assembled 3D-nanostructured electronic devices. DNA strands are bound onto the gold arrays, which anchor DNA origami frames and promote ordered framework growth on the specific areas of the surface, enabling control of the lateral placement and orientation of superlattices. DNA frameworks selectively grown on the pads are subsequently templated to nanoscale silica and tin oxide (SnO x ) that follow the architecture, as confirmed by structural and chemical characterizations. The fabricated SnO x superlattices are integrated into devices that demonstrate photocurrent response.},

  abstract     = {Pioneer transcription factors (TFs) initiate chromatin remodeling, which is crucial for gene regulation and cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated how the sequential expression of neurogenin 3 (NGN3) and NEUROD1 affects their pioneering functions during pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we mapped NGN3-binding sites, confirming the pivotal role of this molecule in regulating chromatin accessibility. The pioneering function of NGN3 involves dose tolerance, and low doses are sufficient. Although NEUROD1 generally acts as a conventional TF, it can assume a pioneering role in the absence of NGN3. The sequential expression of NeuroD1 and Ngn3 predominantly drives α cell generation, which may explain the inefficient β cell induction observed in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that pioneer activity is dynamically shaped by temporal TF expression and inter-TF interactions, providing insights into transcriptional regulation and its implications for disease mechanisms and therapeutic targeting and enhancing in vitro differentiation strategies.},

Here, we found that Ca 2+ leakage after Mtb phagosome damage in human macrophages is the signal that triggers autophagy-related protein 8/microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (ATG8/LC3) lipidation. Unexpectedly, ATG8/LC3 lipidation did not target Mtb to lysosomes, excluding the canonical xenophagy. Upon Mtb phagosome damage, the Ca 2+ leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation occurred on multiple membranes instead of single or double membranes excluding the noncanonical autophagy pathways. Mechanistically, Ca 2+ leakage from the phagosome triggered the recruitment of the V-ATPase–ATG16L1 complex independently of FIP200, ATG13, and proton gradient disruption. Furthermore, the Ca 2+ leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation limited Mtb phagosome damage and restricted Mtb replication. Together, we uncovered Ca 2+ leakage as the key signal that triggers ATG8/LC3 lipidation on multiple membranes to mitigate Mtb phagosome damage.},

Halofuginone suppressed food intake, increased energy expenditure, and resulted in weight loss in diet-induced obese mice while also alleviating insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Using molecular and pharmacological tools with transcriptomics, we identified that halofuginone increases fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) levels via activating integrated stress response. Using Gdf15 and Fgf21 knockout mice, we show that both hormones are necessary to elicit anti-obesity changes.

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, subhertz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the SNSPD’s straight segments with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current crowding–free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: After irradiation with 800 ions nm −2 , locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37%, while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently. We achieve an internal detection efficiency of 94% with 7 mHz dark count rate near the onset of saturating detection efficiency for a wavelength of 780 nm.},

The bubble contained at the end of a micropipette and the surrounding liquid form a gas-liquid multiphase system susceptible to acoustic waves. Driven by a piezoelectric transducer, the oscillating gas-liquid interface induces acoustic microstreaming, markedly increasing the mass transfer efficiency. It enables multiple liquid micromanipulations, including mixing, dispersion, enhancing cell membrane permeability, and harvesting selected cells. Furthermore, a controllable three-dimensional axisymmetric vortex in an open environment overcomes the constraints of microfluidic chip, enabling stable trapping, rapid transportation, and multidirectional rotation of HeLa cells, embryos, and other bio-objects ranging from micrometers to millimeters. A variety of applications demonstrate that the μSonic-hand, with its wide-range capabilities, inherent biocompatibility, and extremely low cost could remarkably advance biomedical science.},

Using automated microinjection into apical progenitors (APs) of embryonic mouse neocortex and electroporation of APs in chimpanzee cerebral organoids, we show that NBPF14 promotes the delamination of AP progeny, by promoting oblique cleavage plane orientation during AP division, leading to increased abundance of the key basal progenitor type, basal radial glia. In contrast, NOTCH2NLB promotes AP proliferation, leading to expansion of the AP pool. When expressed together, NBPF14 and NOTCH2NLB exert coordinated effects, resulting in expansion of basal progenitors while maintaining self-renewal of APs. Hence, these two human-specific genes orchestrate the behavior of APs, and the lineages of their progeny, in a manner essential for the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex.},

One aspect of this debate is how Hadean zircons fit into an ultramafic environment. On the basis of experiments, thermodynamic modeling, and elemental partitioning, we show that felsic melts could have been generated by shallow interaction between primordial serpentinized peridotite and basaltic magmas on Earth and Mars. On the basis of the hafnium isotopic evolution of Hadean detrital zircons worldwide, we infer that these interactions allowed for the formation of extensive Hadean felsic crust (4.4 to 4.5 billion years ago), which, in turn, would account for up to 50% of the present continental crustal mass. A similar process may have occurred on Mars. The serpentinized protocrust had a dual role in the primitive planetary environment: to provide ingredients for the continental crust and to enable life to emerge on water-bearing terrestrial planets.},

The lamina underwent cycles of wrinkling and smoothing as the nucleus changed from an irregular, rounded shape in the wide channel regions between constrictions to a smooth, hourglass shape as the nucleus passed through the center of a constriction. The laminar surface area of nuclei within constrictions was measured to be at or above the computationally predicted threshold area for the nuclear volume. The channels excluded control nuclei that had insufficient excess surface area, but not nuclei lacking lamin A/C.

Our analysis shows that NAT10-dependent ac 4 C-acetylation is robust in rRNA and specific tRNAs but low/spurious in mRNA. It also revealed an inflammatory signature and mutagenesis at transcriptionally active sites in NAT10-KO cells. This finding led us to explore the role of NAT10 in R-loops, which were recently linked to APOBEC3B-mediated mutagenesis. Our analysis showed that R-loops are ac 4 C-acetylated in a NAT10-dependent manner. Furthermore, NAT10 restrains the levels of R-loops at a subset of differentially expressed genes in a catalytic activity–dependent manner. Together with cellular biology data showing ac 4 C-modified RNA in endosomal structures, we propose that increased levels of ac 4 C-unmodified RNAs, likely derived from R-loops, in endosomal structures induce inflammatory responses.},

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence has shown that epigenetic regulation plays a fundamental role in cancer metastasis, the major cause of cancer-related deaths. Here, we conducted an in vivo screen for vulnerabilities of brain metastasis and identified N -acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) as a driver of brain metastasis. Knockdown of NAT10 restrains cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. The poorly characterized RNA helicase domain of NAT10 is critical for cell growth in vitro, while both RNA helicase and NAT domains are essential for primary tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. Mechanically, NAT10 promotes the expression of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), two enzymes for serine biosynthesis implicated in brain metastasis. Silencing PHGDH or PSAT1 in metastatic breast cancer cells inhibits their growth in the serine/glycine-limited condition, phenocopying the effects of NAT10 depletion. These findings establish NAT10 as a key regulator of brain metastasis and nominate NAT10 as a target for treating metastasis.},

Current diagnostic imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging fail to characterize oxidative stress within atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce difuranfluoreno-dithiophen–based polymers designed for afterglow imaging, offering ultrabright luminescence, ultralow-power excitation (0.087 milliwatts per square centimeter), and ultrashort acquisition times (0.01 seconds). Through a molecular engineering strategy, we have optimized polymers for enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability, ROS capturing capability, and fluorescence quantum yield, resulting in an increase in afterglow intensity (~130-fold) compared to commonly used 2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene polymer (MEHPPV). Additionally, we have developed ratiometric afterglow nanoparticles doped with oxidative stress–responsive molecules, enabling imaging of oxidative stress markers in atherosclerotic plaque. This approach provides a tool for cardiovascular imaging and diagnostics, which is conducive to the auxiliary diagnosis and risk stratification of atherosclerosis.},

Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling and targeted in situ detection to identify Reln (encoding the secreted glycoprotein, Reelin) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal populations within the rat NAc. A CRISPR interference approach enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc altered expression of calcium signaling genes, promoted a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and decreased MSN excitability. Behaviorally, Reln knockdown prevented cocaine locomotor sensitization, abolished cocaine place preference memory, and decreased cocaine self-administration behavior.

HPB are widely present in the global environment, and their distribution follows a latitudinal diversity gradient. Climate and anthropogenic factors are identified as major drivers of the global distribution of HPB. Our predictions indicated that by the end of this century, the richness, abundance, and invasion risk of HPB will increase globally, with this upward trend becoming more pronounced as development sustainability declines.

At templated AP sites, cross-links between the DNA and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine binding, embryonic stem cell–specific (HMCES) regulate replication fork speed, avoiding cytotoxic double-strand breaks. While the role of HMCES at the template DNA strand is well studied, its effects on nascent DNA are not. We provide evidence that HMCES–DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are detrimental to the BER-mediated removal of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine (5hmdC)–derived 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine from replication forks. HRD cells have heightened HMCES-DPCs, which increase further upon 5hmdC exposure, suggesting that HMCES binds both spontaneous and 5hmdC-induced AP sites. HMCES depletion substantially suppresses 5hmdC-mediated replication fork defects, chromosomal aberrations, and cell death in HRD cells. This reveals that HMCES-DPCs are a source of BER-initiated single-stranded DNA gaps, which indicates that endogenous DPCs contribute to genomic instability in HRD tumors.},

Our previous research revealed that M2 macrophages transfected with magnetotactic bacteria–derived Mms6 gene can resist ferroptosis and enhance SCI recovery. To address the limitations of M2 macrophage transplantation, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating Mms6 mRNA targeting macrophages ( Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs). The targeting efficiency and therapeutic effect of these LNPs in SCI mice were evaluated. Intravenous administration of Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs delivered more Mms6 mRNAs to lesion-site macrophages than those in the Mms6 mRNA-LNP group, which resulted in enhancing motor function recovery, reducing lesion area and scar formation, and promoting neuronal survival and nerve fiber repair. These effects were nullified when macrophages were depleted. These findings suggest that macrophage-targeted delivery of Mms6 mRNA is a promising therapeutic strategy for promoting spinal cord repair and motor function recovery in patients with traumatic SCI.},

Previous research has established headcase as a fundamental gene for stress responses and survival of the Drosophila adult progenitor cells (APCs). However, the molecular role of Headcase has remained elusive. Here, we identify Headcase as a component of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. We also show that, Headcase is required for proper RNP granule formation and remodeling upon stress and is crucial for translation control. Likewise, the human Headcase homolog (HECA) is identified as a component of RNP granules and has similar roles in translational regulation and stress protection. Thus, Headcase proteins define a new family contributing to specific roles among the RNP heterogeneous network.},

The pathogenesis of F. oxysporum in plants is controlled by its circadian clock, with infections causing severe disease symptoms at dawn. Notably, disruption of clock genes dramatically reduces fungal pathogenicity. Circadian clocks regulate the rhythmic expression of several transcription factors, including FoZafA, which enables the pathogen to adapt to zinc starvation within the plant, and FoCzf1, which governs the production of the toxin fusaric acid. Together, our findings highlight the critical roles of circadian clocks in F. oxysporum pathogenicity by regulating zinc starvation response and secondary metabolite production.},

Here, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize neuromodulatory signals in the premotor cortex (medial M2) as mice engage in a competitive matching pennies game. Spatially, NE signals are more segregated with choice and outcome encoded at distinct locations, whereas ACh signals can multiplex and reflect different behavioral correlates at the same site.

Here, we generate a mutant mouse line with human W88C mutation (W88C Mut mice), which exhibits behavioral deficits similar to those observed in patients with TS, including repetitive motor behaviors and sensorimotor gating abnormalities. The W88C mutation leads to the degradation of kidney and brain (KIBRA) protein via a proteasomal pathway, evokes dopamine release in the dorsal striatum, and disrupts synaptic function through the dysregulation of Hippo pathway. Neuron-specific overexpression of wild-type WWC1 rescues synaptic and behavioral phenotypes in W88C Mut mice.

  abstract     = {Fossil assemblages exhibit a global depletion in taxonomic distinctiveness in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction (~252 million years ago), but little is known about why. Here, we examine whether biotic homogenization can be explained by tropical survivors tracking an expansion of their preferred habitat, measured in terms of the ratio of environmental oxygen supply to metabolic demand. We compare spatial similarity in community composition among marine invertebrate fossils represented by bivalve and gastropod fossils with predictions from an ecophysiological model of habitat that diagnoses areas in the ocean that can sustain the aerobic requirements of marine invertebrates. Modeled biogeographic responses to climate change yield an increase in global similarity of community composition among surviving ecophysiotypes, consistent with patterns in the fossil record and arguing for a physiological control on earliest Triassic biogeography.},

To enable x-ray–excited photodynamic therapy (XPDT) that targets deep-seated tumors, we synthesized a nanoscintillator-photosensitizer complex containing 5% Eu-doped Y 2 O 3 fluorescing at 611 nanometers and decorated with SiO 2 containing the scintillation-coupled photosensitizer methylene blue and a polyethylene glycol coating [PEGylated Y 2 O 3 :Eu@SiO 2 -methylene blue (pYSM)]. When irradiated, pYSMs generate singlet oxygen species in vitro, causing cytotoxicity with hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (calreticulin translocation to the cell membrane). Intravenously administered pYSMs home passively to pancreatic tumor xenografts and, upon 10 gray irradiation, cause significant tumor regression ( P &lt; 0.01). On combining XPDT with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, a distant nonirradiated tumor also regresses via an increase in intratumoral activated CD8 + cytotoxic T cells. Collectively, we advance a systemically delivered XPDT strategy that mediates an antitumor effect in both irradiated and nonirradiated (abscopal) tumors when coupled with immunotherapy, converting an immunologically “cold” tumor to an immunologically “hot” tumor.},

Some exploit background motion to hide while hunting, and others may use coloration and behavior to generate motion noise that impairs detection or recognition. Here, we uncover a unique form of motion camouflage, showing that broadclub cuttlefish pass dark stripes downward across their head and arms to disguise their hunting maneuvers. This “passing-stripe” display reduces the probability of response to predatory expanding stimuli by prey crabs in a lab-based experiment, is modulated according to approach speed during a hunt, and generates a motion pattern that is different from that of looming predators. This form of motion camouflage likely functions by overwhelming the threatening motion of the approaching predator with nonthreatening downward motion generated by the rhythmic stripes.},

The gold standard, 2-[ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, is limited by radioactive exposure and sparse assessment of metabolism beyond glucose uptake and retention. Deuterium magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) with [6,6- 2 H 2 ]glucose is nonradioactive, achieves tumor metabolic contrast, but can be improved by enriched contrast from deuterated water (HDO) based imaging. Here, we developed a DMRI protocol employing [ 2 H 7 ]glucose. Imaging 2 H-signal and measuring HDO production in tumor-bearing mice detected differential glucose utilization across baseline tumors, tumors treated with vehicle control or anti-glycolytic BRAFi and MEKi therapy, and contralateral healthy tissue. Control tumors generated the most 2 H-signal and HDO. To our knowledge this is the first application of DMRI with [ 2 H 7 ]glucose for tumoral treatment monitoring. This approach demonstrates HDO as a marker of tumor glucose utilization and suggests translational capability in humans due to its safety, noninvasiveness, and suitability for serial monitoring.},

Here, we report a unified PUF and TRNG chip based on a 28-nanometer embedded memristor with concealable ability. We use the memristor intrinsic FORMING condition variation and read current variation as entropy sources and design a compact on-chip entropy extractor that achieves a high throughput of 41.7 megabits per second with minimal area overhead of 0.291 MF 2 . To prevent PUF data leakage, we developed a concealment method, protecting data when idle and enabling recovery upon demand. Comprehensive testing shows the chip has excellent performance in randomness, reliability, lifetime, and stability, achieving a 3.82-fold throughput improvement over complementary metal-oxide semiconductor–based designs in authentication tasks.},

We explore peptide nucleic acid (PNA) as a candidate for a genetic-like polymer in a hypothetical sulfuric acid biochemistry. PNA hexamers undergo between 0.4 and 28.6% degradation in 98% (w/w) sulfuric acid at ~25°C, over the span of 14 days, depending on the sequence, but undergo complete solvolysis above 80°C.

A subset of these cancers, which we term as “RBness,” lack RB1 genomic defects and yet phenocopy the transcriptional profile of RB1 -defective cancers. We report RBness as a pan-cancer phenomenon, associated with patient outcome and chemotherapy response in multiple cancer types, and predictive of CDK4/6 inhibitor response in estrogen-positive breast cancer. Using RNA interference and a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in isogenic models, we find that RBness cancers also phenocopy synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cells with RB1 genomic defects. In summary, our findings suggest that dysregulation of the RB pathway in cancers lacking RB1 genomic defects provides a molecular rationale for how these cancers could be treated.},

In this study, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models in chest x-ray diagnosis across five globally sourced datasets. Our findings reveal that compared to board-certified radiologists, these foundation models consistently underdiagnose marginalized groups, with even higher rates seen in intersectional subgroups such as Black female patients. Such biases present over a wide range of pathologies and demographic attributes. Further analysis of the model embedding uncovers its substantial encoding of demographic information. Deploying medical AI systems with biases can intensify preexisting care disparities, posing potential challenges to equitable healthcare access and raising ethical questions about their clinical applications.},

Model simulations show that the combined impact of mobile bottom-contact fishing (e.g., trawling) and dredging reduces natural alkalinity generation by 60 to 220 gigaequivalent year −1 , which is equivalent to a reduction of the natural marine carbon sink by 2 to 8 teragrams CO 2 year −1 . Alkalinity destruction by anthropogenic seafloor disturbance hence generates a hidden CO 2 emission, of which the impact is comparable to the estimated reduction of organic carbon burial by mobile bottom-contact fishing. Our analysis emphasizes that carbon accounting in marine systems should consider the anthropogenic impact on both the organic and inorganic carbon cycles.},

AS3MT d2d3 -Tg mice exhibited enlarged ventricles and deficits in sensorimotor gating and sociability. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses of AS3MT d2d3 -Tg brains revealed cell fate imbalances and altered excitatory neuron composition. AS3MT d2d3 localized to centrosome, disrupting mitotic spindle orientation and differentiation in developing neocortex and organoids, in part through NPM1 (Nucleophosmin 1). The structural analysis identified that hydrophobic residues exposed in AS3MT d2d3 are critical for its pathogenic function.

Here, we show that Ephexin5 activates both RhoA and Cdc42 in the brain. Furthermore, using live imaging of GTPase biosensors, we demonstrate that Ephexin5 regulates activity-dependent Cdc42, but not RhoA, signaling at single synapses. The selectivity of Ephexin5 for Cdc42 activation is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is regulated by neuronal activity. Last, in contrast to Ephexin5’s role in negatively regulating synapse density, we show that, downstream of neuronal activity, Ephexin5 positively regulates synaptic growth and stabilization. Our results support a model in which plasticity-inducing neuronal activity regulates Ephexin5 tyrosine phosphorylation, driving Ephexin5-mediated activation of Cdc42 and the spine structural growth and stabilization vital for learning.},

When salt water overlays permafrost, Rayleigh-Darcy (R-D) instability emerges because of the density mismatch and regulates melting (thawing) dynamics. Contrary to expectations that a higher Rayleigh number ( R ) would amplify instability, our experiments revealed fingering and stable melting fronts at low and high R , respectively. We attribute the occurrence of the two melting patterns to the interplay between two competing flow structures: local circumfluence modulated by front perturbation and transversal chaotic mixing. We propose theories that rationalize the melting pattern transition and finger-scale evolution. In addition, the classic mass transport theory for R-D convection drastically underestimates the melting rate and misses key variable(s). The presence of fingering patterns and accelerated dynamics may have led to earlier penetration of the permafrost layer than previously anticipated. These findings have implications for understanding similar processes in magma migration, carbon sequestration, and subsurface energy recovery.},

On Jupiter, the presence of water has been invoked to control the occurrence of large-scale storms; however, the impact of storms on the ammonia and temperature distribution is unknown. We use Juno Microwave Radiometer observations of a large-scale storm in 2017 to study the aftermath of such a storm on the atmosphere. Anomalies in the retrieved ammonia abundance and atmospheric temperature show how storms deplete and heat the upper atmosphere while simultaneously depositing material well below the layers they were triggered at. These observations, aided by simulations, show that the water and ammonia cycles are coupled and that their combined effect plays a key role in explaining the depletion of ammonia in the tropospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.},

  abstract     = {Relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (rrAML) is a malignant blood cancer with an extremely poor prognosis, largely ascribed to the drug-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Most patients suffer from a risk of difficult-to-cure as well as severe systemic toxicity when receiving standard chemotherapies. As hyaluronic acid (HA) is a specific ligand of CD44 highly expressed by LSCs, we had HA self-assembled with cisplatin and daunorubicin to form a dual chemodrug nanogel (HA/Cis/Dau) to afford the targeted therapeutic interventions of rrAML. HA/Cis/Dau displayed an extra therapeutic function of inducing the granulocyte-monocyte differentiation in CD44 + rrAML cells, an rrAML mouse model, and primary blasts isolated from patients with AML. Unlike free drugs directly diffusing and killing rrAML cells, HA/Cis/Dau transported the drugs into lysosomes, causing lysosomal membrane permeabilization, ROS accumulation, and thus a metabolic reprogramming of the rrAML cells. Moreover, HA/Cis/Dau was featured with alleviated side effects, ease of preparation, and cost effectiveness, therefore holding great promises for the targeted treatment of rrAML.},

Here, we present self-organized three-dimensional human gastruloids (hGs) derived from embryonic stem cells. The transcriptome profile of day 3 hGs aligned with Carnegie stage 7 human gastrula, with cell types and differentiation trajectories consistent with human gastrulation. Notably, we observed the emergence of nascent primordial germ cell–like cells (PGCLCs), but without exogenous bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is essential for the PGCLC fate. A mutation in the ISL1 gene affects amnion-like cells and leads to a loss of PGCLCs; the addition of exogenous BMP2 rescues the PGCLC fate, indicating that the amnion may provide endogenous BMP signaling. Our model of early human embryogenesis will enable further exploration of the germ line and other early human lineages.},

In contrast, we demonstrate here the use of thermalization in the generation, control, and readout of “shell-like” spin textures with interacting 13 C nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The textures span several nanometers and encompass many hundred spins; they are created and interrogated without manipulating the nuclear spins individually. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-engineered Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field: The texture is therefore metastable and robust against spin diffusion. This enables the state to endure over multiple minutes before it decays. Our work on spin-state engineering paves the way for applications in quantum simulation and nanoscale imaging.},

The key to the success of the asymmetric reaction was the combination of an achiral monophosphine ligand Ph 2 P(2-furyl) with a chiral diamine derivative, which enhanced the enantioselectivity and reactivity. Density functional theory calculations revealed the hydrogen bond interactions between the chiral diamine derivative, the achiral monophosphine ligand, and the base anion, which combined to induce the desired enantioselectivity.

Driven by electric current, this methodology provides a sustainable route to access enantioenriched dicarbonyls via vinylogous radical pathways. It demonstrates excellent functional groups tolerance, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate compatibility, formation of quaternary stereocenters at remote positions, and high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). Mechanistic investigations indicate that ferrocene-based electron transfer mediators are pivotal in the anodic oxidation process, facilitating the generation of nickel-bound α-carbonyl radicals while suppressing the undesired oxidation of silyl polyenolates, thus guiding the selection of mediators for electrocatalytic systems. The versatility of catalytic asymmetric electrosynthesis is highlighted by the preparation of valuable enantioenriched building blocks and the total synthesis of (-)-ethosuximide.},

The 1.7-gram lightweight microscope integrates confocal fluorescence and photoacoustic microscopy, allowing recordings at 0.78 hertz with 1.5-micrometer lateral resolution across a field of view of 400 micrometers by 400 micrometers. We identified cell type–specific neurovascular responses to hypoxic challenges, observed active regulation of arterioles during sensory stimuli, and detected abnormal oxygen depletion and vasodilation preceding burst neuronal discharges in epileptic disorders.

NCBP1 is composed of 11 amino acid residues with cationic surface potential and favorable safety and stability. Mechanistic studies revealed that NCBP1 displayed antibacterial activity by targeting phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in bacterial membrane, resulting in membrane damage and dysfunction. Notably, NCBP1 showed promising efficacy in mice. Furthermore, NCBP1 effectively inhibited the growth of plant fungal pathogens and enhanced disease resistance in maize.

Herein, an efficient purely organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) material, 3,2-PIC-TXT, with fast phosphorescence radiation is developed. It not only exhibits impressive EL performances as an emitter with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 33.2%, higher than that of Ir(ppy) 3 (25.2%), but also functions remarkably as a sensitizer for green MR-TADF emitters (BN2, tCzphB-Ph, and tCzphB-Fl).

  abstract     = {A widespread decline in dissolved oxygen (DO) has been observed in rivers, temperate lakes, and oceans, yet the impacts of climatic warming on global lake deoxygenation remain unclear. Here, we train data-driven models using climatic data, satellite images, and geographic factors to reconstruct surface DO and quantify the climatic contribution to DO variations in 15,535 lakes from 2003 to 2023. Our analysis indicates a continuous deoxygenation in 83% of the studied lakes. The mean deoxygenation rate in global lakes (−0.049 milligrams per liter per decade) is faster than that observed in the oceans and in rivers. By decreasing solubility, climatic warming contributes 55% of global lake deoxygenation. Meanwhile, heatwaves exert rapid influences on DO decline, resulting in a 7.7% deoxygenation compared to that observed under climatological mean temperatures. By the end of the century, global lake DO is projected to decrease by 0.41 milligrams per liter (4.3%) under SSP2-4.5 and 0.86 milligrams per liter (8.8%) under SSP5-8.5 scenarios.},

We introduce a flat cone dielectric elastomer actuator (FCDEA) array that is thin, soft, and capable of producing spatiotemporally adjustable and large static-to-dynamic force in response to electric voltage signals on large areas of the skin. Integration of the FCDEA array into a photomicrosensor array enables the implementation of a wearable wireless communication haptic patch. We demonstrate that the developed haptic patch allows users to communicate tactile information in real time while maintaining conformal contact with the skin. The haptic patch can also express the topology of 3D structures and render textures of virtual objects in response to localized vibration of the FCDEA array. We expect that the developed haptic patch will provide an immersive touching experience in virtual reality and facilitate tactile communication between users in various applications.},

They superimpose waves with a mutual phase delay, modifying light intensity. A frequency-dependent phase delay enables spectral shaping for filtering, routing, wave shaping, or multiplexing. Conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometers generate sinusoidal output intensities, limiting spectral engineering capabilities. Here, we propose a framework that uses interference of multiple transverse modes within a single multimode waveguide to achieve arbitrary spectral shapes in a compact geometry. Designed corrugated gratings couple these modes, enabling energy exchange akin to a beam splitter for easy multimode handling. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate spectra with independently tunable linewidth and free spectral range, along with distinct spectral shapes for various transverse modes. Our method applies to orthogonal modes of different orders, polarization, and angular momentum, offering potential for sensing, calibration, metrology, and computing.},

Here, we propose a lensless imaging method with programmable Fresnel zone aperture (FZA), termed LIP. With a commercial liquid crystal display, we designed an integrated LIP module and demonstrated its capability of high-quality artifact-free reconstruction through dynamic modulation and offset-FZA parallel merging. Compared to static-modulation approaches, LIP achieves a 2.5× resolution enhancement and a 3 decibels improvement in signal-to-noise ratio in “static mode” while maintaining an interaction frame rate of 15 frames per second in “dynamic mode.” Experimental results demonstrate LIP’s potential as a miniaturized platform for versatile advanced imaging tasks like virtual reality and human-computer interaction.},

While direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective, timely and accurate HCV diagnosis remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. The current two-step HCV testing process is costly and time-intensive, often leading to patient loss before treatment. Point-of-care (POC) HCV antigen (Ag) testing offers a promising alternative, but no FDA-approved test meets the required sensitivity and specificity. To address this, we developed a fully automated, smartphone-based POC HCV Ag assay using platinum nanoparticles, deep learning image processing, and microfluidics.

The synthesis of monazite, LaPO 4 , requires inconveniently high temperatures near 1000°C and generally involves the conversion of the presynthesized rhabdophane, LaPO 4 •nH 2 O, to the LaPO 4 monazite phase. During this structure transformation, the rhabdophane converts irreversibly to the thermodynamically stable monoclinic monazite structure. A low-temperature (185° to 260°C) mild hydrothermal acid-promoted synthesis of monazite is described that can both transform presynthesized rhabdophane or assemble reagents to the monoclinic monazite structure. The pH dependence of this reaction is detailed, and its applicability to the Ln PO 4 ( Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm-Gd), Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 , and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 systems is discussed. The crystal growth of Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 is described, and their crystal structures were reported.

Here, we propose an innovative concept of selective antibacterial starvation therapy based on interfering with proton and electron transfer on the bacterial membrane. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, a special Schottky heterojunction film composed of gold and alkaline magnesium-iron mixed metal oxides (Au/MgFe-MMO) was constructed on the titanium implant. Once bacteria contacted this implant, the Au/MgFe-MMO film continuously captured the proton and electron participated in respiratory chain of bacteria to impede their energy metabolism, leading to the deficit of adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Prolonged exposure to this starvation state inhibited numerous biosynthesis processes and triggered severe oxidative stress in bacteria, ultimately leading to their death due to DNA and membrane damage. In addition, this heterojunction film was comfortable for mammalian cells, without inhibiting mitochondrial function. This proposed starvation antibacterial therapy gives a notable perspective in designing biosafe smart antibacterial biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (T regs ) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes T regs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD + with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing T regs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral T regs , sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD + axis disrupts T regs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.},

Here, we identified an SlKD1-interacting transcription factor GATA transcription factor 6 (SlGATA6), which is required for maintaining the auxin-response gradient and preventing abscission. SlGATA6 up-regulates the expression of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 . The AUXIN RESISTANT/LIKE AUXIN RESISTANT (AUX/LAX) proteins SlLAX2-dependent asymmetric auxin distribution causes differential accumulation of Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid 3 (SlIAA3) and its homolog SlIAA32 across different abscission zone cells. It is also required for SUMOylation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2a (SlARF2a), a key suppressor of auxin signaling and abscission initiator. Moreover, SlIAA3 and SlIAA32 depress SUMOylated SlARF2a, thus suppressing SlARF2a function. The interaction between SlKD1 and SlGATA6 suppresses SlGATA6 binding to the promoters of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 , thereby disrupting the auxin-response gradient and triggering abscission. This regulatory mechanism is conserved under low light–induced abscission in diverse Solanaceae plants.

Consequently, specific induction of sensory innervation to mediate immunoregulation becomes a promising therapeutic approach. Herein, we developed a cell/drug-free strategy to selectively boost endogenous sensory innervation to harness immune responses for promoting tissue rehabilitation. Specifically, a dual-functional phage was constructed with a sensory nerve–homing peptide and a β-subunit of nerve growth factor (β-NGF)–binding peptide. These double-displayed phages captured endogenic β-NGF and localized to sensory nerves to promote sensory innervation. Furthermore, regarding bone regeneration, phage-loaded hydrogels achieved rapid sensory nerve ingrowth in bone defect areas. Mechanistically, sensory neurotization facilitated M2 polarization of macrophages through the Sema3A/XIAP/PAX6 pathway, thus decreasing the M1/M2 ratio to induce the dissipation of local inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight the essential role of sensory innervation in manipulating inflammation and provide a conceptual framework based on neuroimmune interactions for promoting tissue regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Lipid metabolism and the serine, one-carbon, glycine (SOG) and methionine pathways are independently and significantly correlated with estrogen receptor–negative breast cancer (ERneg BC). Here, we propose a link between lipid metabolism and ERneg BC through phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo serine pathway. We demonstrate that the metabolism of the paradigmatic medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid leads to a metabolic shift toward the SOG and methionine pathways. PHGDH plays a role in both the forward direction, contributing to the production of S-adenosylmethionine, and the reverse direction, generating the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to epigenomic reprogramming and phenotypic plasticity. The methionine cycle is closely linked to the transsulfuration pathway. Consequently, we observe that the shift increases the antioxidant glutathione, which mitigates reactive oxygen species (ROS), enabling survival of a subset of cells that have undergone DNA damage. These metabolic changes contribute to several hallmarks of cancer.},

Here, we defined the transcriptional regulators and epigenetic circuitry of Galectin-9 in pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), as an example of a disease with strong Galectin-9 expression, in which higher expression was associated with lower overall survival. By performing a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified the transcription factors IRF1 and TFAP4 as key regulators for Galectin-9 expression by binding its regulatory elements. Whereas IRF1 was observed exclusively on the promoter, TFAP4 binding was detected at an enhancer solely in T-ALL cells associated with higher Galectin-9 levels. Together, our results show that IRF1 is responsible and indispensable for Galectin-9 expression and TFAP4 further fine-tunes its expression. Our approach, a flow-based genome-wide CRISPR screen complemented by transcription factor binding and enhancer mapping, creates innovative opportunities for understanding and manipulating epigenetic transcriptional regulation in cancer.},

Our imaging and histopathological studies demonstrated that paramagnetic susceptibility is a sensitive biomarker for iron quantification in epilepsy. This method effectively detects iron abnormality from various causes and highlights that iron alters within epileptogenic zones, indicating the presence of potentially salvageable tissue. Furthermore, iron accumulation was observed to disrupt cortical laminar structures in epileptogenic zones and was associated with the proliferation of central nervous system cells, particularly astrocytes.

Unlike traditional sensors, our electrosense transistor perceives bipolar electric fields with high sensitivity and stability. We use compact models and device simulations to elucidate the mechanisms of charge induction and transport within organic electrosense transistors when exposed to spatial electric fields. Demonstrating its practical utility, we show that robots equipped with our electrosense transistor can successfully navigate and detect concealed objects without requiring direct contact.

Here, in situ high-temperature characterizations on the molten salt electrorefining process are applied to establish an anodic dissolution principle for quantitatively evaluating nonuniform geometric effects of electrode. For eliminating the nonuniform geometric effects, coaxial anode-cathode configurations are designed to promote the nonuniform anodic dissolution and nonuniform cathodic deposition. Consequently, the geometric uniformity of titanium products on the cathodes is substantially enhanced, and thus, long-term stable electrorefining process (~12 hours, ~330% increment compared to the electrode of reference configuration) and highly purified titanium products (99.2%) are achieved.},

This study explores low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) as a resuscitation strategy. Cervical LIPUS stimulation effectively elevated blood pressure in shocked rats. It also improved cerebral and multiorgan perfusion. Mechanistically, LIPUS activated pathways related to sympathetic nerve excitation and vascular smooth muscle contraction, increasing plasma catecholamines and stimulating blood pressure–regulating neural nuclei. Partial sympathetic nerve transection reduced LIPUS efficacy, while complete inhibition of these nuclei abolished the response. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated LIPUS’s ability to raise blood pressure in shock patients. The findings suggest that LIPUS enhances sympathetic nerve activity and activates blood pressure–regulating nuclei, offering a noninvasive, neuromodulation-based approach to shock treatment. This method holds potential for improving blood pressure and organ perfusion in shock patients, especially in resource-limited environments.},

Here, we have established an in vivo time-resolved imaging platform to continuously visualize cellulose biosynthesis and fibril network assembly on Arabidopsis thaliana protoplast surfaces as the primary cell wall regenerates. Our observations provide the basis for a model of cellulose fibril network development in protoplasts driven by an interplay of multiscale dynamics that includes rapid diffusion and coalescence of nascent cellulose fibrils, processive elongation of single fibrils, and cellulose fibrillar network rearrangement during maturation.

The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 in Plasmodium berghei (PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption of pbsip2 resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN 4–6 GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites.},

Theoretical studies suggest that, under strong external forcing, the shape of the synchronization regions can change substantially and even holes can appear in the solid patterns. However, experimentally accessing these abnormal regimes is quite challenging mainly because many real-world systems displaying synchronization become fragile under strong forcing. Here, we are able to observe these intriguing regimes in a breathing-soliton laser. Two types of abnormal synchronization regions are unveiled, namely, a leaf- and a ray-like shape. High-resolution control of the loss allows holes to be revealed in the synchronization regions.

Thumpd1 knockout mice exhibit growth defects and sterility. Concurrent knockout of Thumpd1 and the stress-sensing kinase Gcn2 causes penetrant postnatal lethality in mice, indicating a critical genetic interaction.

  abstract     = {Ultrashort optical emission, with pulse duration ranging from nanoseconds to femtoseconds, is usually obtained from lasers. In this work, we achieve nanosecond-pulsed electroluminescence (EL) from a solution-processed fast-response quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED). By modeling the QLED with a resistor-capacitor equivalent circuit and analyzing the transient current of the circuit, the dynamic of the carrier injection and transport process that fundamentally affects the transient EL of QLED is revealed, which helps to guide the optimization of fast-response QLED. Driven by a high current source, the optimized QLED can output stable and repeatable ultrashort EL with a pulse duration of 20 nanoseconds, a repetition rate of 50 kilohertz, and a high radiant exitance of 5.4 watts per square centimeter. Enabled by the nanosecond-pulsed EL, the developed QLED can be directly used as an instantaneous excitation source for time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Meanwhile, its use as an exposure flash for high-speed imaging is also demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {High-throughput production of monodisperse microdroplets has revolutionized many fields, typically relying on shear-induced emulsification in intricate microfluidic channels to induce the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. This mechanism exhibits low robustness due to its high dependence on the physical properties and flow conditions of fluids. Here, we report a robust emulsification mechanism—wetting-induced interfacial instability—for droplet emission. We find that, when pendant microdroplets in the air contact with an immiscible wetting bulk phase, it triggers interfacial instability in the hanging droplets and then their rapid breakup into the bulk phase. This simplifies the monodisperse microdroplet production using a nozzle positioned above an air-liquid interface, requiring no complex microchannels. We demonstrate that this method exhibits highly scalable production and exceptional robustness against variations in physical properties and flow conditions of fluids, including highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid (56,600 millipascal-seconds). This mechanism provides a simpler alternative to the traditional Rayleigh-Plateau instability for emulsification, offering opportunities for industrial applications and insights into microscale interfacial science.},

Currently, l -Phe is obtained via biosynthetic methods including microbial and enzymatic processes, but their tightly complex feedback regulation and lengthy reaction steps lead to a low practical yield of l -Phe. Here, we have designed a hierarchical Si-based photocathode for l -Phe synthesis by photoelectrochemical coupling of waste CO 2 and nitrophenyl ethane, achieving a high yield rate of 37.5 μg·hour −1 ·cm −2 and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 21.2% at low applied potential under 1 sun illumination. The hierarchical structure with CuO-TiO 2 -C mixtures dispersed in amorphous TiO 2 layer/n + p-Si creates an internal built-in electric field and forms plentiful conducting channels to efficiently realize the injection of electrons into Cu and Ti sites. These Cu and Ti sites adsorb and activate the CO 2 and nitrophenyl ethane, respectively, cooperatively facilitating the l -Phe synthesis. This work introduces an environmentally friendly and highly efficient approach for converting solar energy into valuable amino acid products.},

Here, we identified a kidney disease gene called pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF) through integrating GWAS on kidney function and multiomic analysis. PPDPF was predominantly expressed in healthy proximal tubules of human and mouse kidneys via single-cell analysis. Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD + levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD + and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries. Consequently, knockout of PPDPF notably accelerated the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mouse models induced by aging, chemical exposure, and obstruction. These findings strongly support targeting PPDPF as a potential therapy for kidney fibrosis, offering possibilities for future CKD interventions.},

  abstract     = {The amplified wintertime Arctic warming has accelerated in recent decades. However, whether and how the warming can cause Eurasian cooling remains debated. By identifying daily Arctic warming events, we find direct observational evidence that the Arctic warming tends to cause substantial Eurasian cooling and an increase in occurrence frequency of Eurasian cooling events with a roughly 2-day lag. We propose a mechanism explaining the causality. We find that the Arctic warming causes a large suppression in activities of daily weather disturbances (referred to as synoptic eddies) over high-latitude Eurasia. This produces a meridional dipole in geopotential height anomalies characterized by an equivalent-barotropic anomalous low (high) and a lower-level cooling (warming) over mid-latitude Eurasia (the Arctic) via a nonlinear eddy–to–mean flow feedback. The feedback induces near-surface northeasterly anomalies that enlarge the Eurasian cooling via cold advection. Thus, we conclude that the warm Arctic versus cold Eurasia is essentially an intrinsic dipole determined by synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction.},

In this study, we demonstrate a donor-to-acceptor short-range energy transfer (SRET) mechanism in OPV blends with non-fullerene acceptors, extending beyond the Förster approximation. This SRET occurs as a two-step process mediated by interfacial excitations with mixed charge-transfer and local excitation features. We further validate this model through studies on planar heterojunctions, precisely controlling the thickness of interlayers. These findings underscore the short-range interactions in regulating the donor-to-acceptor energy transfer in OPV blends, suggesting that SRET should be considered alongside FRET and charge-transfer processes for device optimizations.},

Spd-2/CEP192 proteins, defined by a conserved “Spd-2 domain” (SP2D) comprising two closely spaced AspM-Spd-2-Hydin (ASH) domains, play a critical role in centrosome assembly. Here, we show that the SP2D does not target Drosophila Spd-2 to centrosomes but rather promotes PCM scaffold assembly. Crystal structures of the human and honeybee SP2D reveal an unusual “extended cradle” structure mediated by a conserved interaction interface between the two ASH domains. Mutations predicted to perturb this interface, including a human mutation associated with male infertility and Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy, disrupt PCM scaffold assembly in flies. The SP2D is monomeric in solution, but the Drosophila SP2D can form higher-order oligomers upon phosphorylation by PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1). Crystal-packing interactions and AlphaFold predictions suggest how SP2Ds might self-assemble, and mutations associated with one such potential dimerization interface markedly perturb SP2D oligomerization in vitro and PCM scaffold assembly in vivo.},

To examine this, we use rain and aerosol Hg speciation data and high-resolution surface DMHg measurements, collected on a transect from Alaskan coastal waters to the Bering and Chukchi Seas. We observed a significant fivefold increase in the MeHg:THg fraction in rain and a 10-fold increase for aerosols, closely linked to elevated surface DMHg and the highest DMHg evasion (~9.4 picomoles per square meter per hour) found in upwelling waters near the Aleutian Islands. These data highlight a previously underexplored aspect of MeHg air-sea exchange and its importance to Hg cycling and human health concerns. Our findings emphasize the importance of DMHg evasion by demonstrating that atmospheric MeHg can be transported long distances (~1700 kilometers) in the Arctic, posing risks to human health and ecosystems.},

However, the in vivo metabolic pathways of NMN and NR remain to be elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the fate of orally and intravenously administered NMN and NR in mice using NAD + metabolomics. We found that only a small portion of orally administered NMN and NR was directly absorbed from the small intestine and that most of them underwent gut microbiota–mediated deamidation and conversion to nicotinic acid (NA). Moreover, intravenously administered NMN and NR were rapidly degraded into nicotinamide and secreted to bile followed by deamidation to NA by gut microbiota. Thus, enterohepatic circulated NA is preferentially used in the liver. These findings showed that NMN and NR are indirectly converted to NAD + via unexpected metabolic pathways.},

By combining RNA sequencing of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and newly synthesized transcript fractions with biophysical modeling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that transcriptional changes caused by TIP60 depletion are offset by corresponding changes in RNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability, indicating gene-specific buffering. Disruption of the unrelated ATAC coactivator complex also causes gene-specific transcript buffering.

After use in affinity selection, treatment with dithiothreitol enables near-quantitative reduction, rendering linear peptide analogs for standard tandem mass spectrometry. We use these libraries to discover macrocyclic binders to cadherin-2 and anti-hemagglutinin antibody clone 12ca5. Structure-activity relationship studies of an initial cadherin-binding peptide [ CBP ; apparent dissociation constant ( K d ) = 53 nanomolar] reveal residues responsible for driving affinity (hotspots) and mutation-tolerant residues (coldspots). Two original macrocyclic libraries are prepared in which these hotspots and coldspots are derivatized with nonnatural amino acids. Following discovery and validation, high-affinity ligands are discovered from the coldspot library, with NCBP-4 demonstrating improved affinity ( K d = 29 nanomolar).

  abstract     = {Earth’s deep ocean holds a vast reservoir of dissolved organic carbon, traditionally considered old and resistant to microbial degradation. Radiocarbon analyses indicate the hidden occurrence of younger dissolved organic carbon components, assumed to be accessible to deep-sea microorganisms but not yet demonstrated. Using compound-class radiocarbon analysis, molecular characterization, and bioassay experiments, we provide direct evidence for rapid microbial utilization of young, labile, high–molecular weight proteinaceous material in bathypelagic waters. The abundance of labile proteinaceous material diminishes from epipelagic to mesopelagic waters but notably increases in bathypelagic waters, where it exhibits a short turnover time (days) and resembles surface plankton in molecular composition. This observation coincides with peak zooplankton biomass recorded over the year. The nonmonotonic depth trend suggests a deep-sea replenishment of organic particles from mesopelagic migrating zooplankton. Our results indicate the presence of labile organic molecules at bathypelagic depths and reveal a nonlinear supply of plankton-derived substrates that support microbial metabolism and carbon sequestration in the deep ocean.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of magnetization-based spintronic applications, there has been considerable interest in spin-orbit torque as an electric technique to dynamically manipulate magnetization. In this study, gate-induced ON-OFF switchable spin-orbit torque in Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device using the ionic gating technique is reported. By canceling the spin currents from Pt layers, the OFF state is attained in Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device. Notably, under a strong negative gate electric field applied to the Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device, the damping-like spin-orbit torque is markedly enhanced over sixfold compared with the applied positive gate electric field. We show that the gate modulation of the spin-orbit torque in the Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device can be explained by considering the change of the spin-charge interconversion by electric gating. This research serves as a promising avenue for electrically programmable spintronic devices.},

To further explore these mysteries, it is crucial to investigate another similar system beyond the two existing ones, SmB 6 and YbB 12 . Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U 3 Bi 4 Ni 3 . Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 kelvin and dominates transport properties below 150 kelvin, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB 6 and YbB 12 . At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected. The similarities and differences between U 3 Bi 4 Ni 3 and the other two Kondo insulators will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators and their interplay with strong electron correlations.},

  abstract     = {Whether the rapid warming of the Arctic, particularly the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS), substantially affects the Eurasian winter climate has been debated for over a decade. Here, we use an extended dynamical adjustment method to separate the effects of internal dynamics and thermodynamically forced BKS warming on atmospheric circulation, relying solely on observations. Evidence shows that the observed link between BKS warming and Eurasian cooling is influenced by both atmospheric internal variability and forced BKS warming. Internal variability, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly contributed to the observed Eurasian cooling from 1991 to 2012. While BKS warming has a weaker impact on Eurasian cooling on interannual to interdecadal timescales, it notably affects multidecadal scales, contributing to the observed “warming hole” in central Eurasia during 1980–2022. Our findings suggest a weak but non-negligible Eurasian cooling response to BKS warming on multidecadal timescales. These findings advance the understanding of the complex causal relationships between Arctic and mid-latitude climates.},

The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicating Drosophila salivary gland and Bombyx silk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr. Together, our study demonstrates that USP8 and Hsp70 regulate endoreplication by synergistically maintaining Fzr stability though deubiquitination.},

To explore their potential as detectors for ultrabroadband terahertz electromagnetic pulses, we measure the transient optical birefringence the terahertz field induces. Notably, the signal component linear in the FM magnetization agrees excellently with the shape of the incident terahertz electric field at 1 to 13 terahertz and beyond. Analysis indicates that the birefringence arises from the terahertz-field–driven spin accumulation at the FM/HM interface through the spin Rashba-Edelstein effect (SREE). Because of spin-momentum locking, the SREE decays by electron momentum relaxation in &lt;10 femtoseconds, substantially faster than a spin-Hall-effect–induced bulk spin accumulation. Our experiment demonstrates straightforward spintronic sampling of intense ultrabroadband terahertz fields with flat amplitude and phase response. Furthermore, it provides temporal signatures of the SREE and can be viewed as a versatile implementation of interface-specific terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.},

The β 2 -adrenergic receptor is an example of GPCR with high selectivity for Gαs, the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase, and much weaker for the Gαi family of G proteins inhibiting adenylyl cyclase. By developing a Gαi-biased agonist (LM189), we provide structural and biophysical evidence supporting that distinct conformations at ICL2 and TM6 are required for coupling of the different G protein subtypes Gαs and Gαi.

Despite the known links between the medial habenula (MHb) and nicotine avoidance, the ionic mechanisms underlying MHb neuronal responses to nicotine remain unclear. Here, we report that MHb neurons use a long-lasting refractory period (LLRP) as an unconventional inhibitory mechanism to curb hyperexcitability. This process is initiated by nicotine-induced calcium influx through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which activates a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). Owing to high intracellular chloride levels in MHb neurons, chloride efflux through CaCC, coupled with high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels, sustains MHb depolarization near the chloride equilibrium potential of −30 millivolts, thereby enabling LLRP. Concurrently, calcium-activated BK potassium channels counteract this depolarization, promoting LLRP termination. Our findings reveal an atypical inhibitory mechanism, orchestrated by synergistic actions between calcium-permeable and calcium-activated channels. This discovery advances our understanding of neuronal excitability control and nicotine addiction.},

Recording from a large number of units across multiple brain areas, we found that units exhibiting visual feature coding showed stronger attentional modulation of responses and spike–local field potential coherence than units without feature coding. Across brain areas, attention directed toward search targets enhanced the neuronal pattern separation of stimuli, with this enhancement more pronounced for units encoding visual features. Together, our results suggest a complex interplay between visual feature and attention coding in the primate brain, likely driven by interactions between brain areas engaged in these processes.},

Intriguingly, cell cycles of host and endosymbiont are synchronized. The molecular mechanisms underlying this notable level of integration are unknown. Previously, we identified a nucleus-encoded dynamin-like protein, called ETP9, that localizes at the endosymbiont division site of A. deanei . Here, we found by comparative genomics that endosymbionts throughout the Strigomonadinae lost the capacity to autonomously form a division septum. We describe the cell cycle–dependent subcellular localization of ETP9 that follows accumulation of the bacterium-encoded division protein FtsZ at the endosymbiont division site. Furthermore, we found that ETP9 is essential in symbiotic but dispensable in aposymbiotic A. deanei that lost the endosymbiont. In the symbiotic strain, ETP9 knockdowns resulted in filamentous, division-impaired endosymbionts. Our work unveiled that in A. deanei an endosymbiont division machinery of dual genetic origin evolved in which a neo-functionalized host protein compensates for losses of endosymbiont division genes.},

Oxidative potential (OP) has gained increasing attention as a key property that may explain PM toxicity. Using online measurement methods that impinge particles for OP quantification within seconds, we reveal that 60 to 99% of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and OP in secondary organic aerosol and combustion-generated PM have a lifetime of minutes to hours and that the ROS activity of ambient PM decays substantially before offline analysis. This implies that current offline measurement methods substantially underestimate the true OP of PM. We demonstrate that short-lived OP components activate different toxicity pathways upon direct deposition onto reconstituted human bronchial epithelia. Therefore, we suggest that future air pollution and health studies should include online OP quantification, allowing more accurate assessments of links between OP and health effects.},

  abstract     = {Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of a given outcome out of competitive events. This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler’s ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out-of-equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to d -dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path toward the study of competitive events in complex media.},

  abstract     = {Chiral molecule sensing is typically performed using techniques like chromatography, electrophoresis, enzymatic assays, mass spectrometry, and chiroptical methods. While polarimetry allows for in vivo sensing up to 1 mm depth using ultraviolet-visible light, it is limited by dominant light scattering beyond this depth. We propose that photoacoustic sensing in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window can enable deep tissue sensing as acoustic waves scatter less than light. To achieve this, we developed a photoacoustic polarization–enhanced optical rotation sensing (PAPEORS) system, capable of estimating optical rotation from photoacoustic signals and correlating it with chiral molecular concentration for depths up to 3.5 mm. Experiments were conducted using aqueous glucose solutions, naproxen, serum-based glucose samples, and ex vivo chicken tissue. PAPEORS achieved a detection limit of 80 mg/dl while using circularly polarized light with serum samples, demonstrating the potential for deep-tissue chiral molecular sensing. PAPEORS holds promise for in vivo sensing and easy miniaturization using single wavelength.},

  abstract     = {The integument plays a critical role in functional adaptation, with macro-regional specification forming structures like beaks, combs, feathers, and scales, while micro-regional specification modifies skin appendage shapes. However, the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Craniofacial integument displays dramatic diversity, exemplified by the Polish chicken (PC) with a homeotic transformation of comb-to-crest feathers, caused by a 195–base pair (bp) duplication in HoxC10 intron. Micro-C analyses show that HoxC-containing topologically associating domain (TAD) is normally closed in the scalp but open in the dorsal and tail regions, allowing multiple long-distance contacts. In the PC scalp, the TAD is open, resulting in high HoxC expression. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the 195-bp duplication reduces crest feather formation, and HoxC misexpression alters feather shapes. The 195-bp sequence is found only in Archelosauria (crocodilians and birds) and not in mammals. These findings suggest that higher-order regulation of the HoxC cluster modulates gene expression, driving the evolution of adaptive integumentary appendages in birds.},

Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2 −/− signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor. Our findings uncover Parkin’s involvement in suppressing macrophage antigen presentation for coordinating the cross-talk between macrophages and T cells.},

However, the mechanism by which assembly occurs remains poorly understood, and few intermediate states are available to illuminate the expansion of meta-stable procapsids into robust mature capsids. Here, we present the structure of a partially expanded phi29 procapsid that reveals distinct conformations of MCPs and allows visualization of SPs in multiple oligomeric states. These results suggest that formation of SP dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers drives dissociation of SP from MCP to actuate capsid expansion. Hexons expand first, and we propose penton maturation is delayed by a symmetry match with SP oligomers. We further show that the prolate shape of phi29’s capsid is possible due to concave hexons in the equatorial region of the capsid that may alter interactions with SP and explain the observed dependence of the prolate shape on SP.},

In addition, nMITO selectively targeted damaged endothelial cells via β-integrins and were delivered to injured tissues through tunneling nanotubes, enhancing their regulatory effects on inflammation and cell damage. In mouse models of acute myocardial injury, liver injury, and pancreatitis, nMITO notably reduced inflammatory responses and repaired tissue damage.

To identify druggable targets in cPIIRS, patient cerebral spinal fluid samples underwent transcriptional analysis, revealing a Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway dominance in neuroinflammatory gene signatures. MurinecPIIRS models recapitulated this pathway predominance and treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, confirmed a mechanistic requirement for this pathway in disease pathology. Ruxolitinib treatment improved markers of neuronal damage, reduced activated T cell and myeloid cells, and improved weight. On the basis of these findings, we conducted a first-in-human ruxolitinib treatment of patients with cPIIRS (NCT00001352). Ruxolitinib treatment of six patients led to demonstrated tolerability, reductions in inflammatory biomarkers and activated immune cells, and improved brain imaging. These results advocate for pathway-instructed therapeutics in neuroinflammatory diseases and endorse JAK inhibitors in further clinical studies of cPIIRS.},

Here, we report that once daily oral ODV treatment of cynomolgus and rhesus macaques for 10 days confers 80 and 100% protection, respectively, against lethal Ebola virus infection when treatment is initiated 24 hours after mucosal (conjunctival) exposure. ODV treatment delayed viral replication to abate excessive inflammation and promote adaptive immunity. For outbreak response, oral antivirals might present substantial advantages over now approved intravenous drugs, such as easy supply, storage, distribution, and administration. Furthermore, these results support the potential of ODV as an oral postexposure prophylaxis with broad spectrum activity across filoviruses.},

This nanosensor, designed to respond to the proteolytic activity of AS-associated dysregulated enzymes, entails CQDs as signal reporters to convert AS-associated proteolytic activity to fluorometric readings enabling a sensitive and cost-effective urine-based assay for early AS detection. Our findings demonstrated that the nanosensor provided distinct signals in atherosclerotic versus healthy mice at early AS stages, indicating its diagnostic potential. Moreover, toxicity tests showed no notable adverse effects, supporting its safety for diagnostic applications.

A key highlight is the successful assembly of DNA motifs in nickel-containing buffer at temperatures below 40°C, otherwise unachievable at higher temperatures or using an annealing protocol.

Ppa-ebax-1 mutants are transgenerational inheritance defective, and Ppa- EBAX-1 destabilizes the clustered microRNA family miR-2235a/miR-35.

  abstract     = {When neutral water is sprayed, oppositely charged microdroplets are formed. The close approach of oppositely charged microdroplets causes an electrical discharge and leads to luminescent emission. The light emission happens without any external voltage applied, and the electrical discharge is sufficiently energetic to excite, dissociate, or ionize surrounding neutral gas molecules. Thus, sprayed water microdroplets cause chemical reactions to occur. Similar findings to the Urey-Miller experiment were observed by spraying room temperature water microdroplets into a gas mixture containing nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, which leads to the synthesis of organic molecules containing carbon-nitrogen (C─N) bonds. These observations provide another explanation for unique reactivity at the gas-water interface, as well as a possible mechanism for making the building blocks of life on early Earth.},

Here, we introduce a liquid-bodied antibiofilm robot constructed by a dynamically cross-linked magnetic hydrogel. Leveraging the viscoelastic response of the robot enables it to adapt to complex surface topographies such as medical meshes and stents. Upon actuation, the robot can mechanically destroy the biofilm matrix, chemically deactivate bacterial cells, and collect disrupted biofilm debris. The robot’s antibiofilm performance is studied in vitro and demonstrated on a medical mesh and a biliary stent. Tracking and navigation under endoscopy and x-ray imaging in an ex vivo porcine bile duct are demonstrated. Last, in vivo antibiofilm treatment is conducted by indwelling infected stents into mice’s abdominal cavity and clearing the biofilm infection using the proposed robot.},

However, understanding their nanoscale structures and polymer component distributions remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we have developed a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy–based technique called oxygen-excluded nanoimaging. By using point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography with sulfonate-based dye molecules, we achieved nanoscale imaging of polymer blend films while specifically labeling non-oxygen domains and excluding oxygen-containing domains. This selectivity is attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged sulfonate groups in the dye molecules and the oxygen atoms in the polymer side chains. We demonstrate the applicability of oxygen-excluded nanoimaging to various polymer blend films, enabling domain identification and visualization of nanoscale structures. Our oxygen-excluded nanoimaging technique provides unique insights into the complex phase separation behavior of polymer blends at the nanoscale, opening possibilities for the nanoscale characterization of a wide range of materials beyond polymer blends.},

Here, we report a molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe for imaging fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is overexpressed on activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) even in very early fibrotic livers. This method relies on FAP-catalyzed in situ self-assembly of its substrate probe that leads to the increase of the rotational correlation time (τ R ) of probe, thereby notably amplifies T 1 MRI signal. Thanks to the superior specificity and efficiency of enzymatic reaction, our method has been validated as highly selective and sensitive to FAP in two liver fibrosis mouse models. By establishing a direct correlation between MRI signals and fibrosis activity, our method enables continuous monitoring of liver fibrotic disease progression and assessment of treatment responses.},

Two different approaches are needed to completely remove the dissolved colorants during the STRAP process including (i) adding an activated carbon (AC) adsorbent to the solvent after polymer dissolution and (ii) proper mechanical filtration of the polymer-solvent cake to remove as much solvent from the cake as possible. Colorless recycled PE can be produced by a combination of the proposed approaches (choosing the proper solvent, adding an AC adsorbent, and doing proper mechanical filtration) with minimal accumulation of colorants in the recycled STRAP solvents. This study demonstrated that high-quality STRAP low-density PE can be obtained from printed plastic films, enhancing the potential circularity of these packaging materials.},

Upon pathway initiation, generating the precise levels of the activator form of GLI depends on its concentration at the cilium tip. The mechanisms underlying this critical step in Hh signaling are unclear. We developed an assay to visualize GLI2, the primary GLI activator isoform, at single-particle resolution within the cilium. We found that GLI2 is a cargo of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. Anterograde-biased IFT loading of GLI2 in a restricted time window following pathway activation results in the tip accumulation of GLI2. Unexpectedly, we found that the conserved Hh regulator KIF7, a nonmotile kinesin, is important for the temporal control of IFT-mediated GLI2 transport and retention of GLI2 at the cilium tip. Our findings underscore a design principle where a cilia-specific cytoskeletal transport system and an Hh pathway–specific cytoskeletal protein collaboratively regulate GLI2 trafficking for Hh signaling.},

This transition capability is achieved by mastering the complex transport of large-size polycations within the channel through well-designed drain electrodes. Frame drains positioned atop the organic channel act as ion barriers, regulating the penetration and relaxation of polycations. This regulation allows our multilevel synaptic OECTs to transform from short-term depression (STD) to STD-based long-term memory, and eventually to long-term depression (LTD). Conversely, placing frame drains beneath the channel exposes the polyelectrolyte fully, hence yielding high-density logic OECTs, which have been successfully used to construct unipolar integrated circuits such as NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These achievements represent a substantial advancement in manipulating polyelectrolyte-based ionic-electronic interactions, introducing more possibilities beyond small ion-based OECTs.},

To promote the expression of target genes, two ChREBP-MLX heterodimers form a heterotetramer to bind a tandem element with two adjacent E-boxes, called carbohydrate-responsive element (ChoRE). How the ChREBP-MLX hetero-tetramerization is achieved and regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MLX phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved motif is necessary for the heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE and the transcriptional activity of the ChREBP-MLX complex. We identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as MLX kinases. High intracellular glucose-6-phosphate accumulation inhibits MLX phosphorylation and heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE, impairing ChREBP-MLX activity. Physiologically, MLX phosphorylation is necessary in Drosophila to maintain sugar tolerance and lipid homeostasis. Our findings suggest that MLX phosphorylation is a key mechanism for the ChREBP-MLX heterotetramer formation to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.},

Traditional studies focus on rapid crack-propagation detachment and account only for short-term adhesion governed by interfacial-viscoelastic dissipation, failing to explain long-term phenomena like sudden detachment after prolonged adherence and to predict corresponding adhesion lifetimes. Here, we investigate the long-term adhesion through a rheological paradigm using both theory and experiment. By considering both the bulk rheology and interfacial viscoelasticity mechanisms, we show that long-term adhesion durability is governed by the competition between them. This understanding leads to accurate lifetime predictions, which we validate through experiments. In addition, our study reveals a previously undocumented, counterintuitive phenomenon unique to long-term adhesion: the expansion of the contact area under tensile forces, in contrast to short-term adhesion in which the contact area always shrinks during detachment. This research fills a critical gap in adhesion physics.},

We analyzed 22 steroids from 148 serum samples of individuals aged 20 to 73, using 98 samples for model training and 50 for validation. Our model reflects the often-overlooked fact that aging heterogeneity expands over time and uncovers sex-specific variations in steroidogenesis. This study leveraged key markers, including cortisol (COL), which underscore the role of stress-related and sex-specific steroids in aging. The resulting model establishes a biologically meaningful and robust framework for predicting BA across diverse datasets, offering fresh insights and supporting more targeted strategies in aging research and disease management.},

  abstract     = {After an election, should election officials release a copy of each anonymous ballot? Some policy-makers have championed public disclosure to counter distrust, but others worry that it might undermine ballot secrecy. We introduce the term vote revelation to refer to the linkage of a vote on an anonymous ballot to the voter’s name in the public voter file and detail how such revelation could theoretically occur. Using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we show that the release of individual ballot records would lead to no revelation of any vote choice for 99.83% of voters as compared to 99.95% under Maricopa’s current practice of reporting aggregate results by precinct and method of voting. Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots. We discuss the potential benefits of transparency, compare remedies to reduce or eliminate privacy violations, and highlight the privacy-transparency trade-off inherent in all election reporting.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer exhibits altered metabolism, influencing its response to radiation. To investigate the metabolic regulation of radiation response, we conducted a comprehensive, metabolic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen using radiation as selection pressure in human non–small cell lung cancer. Lipoylation emerged as a key metabolic target for radiosensitization, with lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) identified as a top hit. LIPT1 covalently conjugates mitochondrial 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases with lipoic acid, facilitating enzymatic functions involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibiting lipoylation, either through genetic LIPT1 knockout or a lipoylation inhibitor (CPI-613), enhanced tumor control by radiation. Mechanistically, lipoylation inhibition increased 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to H3K9 trimethylation, disrupting TIP60 recruitment and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–mediated DNA damage repair signaling, impairing homologous recombination repair. In summary, our findings reveal a critical role of LIPT1 in regulating DNA damage and chromosome stability and may suggest a means to enhance therapeutic outcomes with DNA-damaging agents.},

Due to limitations such as lack of selectivity, traditional antibiotic therapies face obstacles in eliminating intratumoral bacteria. Herein, this work proposes the use of therapeutic vaccines to selectively target and eliminate harmful bacteria within tumors. A multivalent vaccine encapsulating both insoluble and soluble bacterial antigens was developed, addressing the shortcomings of traditional antibacterial vaccines by balancing broad antigen coverage with effective immune activation. This vaccine induces robust downstream immune responses to eliminate F. nucleatum , S. sanguis , E. faecalis , and S. xylosus , demonstrating notable therapeutic and preventive efficacy in bacteria-induced cancer metastasis models. Unexpectedly, vaccinated infected mice showed even slower tumor metastasis than uninfected mice. Overall, this study validates the potential of nanovaccines in modulating the intratumoral microbiome for tumor therapy and highlights tumor-associated bacterial infections as potential promising antitumor targets.},

In addition, they also demonstrated the ability to promote the reversible refolding of the partially or completely denatured lipase. The catalytic efficiency is completed with its more convenient handling of dynameric nanoparticles facilitating the efficient recovery and reuse of the enzyme with cost-effective uses. Molecular simulation studies revealed an in-depth understanding of how the dynamer action mechanism affects the conformational changes of lipase.

Herein, we propose an oxygen vacancy–rich (BiFe) 0.9 (BaTi) 0.1 O 3− x nanoreactor as a piezoelectric sonosensitizer by spatiotemporal ultrasound–driven sono- and chemodynamic tandem catalysis to amplify antibacterial efficacy. The piezoelectric charge carriers under a built-in electric field synchronize the reaction of O 2 and H 2 O, efficiently generating H 2 O 2 . The electron-rich oxygen vacancies modulate the local electronic structure of an Fe site. It facilitates reactive oxygen species generation by piezoelectric electrons and accelerates valence state cycles of Fe(III)/Fe(II) to achieve the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals via H 2 O 2 /Fe(II)–catalyzed chemodynamic reactions, which lead to bacterial membrane damage. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that intracellular Fe overload induced by excessive Fe(II)-mediated dysregulation of the two-component system disrupts bacterial metabolism, triggering bacterial ferroptosis-like death. Thus, the porous titanium scaffold, engineered with a piezoelectric nanoreactor, demonstrates superior antibacterial efficacy under ultrasound and facilitates osteogenesis via piezoelectric immunomodulation–activated therapy.},

However, the structural origin of the large energy barriers preventing interconversion between these folding pathways is unknown. Here, we combine simulations with limited proteolysis (LiP) and cross-linking (XL) mass spectrometry (MS) to study the protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Simulations recapitulate its stretched-exponential folding kinetics and reveal that misfolded states involving changes of entanglement underlie this behavior: either formation of a nonnative, noncovalent lasso entanglement or failure to form a native entanglement. These misfolded states act as kinetic traps, requiring extensive unfolding to escape, which results in a distribution of free energy barriers and pathway partitioning. Using LiP-MS and XL-MS, we propose heterogeneous structural ensembles consistent with these data that represent the potential long-lived misfolded states PGK populates. This structural and energetic heterogeneity creates a hierarchy of refolding timescales, explaining stretched-exponential kinetics.},

Here, we use a bidentate molecule to control ripening toward a notable performance boost in CsPbI 3 QDs. The strong interaction between QDs and the bidentate molecules maintains stable surface states of QDs, inhibiting QDs’ undesirable ripening and generation of defects.

Here, combining first-principles calculations and machine learning molecular dynamics, we unravel the interplay between perovskite octahedral lattice dynamics and energy barrier associated with ion migration. Our results show that B-site substitution, particularly with alkaline-earth and lanthanide elements, notably strengthens lattice interactions, restrains octahedral oscillation, and increases iodine-migration barriers, outperforming the commonly used A-site and X-site substitutions and interstitial doping. Moreover, the enhanced barrier aligns with the geometric factor of μτ (tolerance-octahedral product), underlining the superior effectiveness of co- and multiple-element B-site doping in lattice stabilization and ion migration suppression. Experimental validation with exemplary hysteresis-free Eu-Ca–doped perovskite single crystals demonstrates remarkable improvements in ambient stability and transport properties. These findings highlight B-site engineering as an effective microstructural strategy for controlling ion migration, with important implications for stable and lead-reduced perovskite devices.},

Enteroviruses use the cloverleaf RNA structure at the 5′ end of the genome to balance these two processes. Cloverleaf acts as a promoter for RNA synthesis and forms a complex with viral 3CD protein, the precursor to 3C pro protease, and 3D pol polymerase. The interaction between cloverleaf and 3CD is mediated by the 3C pro domain, yet how 3C pro promotes specific RNA-binding is not clear. We report the structure of coxsackievirus cloverleaf RNA-3C pro complex, wherein two 3C pro molecules interact with cloverleaf stem-loop D. 3C pro dimer mainly recognizes the shape of the dsRNA helix through symmetric interactions, suggesting that 3C pro is a previously undiscovered type of RNA binding protein. We show that 3CD protein also dimerizes on cloverleaf RNA and binds the RNA with higher affinity than 3C pro .

The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signaling directly and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction could offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein–containing complexes.},

Studying past comparable crises can offer insights, but there is no fossil evidence of diverse megafloral ecosystems surviving the largest Phanerozoic biodiversity crisis. Here, we investigated palynomorphs, plant, and tetrapod fossils from the Permian-Triassic South Taodonggou Section in Xinjiang, China. Our fossil records, calibrated by a high-resolution age model, reveal the presence of vibrant regional gymnospermous forests and fern fields, while marine organisms experienced mass extinction. This refugial vegetation was crucial for nourishing the substantial influx of surviving animals, thereby establishing a diverse terrestrial ecosystem approximately 75,000 years after the mass extinction. Our findings contradict the widely held belief that restoring terrestrial ecosystem functional diversity to pre-extinction levels would take millions of years. Our research indicates that moderate hydrological fluctuations throughout the crisis sustained this refugium, likely making it one of the sources for the rapid radiation of terrestrial life in the early Mesozoic.},

  abstract     = {To provide protection, anticipatory T cell–dependent immunity is reliant on the generation and maintenance of a naïve T cell repertoire, which is sufficiently diverse to ensure recognition of newly encountered antigens. Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial populations experience chemical gradients in nature. However, most experimental systems either ignore gradients or fail to capture gradients in mechanically relevant contexts. Here, we use microfluidic experiments and biophysical simulations to explore how host-relevant shear flow affects antimicrobial gradients across communities of the highly resistant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We discover that flow patterns gradients of three chemically distinct antimicrobials: hydrogen peroxide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin. Without flow, resistant P. aeruginosa cells generate local gradients by neutralizing all three antimicrobials through degradation or chemical modification. As flow increases, delivery overwhelms neutralization, allowing antimicrobials to penetrate deeper into bacterial populations. By imaging single cells across long microfluidic channels, we observe that upstream cells protect downstream cells, and protection is abolished in higher flow regimes. Together, our results reveal that physical flow can promote antimicrobial effectiveness, which could inspire the incorporation of flow into the discovery, development, and implementation of antimicrobials.},

Comparative characterization of PTEFb complex participation and chromatin binding indicates BRD4-redundant and BRD4-distinct BRDT functions. Unlike dual depletion, individual BRD4 or BRDT knockdown did not impair transcriptional responses to hypoxia in BRDT-expressing cells, consistent with redundant function. However, BRD4 depletion/BRDT complementation revealed that BRDT can also release paused RNA polymerase II independently of its bromodomains as we previously demonstrated not to be required for Pol II pause/release function of BRD4, underscoring the functional importance of the C-terminal domains in both BRD4 and BRDT and their potential as therapeutic targets in solid tumors.

The sensor boasts a wide sensing range (35 to 600 kPa) and a rapid response time (∼300 ms), allowing it to record and recognize individual keystroke dynamics. Integrated with machine learning, this keyboard enables identity authentication through both fixed- and dynamic-text inputs. It accurately authenticates fixed passwords of eight characters with a 95.3% success rate and dynamic text from 14 sets of double keys with 100% accuracy.

Seabird chicks heavily affected by plastic ingestion demonstrated a range of negative health consequences: Intracellular components that should not be found in the blood were frequently detected, indicative of cell lysis. Secreted proteins were less abundant, indicating that the stomach, liver, and kidneys are not functioning as normal. Alarmingly, these signatures included evidence of neurodegeneration in &lt;90-day-old seabird chicks with high levels of ingested plastic. The proteomic signatures reflect the effects of plastic distal to the site of exposure (i.e., the stomach).

We address this lack of reliability with a probabilistic deep learning method that identifies all realistic structures in seconds, redefining standards in reflectometry. Our method, prior-amortized neural posterior estimation (PANPE), combines simulation-based inference with adaptive priors that inform the inference network about known structural properties and controllable experimental conditions. PANPE networks support key scenarios such as high-throughput sample characterization, real-time monitoring of evolving structures, or the corefinement of several experimental datasets and can be adapted to provide fast, reliable, and flexible inference across many other inverse problems.},

The scheme uses cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.},

We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of eight different S-proteins from SARSr-CoVs found across Asia, Europe, and Africa. These S-proteins all adopt tightly packed, locked, prefusion conformations. These structures enable the classification of SARSr-CoV S-proteins into three types, based on their receptor-binding motif (RBM) structures and ACE2 binding characteristics. Type-2 S-proteins often preferentially bind bat ACE2 (bACE2) over hACE2. We report a structure of a type-2 BtKY72-RBD in complex with bACE2 to understand ACE2 specificity. Structure-guided mutagenesis of BtKY72-RBD reveals that multiple synergistic mutations in four different regions of RBM are required to achieve high-affinity hACE2 binding. Similar RBM changes can also confer hACE2 binding to another type-2 BM48-31 S-protein, which is primarily non-ACE2 binding. These results provide an understanding of how high-affinity hACE2 binding may be acquired by SARSr-CoV S-proteins.},

  abstract     = {Lipid homeostasis is critical to neuronal survival. ATP-binding cassette A (ABCA) proteins are lipid transporters associated with neurodegenerative diseases. How ABCA transporters regulate lipid homeostasis in neurodegeneration is an outstanding question. Here we report that the Drosophila ABCA protein engulfment ABC transporter in the ovary (Eato) regulates phagocytosis-dependent neurodegeneration by playing opposing roles in neurons and phagocytes: In neurons, Eato prevents dendrites and axons from being attacked by neighboring phagocytes; in phagocytes, Eato sensitizes the cell for detecting neurons as engulfment targets. Thus, Eato deficiency in neurons alone causes phagocytosis-dependent neurite degeneration, but additional Eato loss from phagocytes suppresses the neurite degeneration. Mechanistically, Eato functions by removing the eat-me signal phosphatidylserine from the cell surface in both neurons and phagocytes. Multiple human and worm ABCA homologs can rescue Eato loss in phagocytes but not in neurons, suggesting both conserved and cell type–specific activities of ABCA proteins. These results imply possible mechanisms of neuron-phagocyte interactions in neurodegenerative diseases.},

This work develops an interlayer confinement strategy to construct SHB networks in a two-dimensional (2D) nanocapillary assembled by bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) nanosheets and boost the ionic conductivity of HEMs. With confined nanochannels and adjustable hydrophilic groups in BiOI-based HEMs, the number of SHBs increases by 12 times, creating a shortcut for the Grotthuss-type anion transport, which in turn affords a high ionic conductivity of 168 millisiemens per centimeter at 90°C, higher than polymeric HEM and 2D-based HEM. This work demonstrates the facile approach to generating SHB networks in 2D capillaries and opens a promising avenue to developing advanced HEMs.},

Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome analyses of human and mouse muscles, we investigated pathogenic features in patients with DMD and palliative effects of glucocorticoids. Our approach further illuminated the importance of proliferating satellite cells and revealed increased activity of a signal transduction pathway involving EZH2 in the patient cells. Subsequent administration of EZH2 inhibitors to Dmd mutant mice resulted in improved muscle phenotype through maintaining the immune-suppressing effect but overriding the muscle weakness and fibrogenic effects exerted by glucocorticoids.

  abstract     = {Intrabronchial delivery of therapeutic agents is critical to the treatment of respiratory diseases. Targeted delivery is demanded because of the off-target accumulation of drugs in normal lung tissues caused by inhalation and the limited motion dexterity of clinical bronchoscopes in tortuous bronchial trees. Herein, we developed microrobotic swarms consisting of magnetic hydrogel microparticles to achieve intrabronchial targeted delivery. Under programmed magnetic fields, the microgel particle swarms performed controllable locomotion and adaptative structure reconfiguration in tortuous and air-filled environments. The swarms were further integrated with imaging contrast agents for precise tracking under x-ray fluoroscopy and computed tomography imaging. Magnetic navigation of the swarms in an ex vivo lung phantom and in vivo delivery into deep branches of the bronchial trees were achieved. The on-demand reconfiguration of swarms for avoiding the microgel particles from entering nontarget bronchi and the precise delivery into tilted bronchi through climbing motion were validated.},

  abstract     = {Fires in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) are a global issue with growing importance. However, the impact of WUI fires on air quality and health is less understood compared to that of fires in wildland. We analyze WUI fire impacts on air quality and health at the global scale using a multi-scale atmospheric chemistry model—the Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols model (MUSICA). WUI fires have notable impacts on key air pollutants [e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), and ozone (O 3 )]. The health impact of WUI fire emission is disproportionately large compared to wildland fires primarily because WUI fires are closer to human settlement. Globally, the fraction of WUI fire–caused annual premature deaths (APDs) to all fire–caused APDs is about three times of the fraction of WUI fire emissions to all fire emissions. The developed model framework can be applied to address critical needs in understanding and mitigating WUI fires and their impacts.},

Treatment reduced LBP and SASP factor release and removed SnCs from the IVD and spinal cord. Treatment also lowered degeneration scores in the IVDs, improved vertebral bone quality, and reduced the expression of pain markers in the spinal cord.

The boot sock method provided more sensitive detection of E. coli and lower inter-replicate variation compared to grab samples. Post hoc power analyses indicated that the boot sock technique required fewer samples to achieve adequate spatial representation across a sampling area than grab samples, potentially improving time and cost efficiency in pathogen exposure risk estimation.},

This platform comprises a high-resolution closed-loop video imaging system, coupled with a deep learning network to annotate 35 body parts, and a computational pipeline to extract behaviors from high-dimensional data. FlyVISTA reveals the distinct spatiotemporal dynamics of sleep and wake-associated microbehaviors at baseline, following administration of the sleep-inducing drug gaboxadol, and with dorsal fan-shaped body drivers. We identify a microbehavior (“haltere switch”) exclusively seen during quiescence that indicates a deeper sleep stage. These results enable the rigorous analysis of sleep in Drosophila and set the stage for computational analyses of microbehaviors in quiescent animals.},

However, one of the major roadblocks in implementing OAM-based applications with their full potentials is the absence of an ideal OAM-mode detector. Despite the plethora of efforts in the last three decades, currently, there is no OAM detector that can detect a broad OAM-mode spectrum, has uniform detection-efficiency over all the modes, measures the true spectrum, and works for an arbitrary quantum state without the need for any previous information. Here, we experimentally demonstrate just such an OAM detector. We report detection of pure and mixed OAM states with fidelities more than 98% and with measurement times of only a few minutes for dimensionalities up to 100. We expect our work to substantially boost the OAM-based photonic quantum technology efforts.},

Our previous study, using the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model, revealed an increase of U6 snRNA in plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) in acute retroviral infection. Given the limited understanding of U6 snRNA dynamics across cells and EVs, particularly in SIV infection, this research explores U6 snRNA trafficking and its association with splicing proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and EVs. We observed a redistribution of U6 snRNA from the nucleus to EVs post-infection, accompanied by distinct protein profile changes and alterations in nucleic acid metabolism and spliceosome pathways. In addition, U6 machinery proteins changed in cells and EVs in a contrasting manner. The redistribution of U6 and related proteins we observed could be part of a viral strategy to redirect host splicing machinery, suggesting that U6 may have regulatory roles and be part of retroviral infection signature.},

Here we report that the spleen is the backup immune organ to clear the liver-resistant serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a leading human pathogen. Asplenic mice failed to control the growth of the liver-resistant pneumococci in the blood circulation. Immunologic and genetic analyses identified splenic red pulp (RP) macrophages as the major phagocytes for bacterial clearance. Furthermore, the plasma natural antibodies against the cell wall phosphocholine and the complement system were necessary for RP macrophage–mediated immunity. These findings have provided a conceptual framework for the innate defense against blood bacterial infections, a mechanistic explanation for the hyper-susceptibility of asplenic individuals to S. pneumoniae , and a proof of concept for developing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against encapsulated pathogens.},

Thiamine thiazole synthase (Bcthi4) was identified as a target protein of Z24 by drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Molecular docking and enzyme activity experiments have demonstrated that Z24 can affect the function of Bcthi4. Last, mechanistic studies show that Z24 inhibits thiamine biosynthesis by binding to Bcthi4 and induces up-regulation of alternative splicing [alternative 5′ splice site (A5SS)] of the Bcthi4 gene. In conclusion, by targeting Bcthi4, Z24 has the potential to be developed as a previously unidentified anti– B. cinerea candidate.},

The neuropeptide Y (NPY) system, best known for its role in controlling energy homeostasis, has also been shown to promote tumorigenesis in a range of cancer types, but its role in PC has yet to be explored. We show that expression of NPY and NPY1R are up-regulated in mouse PC models and human patients with PC. Moreover, using the genetically engineered, autochthonous KP R172H C mouse model of PC, we demonstrate that pancreas-specific and whole-body knockout of Npy1r significantly decreases metastasis to the liver. We identify that treatment with the NPY1R antagonist BIBO3304 significantly reduces KP R172H C migratory capacity on cell-derived matrices. Pharmacological NPY1R inhibition in an intrasplenic model of PC metastasis recapitulated the results of our genetic studies, with BIBO3304 significantly decreasing liver metastasis. Together, our results reveal that NPY/NPY1R signaling is a previously unidentified antimetastatic target in PC.},

Disruption of large-scale functional connectivity in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) has been widely reported, but the biological factors driving these changes remain unclear. We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals. These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.},

Here, we investigate how thermosensory learning shapes our subjective experience of temperature and the misperception of pain in response to harmless thermal stimuli. Through computational modeling, we demonstrate that the brain uses a probabilistic predictive coding scheme to update beliefs about temperature changes based on their uncertainty. We find that these expectations directly modulate the perception of pain in the thermal grill illusion. Quantitative microstructural brain imaging further revealed that individual variability in computational parameters related to uncertainty-driven learning and decision-making is reflected in the microstructure of brain regions such as the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, as well as basal ganglia and brainstem. These findings provide a framework to understand how the brain infers pain from innocuous thermal inputs, with important implications for the etiology of thermosensory symptoms under chronic pain conditions.},

However, the question of whether supercritical water is still hydrogen-bonded or how water molecules interact en route to the supercritical regime is a matter of controversial discussions. We present terahertz (THz) spectra, which directly probe the intermolecular interactions of water under these extreme conditions. While we spectroscopically detect the liquid-gas phase transition just below the critical point, THz spectra of the high-temperature gas phase are indistinguishable from those of supercritical water at the same density. The accompanying ab initio simulations provide the molecular underpinnings: The water-water contacts at supercritical conditions are essentially orientationally random.},

  abstract     = {Whether restoration actions achieve full ecological recovery is still debated. This is particularly controversial in the marine realm, where the success of restoration is mostly evaluated in terms of the short-term survival of transplanted organisms. In view of this, we combined population and trait-based approaches to explore the long-term effectiveness of active restoration of a key Mediterranean octocoral. For this purpose, an assemblage with restored Corallium rubrum colonies was monitored over 10 years and compared with a nearby reference site. Our results revealed growth of the transplanted colonies followed by a change in the functional structure (i.e., dominance and diversity of traits) of the restored assemblage. This change was related not only to the development of the coral but also to the arrival and/or increase of species with different traits. Overall, our findings provide an example of how active restoration of long-lived octocorals can be an effective tool for recovering high-diverse coralligenous assemblages at decadal timescales.},

This study uses an in vitro human cerebral organoid model with multiomic analysis, integrating advanced microscopies and single-cell RNA sequencing, to monitor tissue oxygen tension during neural development. Results reveal a key period between weeks 4 and 6 with elevated intra-organoid oxygen tension, altered energy homeostasis, and rapid neurogenesis within the organoids. The timed oxygen tension elevation can be suppressed by hypoxia treatment or silencing of neuroglobin gene. This study provides insights into the role of oxygen in early neurogenesis from functional, genotypic, phenotypic, and proteomic aspects. These findings highlight the significance of the timed tissue oxygen tension elevation in neurogenesis and provide insights into the role of neuroglobin in neural development, with potential implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and therapeutic strategies.},

This study focuses on the fundamental dynamics of vortex-pair fields, specifically known as vortex-pair beams (VPBs) in optics. VPBs have gained increasing attention due to their unique properties, including vortex attraction and repulsion. Here, we explore the dynamics of pure-phase VPBs (PPVPBs) and observe intriguing helical and intertwined behaviors of vortices, resembling a vortex-pair dance. We uncover the oscillation property of the intervortex distance for PPVPBs in free space. The observed dancing and oscillation phenomena are intricately tied to the initial intervortex distance and can be explained well in the hydrodynamic picture. Notably, the vortex dancing and oscillation alter the process of vortex-pair annihilation, extending the survival range for opposite vortices. This discovery enhances our understanding of vortex interactions and sheds light on the intricate dynamics of both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex interactions.},

Although chromatin intratumoral heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of GBM, most current studies are conducted at a single tumor site. To investigate the GBM-specific 3D genome organization and its heterogeneity, we conducted Hi-C experiments in 21 GBM samples from nine patients, along with three normal brain samples. We identified genome subcompartmentalization and chromatin interactions specific to GBM, as well as extensive intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity at these levels. We identified copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs) and demonstrated how they disrupted 3D genome structures. SVs could not only induce enhancer hijacking but also cause the loss of enhancers to the same gene, both of which contributed to gene dysregulation. Our findings provide insights into the GBM-specific 3D genome organization and the intratumoral heterogeneity of this organization and open avenues for understanding this devastating disease.},

In this work, a minimally invasive annular microneedle (A-MN) patch was developed avoiding direct puncture into the central cornea for ophthalmic drug delivery. The feasible mechanical strength of A-MNs was achieved by adjusting the ratio of PVP-β-CD and PVA to puncture the cornea barrier. Through effective diffusion to corneal stroma, bioavailability of hydrophilic small-molecule drugs, hydrophobic drugs, and macromolecular protein drugs through an A-MN patch was 24.36, 17.47, and 5.36 times higher than that of free drug administration. A-MNs effectively maintained light transmittance of the cornea with a light transmittance of 96.33 to 100%, which was higher than that of S-MNs. Furthermore, A-MNs effectively avoided corneal tissue and nerve damage along with the pain. The efficiency and safety of A-MNs were also examined through both an in vitro cell experiment and an in vivo animal experimental model, which showed great potential in clinical application.},

Herein, we employ the operando quick-scan x-ray absorption fine structure (Q-XAFS) technique coupled with in situ controlled electrochemical potential to establish a structure-activity correlation of the OER catalyst. Using Ni-Fe bimetallic phosphides as a model catalyst, operando Q-XAFS experiments reveal that the structural transformation initiates at the preferential oxidation of Fe sites over Ni sites. The in situ–generated O-Fe-P structure serves as the origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity of the catalyst, a finding supported by theoretical calculations. This work provides crucial insights into understanding the reaction mechanism of the state-of-the-art Ni-Fe–based OER electrocatalysts, thus advancing the rational design of more efficient OER electrocatalysts.},

HuPBMC EAE mice generated from EBV-seronegative healthy donors were less susceptible to developing severe neurological symptoms than healthy EBV-seropositive and RRMS donor groups. Donor EBV seropositivity and RRMS diagnosis were associated with a significant increase in the number of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating effector T cells due to enhanced proliferation of proinflammatory T cells and limited expansion of regulatory T cells.

Floquet PT-symmetric systems are characterized by time-periodic Hamiltonians, in which the gain or loss is modulated to steer the PT phase, providing an additional dimension for realizing phase transitions. In this study, we introduce frequency-varying modulation, specifically spatially chirped modulation, into on-chip Floquet PT-symmetric photonic waveguides to explore their unique properties. The waveguides exhibit distinct forward and backward transmissions when the system dynamically evolves around phase transition points, i.e., exceptional points. Furthermore, reconfigurable asymmetric transmission systems are developed by integrating tunable mode switches.

However, the detailed pausing mechanism and the involvement of the +1 nucleosome remain enigmatic. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of ECs stalled on nucleosomal DNA. In the absence of TFIIS, the EC is backtracked/arrested due to conflicts between NELF and the nucleosome. We identified two alternative binding modes of NELF, one of which reveals a critical contact with the downstream DNA through the conserved NELF-E basic helix. Upon binding with TFIIS, the EC progressed to the nucleosome to establish a paused EC with a partially unwrapped nucleosome. This paused EC strongly restricts EC progression further downstream.

While these differences receive increasing attention in isolation, they likely link to similar processes in the brain. Hence, this review aims to present an overview of the influences of sex chromosomes, hormones, and aging on male and female brains across health and disease, with a particular focus on AD and stroke. The focus here on advancements across several fields holds promise to fuel future research and to lead to an enriched understanding of the brain and more effective personalized neurologic care for all.},

  abstract     = {Caspase-11 is an innate immune pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that detects cytosolic bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) through its caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). Caspase-11 also detects eukaryotic (i.e., self) lipids. This observation raises the question of whether common or distinct mechanisms govern caspase interactions with self- and nonself-lipids. In this study, using biochemical, computational, and cell-based assays, we report that the caspase-11 CARD functions as a bipartite lipid-binding module. Distinct regions within the CARD bind to phosphate groups and long acyl chains of self- and nonself-lipids. Self-lipid binding capability is conserved across numerous caspase-11 homologs and orthologs. The symmetry in self- and nonself-lipid detection mechanisms enabled us to engineer an LPS-binding domain de novo, using an ancestral CARD-like domain present in the fish Amphilophus citrinellus . These findings offer insights into the molecular basis of LPS recognition by caspase-11 and highlight the fundamental and likely inseparable relationship between self and nonself discrimination.},

Compared to pure MXene (fracture strain: 4.6%, toughness: 0.6 MJ/m 3 ), [2]rotaxane-bridged MXene (RBM) films achieve record-high strain (20.0%) and toughness (11.9 MJ/m 3 ) with only 3.6% [2]rotaxane by weight. Additionally, RBM films endure 500 stretch cycles (0 to 15% strain) with stable and reversible resistance alterations, making them ideal for stretchable electrodes. Notably, RBM films enable stretchable electroluminescent devices with reliable operation under 20% elongation and customizable luminescent patterns.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects. Our study offers a perspective for advancing MSC-based therapies in tissue repair.},

Analogous to magnetic stirrers, AVS arrays perturb the fluid through oscillating pressure nodes, controllable in terms of speeds and amplitudes via modulation. By optimizing the kinetics of surface-tethered DNA and enzymes via AVS, we achieve a 7.74% improvement in the stepwise yield of enzymatic DNA synthesis. In addition, the AVS enhanced DNA logic gate architecture can complete responses within 2 minutes, achieving average speed enhancement of 8.58 times compared to the non-AVS configuration.

While the transition to motherhood has recently been recognized as one of the most neuroplastic periods in adulthood, no study has yet explored whether the hippocampus and amygdala change during the peripartum in relation to childbirth experience and perinatal depression symptoms. In this longitudinal neuroimaging study, we assessed 88 first-time gestational mothers in late pregnancy and early postpartum and 30 nulliparous control women. We used optimized high-resolution MRI scans to quantify volumetric changes in the hippocampus and amygdala, along with their substructures. We found that increases in depression symptoms during the peripartum were positively correlated with changes in the right amygdala. A more challenging birth experience was associated with bilateral increases in hippocampal volume. These findings show that studying the neuroanatomical changes during the transition to motherhood can inform not only about adaptive processes but also about potential vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of tracking perinatal experiences to enhance women’s health.},

Palm1 binds to the amino-terminal region of βII-spectrin, and MINFLUX microscopy localizes it in close proximity (&lt;20 nanometers) to the actin-capping protein and MPS component adducin. Combining overexpression, knockout, and rescue experiments, we observe that the expression level of Palm1 controls the degree of periodicity of the MPS and also affects the electrophysiological properties of neurons. A single amino acid mutation (W54A) in Palm1 abolishes the MPS binding and remodeling activities of Palm1.

High HLA evolutionary divergence (HED) at the DQ locus in the donor was an independent predictor of BKPyV-free outcome. More generally, we highlighted the protective effect of highly divergent pairs of HLA-DQ heterodimers corresponding to heterozygous HLA-DQα01/non-DQα01 combinations. We then defined a functional divergence metrics assessed by the similarity of peptide-binding motifs between pairs of HLA-DQ molecules. Greater functional divergence correlated with the size of the BKPyV-derived DQ-bound immunopeptidome and a lower risk of BKPyV reactivation, thus providing a molecular basis for the observed genetic differences. Together, these data provide evidence for a direct link between donor HLA-DQ genetic and functional divergence, diversity of the DQ-bound immunopeptidome, and control of viral infection, likely reflecting stronger antiviral T cell responses.},

However, the rise of drug-resistant MAC necessitates the development of alternative therapeutics. Here, we present a late-stage boron-mediated aglycon delivery strategy for selective modification of AZM, generating a library of potential anti-MAC drugs designated KU01 to KU13 . Screening of KU01 to KU13 revealed that KU13 exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against wild-type and macrolide-resistant MAC compared to AZM. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis indicated that the inserted tercyclic moiety of KU13 formed a robust anchor on the bacterial ribosome, creating a binding pocket with base flipping of U2847, potentially bypassing the standard mechanism of macrolide resistance. These results position KU13 as a promising lead for therapeutics against macrolide-resistant MAC.},

Facultative diapause occurs under conditions of maternal metabolic stress such as nursing. While molecular mechanisms of diapause have been studied, a natural inducing factor has yet to be identified. Here, we show that oxytocin induces embryonic diapause in mice. We show that gestational delays were triggered during nursing or optogenetic stimulation of oxytocin neurons simulating nursing patterns. Mouse blastocysts express oxytocin receptors, and oxytocin induced delayed implantation-like dispersion in cultured embryos. Last, oxytocin receptor–knockout embryos transferred into wild-type surrogates had low survival rates during diapause. Our results indicate that oxytocin coordinates timing of embryonic development with uterine progression through pregnancy, providing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for ensuring successful reproduction.},

  abstract     = {We review the literature on the gender gap in well-being, identifying two key paradoxes. First, although women today report higher levels of life satisfaction and overall happiness than men, they experience worse outcomes in mental health and negative affect. Second, despite substantial advances in women’s social and economic status over the past 50 years, their well-being relative to men has declined. We explore the evidence supporting these paradoxes, considering potential explanations related to differential expectations, biology, and scale use. Using global data from 2006 to 2023 and long-term data from Europe and the US since the 1970s, we provide empirical illustrations. These findings reveal a diverse and seemingly inconsistent pattern of gender well-being gaps between countries, suggesting that the first paradox is not universally applicable. However, there is clear global evidence of a relative decline in women’s well-being, particularly in terms of negative affect.},

We tested the extent to which menopausal hormone therapy (HT) use is associated with later-life amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau accumulation using PET on N = 146 baseline clinically normal women, aged 51 to 89 years. Women were scanned over a 4.5-year (SD, 2.1; range, 1.3 to 10.4) and 3.5-year (SD, 1.5; range, 1.2 to 8.1) period for Aβ and tau, respectively, ~14 years after the initiation of HT. In older women (aged &gt;70 years), HT users exhibited faster regional tau accumulation relative to non-users, localized to the entorhinal cortex and the inferior temporal and fusiform gyri, with an indirect effect of HT on cognitive decline through regional tau accumulation. In younger women (aged &lt;70 years), HT associations with tau accumulation were negligible. Findings are relevant for optimizing menopausal treatment guidelines.},

However, the controlled synthesis of 2D OLHs with in-plane tunable emission remains a great challenge owing to the difficulty in the sequential integration of multiple components. Here, a cascaded strategy is demonstrated for the hierarchical assembly of OLHs with in-plane multicolor emission, from red-blue and red-green to lateral red-green-blue (RGB), with a lateral size of ~15 micrometers. The tunable regions of 2D OLHs are realized by synergistic effects of the molecular doping method and the photo-induced oxidation route during the epitaxial growth process. The obtained OLHs can actively achieve full-spectrum light transport from 420 to 720 nanometers depending on different excitation positions and thus function as multimode RGB signal converters. These findings provide insights into the epitaxial growth of OLHs for the development of next-generation organic optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Learning and memory deficits, including spatial navigation difficulties, are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Several ASD mouse models ( Scn2a +/− , Fmr1 −/− , Cdkl5 −/− ) exhibit impaired spatial learning, with these deficits often attributed to hippocampal dysfunction. However, we identify the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as a critical driver of these deficits. Cortical-wide Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons replicated the spatial learning and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments—a cellular correlate of learning—seen in Scn2a +/− mice, while hippocampal-wide reduction did not. PRC-specific viral-mediated Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons decreased release probability, which consequently disrupted synaptic transmission and LTP in the hippocampus, as well as spatial learning. As PRC activity was reduced, chemogenetic activation of the PRC reversed these deficits in Scn2a +/− mice and rescued spatial learning and LTP impairments in Fmr1 and Cdkl5 knockout mice. Thus, in several genetic models of ASD, PRC abnormalities may disrupt hippocampal function to impair learning and memory.},

Earlier estrogen depletion—via earlier menopause—has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD. Interventions addressing both hormonal factors and synaptic health could enhance resilience to dementia in women.},

We used multiplexed glycan immunofluorescence to distinguish between PDAC and noncancer cell subpopulations within tumor tissue, and we developed hybrid glycan sandwich assays to determine whether the aberrant glycan signatures could be detected in blood samples. We found that PDAC cells were identified by signatures of glycans detected by four glycan-binding proteins (VVL, CA19-9, sTRA, and GM2) and that there are three types of glycan-defined PDAC tumors: sTRA type, CA19-9 type, and intermixed. In patient-matched tumor and blood samples, the PDAC tumor type could be determined by the aberrant glycans in the blood. As a result, the combined assays of aberrant glycan signatures were more sensitive and specific than any individual assay. Our results demonstrate a methodology to detect and stratify PDAC.},

Select genes on the Xi underwent activation, with new escape across cells including in the dentate gyrus, critical to learning and memory. Expression of the Xi escapee Plp1 , a myelin component, was increased in the aging hippocampus of female mice and parahippocampus of women.

However, the catabolic/regulatory networks underlying this ecophysiological feat at the thermodynamic limit are essentially unknown. Integrating cultivation-based (80 conditions) proteogenomics of six representative Desulfobacteraceae spp., we identify molecular commonalities explaining the family’s environmental relevance and success. Desulfobacteraceae genomes are specifically enriched in substrate uptake, degradation capacities, and regulatory functions including fine-tuned sulfate uptake. Conserved gene arrangements and shared regulatory patterns translate into strikingly similar (sub-)proteome profiles. From 319 proteins, we constructed a meta-network for catabolizing 35 substrates. Therefrom, we defined a Desulfobacteraceae characteristic gene subset, which we found prevalent in metagenomes of organic-rich, marine sediments.

Systematic investigations demonstrated that citrulline exhibited antiaging effects by reducing cellular senescence, protecting against DNA damage, preventing cell cycle arrest, modulating macrophage metabolism, and mitigating inflammaging. Long-term citrulline supplementation in aged mice yielded beneficial effects and ameliorated age-associated phenotypes. We further elucidated that citrulline acts as an endogenous metabolite antagonist to inflammation, suppressing proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Mechanistically, citrulline served as a potential inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in macrophage and regulated the mTOR–hypoxia-inducible factor 1α–glycolysis signaling pathway to counter inflammation and aging. These findings underscore the significance of citrulline deficiency as a driver of aging, highlighting citrulline supplementation as a promising therapeutic intervention to counteract aging-related changes.},

However, the mechanisms governing cardiomyocyte fate decisions remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, genetically encoded biosensors, and in toto live imaging, we observe intrinsic variations in erbb2 expression and its association with trabecular fate. Specifically, erbb2 promotes PI3K activity and recruits the Arp2/3 complex, inducing a polarized accumulation of the actomyosin network to drive cell delamination. Subsequently, the lineage-committed nascent trabeculae trigger Notch activity in neighboring cardiomyocytes to suppress erbb2 expression and reduce cell tension, thereby confining them to the compact layer. Overall, this genetic and cellular interplay governs compact and trabecular cell fate determination to orchestrate myocardial pattern formation.},

Here, we performed an in-depth examination of B cells following rewilding, the controlled release of inbred laboratory mice into an outdoor enclosure. In rewilded mice, we observed B cells in circulation with increased signs of maturation, alongside heightened germinal center responses within secondary lymphoid organs. Rewilding also expanded B cells in the gut, which was accompanied by elevated systemic levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies reactive to the microbiota. Our findings indicate that exposing laboratory mice to a more natural environment enhances B cell development to better reflect the immune system of free-living mammals.},

If accurate, such age-driven skill losses pose a major threat to the human capital of societies with rapidly aging populations. We estimate actual age-skill profiles from individual changes in literacy and numeracy skills at different ages. We use the unique German longitudinal component of the Programme of the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC-L) that retested a large representative sample of adults after 3.5 years. Our empirical approach separates age from cohort effects and corrects for measurement error from reversion to the mean. Two main results emerge. First, average skills increase strongly into the forties before decreasing slightly in literacy and more strongly in numeracy. Second, skills decline at older ages only for those with below-average skill usage. White-collar and higher-educated workers with above-average usage show increasing skills even beyond their forties. Women have larger skill losses at older age, particularly in numeracy.},

Despite advances of different adhesive ophthalmic drugs in extending release, cornea and eyelid nonselective adhesion inevitably causes ocular discomfort and even damage. Here, we describe in situ formation of an adhesive lubricative Janus nanocoating (ALJN) to enable long-lasting comfort drug delivery. By iron complexation, an asymmetric ALJN is formed on ocular surface via facile sequential instillation. The adhesive polyphenol inner layer binding with ocular surface enables drug loading and sustained release, while the lubricative zwitterionic polymer outer layer prevents eyelid adhesion to ensure comfort. Following instillation, ALJN retains on ocular surface over 24 hours and reduces blinking frequency to normal level. Moreover, ALJN demonstrates remarkable therapeutic potential in mouse and rabbit models of corneal contusion and alkali burn. This work proposes a comfortable long-lasting topical delivery platform for treating various ocular diseases.},

Myeloid cell “trained immunity” describes persistent innate immune cell memory arising from prior exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, leading to an enhanced immune response to subsequent unrelated stimuli. We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of macrophages trained previously with β-glucan or heme exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone, which was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase–mediated tissue factor decryption. Furthermore, splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan–trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Moreover, hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid from β-glucan–trained mice had enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice. Trained immunity and associated metabolic perturbations may therefore represent an opportunity for targeted intervention in immunothrombotic disease development.},

Here, RNA-seq displayed that the expression of GPR132 was reduced in activated NK cells, and the proportion of mature NK cells in GPR132 −/− mice was substantially increased compared to WT mice, with stronger anti-melanoma capabilities. Further investigation indicates that GPR132-deficient NK92 cells expressed more GzmB and IFN-γ and exhibited stronger cytotoxicity. Mechanically, GPR132 regulates NK cell function through the CSK/ZAP70/NF-κB signaling axis. Down-regulation of GPR132 weakens the inhibition of NK cell function by lactate, thereby enhancing the functional execution of CAR-NK cells against colorectal cancer.

We establish a direct geochemical link between DT volcanism as recorded in marine osmium isotopic data and global climate change documented in benthic foraminifera carbon and oxygen isotope records. Based on our state-of-the-art astronomically calibrated age model, two major shifts in marine 187 Os/ 188 Os at 66.49 and 66.28 million years ago are contemporaneous with major eruption phases of the DT and disruptions of the global carbon cycle. Geochemical records and modeling suggest larger erupted volumes with high volatile emissions for the early phase of DT volcanism and point to differing emissions of SO 2 and CO 2 during the observed marine osmium shifts with diverse effects on the global climate system.},

  abstract     = {Defective apoptosis mediated by B cell lymphoma 2 antagonist/killer (BAK) or B cell lymphoma 2–associated X protein (BAX) underlies various pathologies including autoimmune and degenerative conditions. On mitochondria, voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) interacts with BAK and BAX through a common interface to inhibit BAK or to facilitate BAX apoptotic activity. We identified a small molecule (WEHI-3773) that inhibits interaction between VDAC2 and BAK or BAX revealing contrasting effects on their apoptotic activity. WEHI-3773 inhibits apoptosis mediated by BAX by blocking VDAC2-mediated BAX recruitment to mitochondria. Conversely, WEHI-3773 promotes BAK-mediated apoptosis by limiting inhibitory sequestration by VDAC2. In cells expressing both pro-apoptotic proteins, apoptosis promotion by WEHI-3773 dominates, because activated BAK activates BAX through a feed-forward mechanism. Loss of BAX drives resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in some leukemias. WEHI-3773 overcomes this resistance by promoting BAK-mediated killing. This work highlights the coordination of BAX and BAK apoptotic activity through interaction with VDAC2 that may be targeted therapeutically.},

Here, we investigate (i) whether opening of KCNQ2 channels requires a concerted step or can result from independent subunit activation and (ii) how individual subunits regulate gate opening and conductance. The E140R mutation in the S2 segment prevents activated voltage sensor conformations, but concatemeric constructs containing up to three E140R subunits retain KCNQ2-like currents. The underlying single-channel currents show subconductance levels resulting from limitations in inner gate dimensions, determined by the number of activated subunits and their spatial arrangement. Channel opening is allosteric and requires activation of only a single subunit, which can accentuate the influence of clinically relevant heterozygous mutations at threshold voltages.},

However, current AWW projections from state-of-the-art climate models carry uncertainties. Using observational datasets and CMIP6 model simulations, we demonstrate that the observed historical global warming trend and the climatological mean pattern of Arctic sea ice can serve as effective constraints on AWW projections. Under SSP2-4.5, the constrained warming by the end of the century is reduced from 5.5° to 4.6°C. Similarly, the projected wetting decreases from 6.8 to 5.7 millimeter per month. The inter-model spread in warming and wetting is reduced by 25 and 15%, respectively. The reduction is the largest in the Barents-Kara seas, reducing warming by 1.2°C, lessening wetting by 1.7 millimeter per month, and decreasing the inter-model spread by one-third. Our findings suggest that unconstrained CMIP6 projections overestimate future AWW, particularly in the Barents-Kara seas, due to an overestimation of historical global warming and excessive sea ice in the models.},

Here, we reveal the nongenomic molecular mechanism of progesterone as the activation of human and murine inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir7.1, which is expressed in myometrium and placental pericytes during late gestation. Kir7.1 is also activated by selective steroids, including those used to prevent premature labor, such as 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and dydrogesterone, revealing their unexpected mode of action. Our results reveal that Kir7.1 is the molecular target of both endogenous and synthetic steroids that control uterine excitability and placental function.

We show that these emergent features can be used to predict mechanical property enhancements arising from postspin drawing. Simulations recapitulate a purely process-dependent mechanical property envelope in which order enhances fiber strength while preserving toughness. The relationship between chain extension and crystalline domain alignment observed in simulations is validated by Raman spectroscopy of wet-spun fibers. Property enhancements attributed to the progression of anisotropic extension are verified by mechanical tests of drawn silk fibers and justified by theory. These findings elucidate how drawing enhances properties of protein-based fibers and shed light on how to incorporate this effect into predictive models.},

Pseudomonas aeruginosa assembles the type VI secretion system (H1-T6SS) to precisely retaliate against aggressive competing bacteria. However, we lack an understanding of how the H1-T6SS assembly dynamically responds to nanomechanical forces. To address this, we analyzed live cells using correlative atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy. We show that indentation forces above 7 nanonewtons trigger local, repeated and targeted H1-T6SS assemblies within seconds of impact by the AFM tip. Analysis of the corresponding AFM force curves shows that a breach of a single layer of the cell envelope is necessary and sufficient for triggering H1-T6SS assembly. Accordingly, polymyxin B nonapeptide, which damages the outer membrane, also triggers H1-T6SS assembly. This suggests that P. aeruginosa has evolved a danger-sensing mechanism that enables rapid and precise deployment of its antibacterial H1-T6SS in response to breaches in the outer membrane.},

  abstract     = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are primarily genetic in ~20% of patients. Mutations in C9ORF72 are the most frequent cause, but it is not understood why there is notable regional pathology. An increased burden of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in ALS-FTLD brains implicates mitochondrial mechanisms; however, it remains unclear how and when these mutations arise. To address this, we generated cerebral organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of patients with ALS-FTLD harboring the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion alongside CRISPR-corrected isogenic and healthy controls. Here, we show a higher mtDNA single-nucleotide variant (mtSNV) burden in astroglia derived from C9ORF72 -mutant organoids, with some de novo mtSNVs likely due to the C9ORF72 repeat and others evading selection to reach higher heteroplasmy levels. Thus, the functional consequences of the regional accumulation of mtSNVs in C9ORF72 ALS-FTLD brains are likely to manifest through astroglial mitochondrial dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {Circadian rhythms orchestrate physiological processes such as metabolism, immune function, and tissue regeneration, aligning them with the optimal time of day (TOD). This study identifies an interplay between the circadian clock within muscle stem cells (SCs) and their capacity to modulate the immune microenvironment during muscle regeneration. We reveal that the SC clock triggers TOD–dependent inflammatory gene transcription after injury, particularly genes related to neutrophil activity and chemotaxis. These responses are driven by cytosolic regeneration of the signaling metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), as enhancing cytosolic NAD + regeneration in SCs is sufficient to induce inflammatory responses that influence muscle regeneration. Mononuclear single-cell sequencing of the regenerating muscle niche further implicates the cytokine CCL2 in mediating SC-neutrophil cross-talk in a TOD-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the intersection between SC metabolic shifts and immune responses within the muscle microenvironment, dictated by circadian rhythms, and underscore the potential for targeting circadian and metabolic pathways to enhance tissue regeneration.},

However, the role of isocyanic acid in inflammatory response remains elusive. Herein, we reveal that lipopolysaccharide stimulation increases LACC1-dependent isocyanic acid production, which attenuates inflammation by limiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages primed with lipopolysaccharide for 8 hours. Mechanistically, isocyanic acid directly carbamoylates NLRP3 at lysine-593 to disrupt NLRP3-NEK7 interaction, a key step in assembly of active NLRP3 inflammasome. Abrogation of isocyanic acid biosynthesis by LACC1 / Lacc1 knockout or expression of K593 carbamoylation (K593ca)–deficient NLRP3 mutant promotes macrophagic inflammatory response in vitro. Furthermore, Lacc1 −/− mice and mice harboring K593ca-deficient NLRP3 mutation manifest exacerbated inflammatory response in vivo. Hence, our findings identify isocyanic acid as an endogenous immunoregulatory metabolite that limits NLRP3-driven inflammation and provide valuable insights into the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, governed by metabolites.},

Using snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, we analyzed ~800,000 and 400,000 nuclei, respectively. We observed cell-type–specific dysregulation related to clinical diagnosis and genetic risk. Dysregulation in gene expression and chromatin accessibility associated with diagnosis was pronounced in excitatory neurons. Conversely, genetic risk predominantly affected glial and endothelial cells. Notably, INO80E and HCN2 genes exhibited dysregulation in excitatory neurons’ superficial layers 2/3 influenced by schizophrenia polygenic risk.

  abstract     = {The loss of TBK1, or both TBK1 and the related kinase IKKε, results in uncontrolled cell death–driven inflammation. Here, we show that the pathway leading to cell death depends on the nature of the activating signal. Previous models suggest that in steady state, TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die slowly and spontaneously predominantly by uncontrolled tumor necrosis factor–RIPK1–driven death. However, upon infection of cells that express the NLRP3 inflammasome, (e.g., macrophages), with pathogens that activate this pathway (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes ), TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die rapidly, prematurely, and exclusively by enhanced NLRP3-driven pyroptosis. Even infection with the RIPK1-activating pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis , results in enhanced RIPK1–caspase-8 activation and enhanced secondary NLRP3 activation. Mechanistically, TBK1/IKKε control endosomal traffic, and their loss disrupts endosomal homeostasis, thereby signaling cell stress. This results in premature NLRP3 activation even upon sensing “signal 2” alone, without the obligatory “signal 1.” Collectively, TBK1/IKKε emerge as a central brake in limiting death-induced inflammation by both RIPK1 and NLRP3 death-inducing pathways.},

Few compounds selectively targeting GluN2 subunits with antidepressant effects have been identified. Here, we present YY-23, a compound that selectively inhibits GluN2C- or GluN2D-containing NMDARs. Cryo-EM analysis revealed that YY-23 binds to the transmembrane domain of the GluN2D subunit. YY-23 primarily affects GluN2D-containing NMDARs on GABAergic interneurons in the prefrontal cortex, suppressing GABAergic neurotransmission and enhancing excitatory transmission. Behavioral assays demonstrate YY-23’s rapid antidepressant effects in both stress-naïve and stress-exposed models, which are lost in mice with global or selective knockout of the grin2d gene in parvalbumin-positive interneurons.

Hyperammonemia also induced dysregulation of its main metabolic pathway, the urea cycle, as reflected by down-regulation of urea cycle enzyme protein expression and accumulation of its metabolites. Inhibition of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and its upstream inducer Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protected against liver injury and further hyperammonemia. In clinically relevant rodent models of hyperammonemia (genetic ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and bile duct ligation–induced cirrhosis), TLR4 inhibition reduced circulating ammonia. In conclusion, hyperammonemia induces liver fibrogenesis and RIPK1-mediated cell death, which is associated with urea cycle dysfunction.

  abstract     = {Extremely palatable food is pleasant and can cause prolonged consumption, which sometimes leads to overeating and obesity. The neural circuits underlying this eating behavior are poorly understood. Zhu et al . found that neurons projecting from a brain region surrounding the locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) mediated the increase of palatable food consumption (see the Perspective by Small). Temporally precise closed-loop VTA dopamine-releasing neuron modulation exclusively during consumption was critical for controlling this behavior. Activation of satiety pathways with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist suppressed VTA dopamine-releasing neuron responses during palatable food consumption. These findings reveal that VTA dopamine-releasing neurons encode palatability and control the consummatory phase of eating dependent on the specific timing of their activity. —Peter Stern Hedonic eating is defined as food consumption driven by palatability without physiological need. However, neural control of palatable food intake is poorly understood. We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by a neural pathway from the peri–locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTA DA ) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTA DA neuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTA DA neuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTA DA neuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTA DA neurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide.},

Owner behaviors such as limiting food access and providing physical activity can help mitigate the dogs’ risks, but genetic variants are also thought to play a role. Wallis et al . performed a genome-wide association study in hundreds of pet Labrador retrievers and identified the gene DENND1B as a major culprit in these dogs’ obesity. The authors demonstrated that DENND1B regulates the activity of the melanocortin 4 receptor, which plays a major role in energy homeostasis. They also identified a human patient with a mutation in DENND1B and other humans with additional mutations found in the dogs, demonstrating the connection to human physiology. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Obesity is a heritable disease, but its genetic basis is incompletely understood. Canine population history facilitates trait mapping. We performed a canine genome-wide association study for body condition score—a measure of obesity—in 241 Labrador retrievers. Using a cross-species approach, we showed that canine obesity genes are also associated with rare and common forms of obesity in humans. The lead canine association was within the gene DENN domain containing 1B ( DENND1B ). Each copy of the alternate allele was associated with ~7% greater body fat. We demonstrate a role for this gene in regulating signaling and trafficking of melanocortin 4 receptor, a critical controller of energy homeostasis.

  abstract     = {Beginning as early as 5000 years ago and lasting until just around 150 years ago, horses were integral to human societies. Their capacity for intense exertion led to their being used as everything from beasts of burden to elite racers. This athleticism is largely driven by increased oxygen consumption rates due to muscles full of mitochondria. Castiglione et al . found that horses evolved to cope with the increased oxidative burden brought about by mitochondrial activity through the evolution of a single point mutation that increases oxidative phosphorylation while simultaneously mitigating the consequent oxidative stress. —Sacha Vignieri Horses are among nature’s greatest athletes, yet the ancestral molecular adaptations fueling their energy demands are poorly understood. Within a clinically important pathway regulating redox and metabolic homeostasis (NRF2/KEAP1), we discovered an ancient mutation—conserved in all extant equids—that increases mitochondrial respiration while decreasing tissue-damaging oxidative stress. This mutation is a de novo premature opal stop codon in KEAP1 that is translationally recoded into a cysteine through previously unknown mechanisms, producing an R15C mutation in KEAP1 that is more sensitive to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. This recoding enables increased NRF2 activity, which enhances mitochondrial adenosine 5′-triphosphate production and cellular resistance to oxidative damage. Our study illustrates how recoding of a de novo stop codon, a strategy thought restricted to viruses, can facilitate adaptation in vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {Integral membrane proteins are essential for cell signaling, adhesion, migration, and nutrient uptake, and are ultimately degraded in catabolic organelles known as lysosomes. Breakdown of the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains of integral membrane proteins is especially challenging, and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Combining organelle proteomics, untargeted metabolomics, and reconstitution assays, Jain et al . identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP) as the protease responsible for degrading hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which has a high level of endocytosis. LyLAP ablation caused undigested hydrophobic domains to accumulate and led to lysosomal damage and PDA cell death, highlighting the critical role of this process under conditions of high membrane protein turnover. —Stella M. Hurtley Breakdown of every transmembrane protein trafficked to lysosomes requires proteolysis of their hydrophobic helical transmembrane domains. Combining lysosomal proteomics with functional genomic datasets, we identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP; formerly phospholipase B domain–containing 1) as the hydrolase most tightly associated with elevated endocytosis. Untargeted metabolomics and biochemical reconstitution demonstrated that LyLAP is a processive monoaminopeptidase with preference for amino-terminal leucine. This activity was necessary and sufficient for the breakdown of hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP was up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which relies on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. In PDA cells, LyLAP ablation led to the buildup of undigested hydrophobic peptides, lysosomal membrane damage, and growth inhibition. Thus, LyLAP enables lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins and protects lysosomal integrity in highly endocytic cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {Mammalian development is a complex and intricately organized process that we are just beginning to understand, in part because it requires coordinated interactions between many distinct cell types that change over time. To gain insight into this process, Li et al . developed sequencing methods for assessing chromatin accessibility in individual cells. They then applied these methods to mouse embryos at 10 distinct stages, ranging from the zygote to the late blastocyst, mapping key changes in chromatin state in different cell lineages over the course of these key stages in early development. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich In mammals, fertilized eggs undergo genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming to generate the organism. However, our understanding of epigenetic dynamics during preimplantation development at single-cell resolution remains incomplete. Here, we developed scNanoATAC-seq2, a single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using long-read sequencing for scarce samples. We present a detailed chromatin accessibility landscape of mouse preimplantation development, revealing distinct chromatin signatures in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm during lineage segregation. Differences between zygotes and two-cell embryos highlight reprogramming in chromatin accessibility during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Single-cell long-read sequencing enables in-depth analysis of chromatin accessibility in noncanonical imprinting, imprinted X chromosome inactivation, and low-mappability genomic regions, such as repetitive elements and paralogs. Our data provide insights into chromatin dynamics during mammalian preimplantation development and lineage differentiation.},

  abstract     = {Many bacteria maintain their genomic DNA as circular plasmids, but some species keep their chromosomes as linear molecules, similar to eukaryotes. The ends of linear chromosomes have adaptations called telomeres that are protected and maintained by enzymes. Hsieh et al . discovered a class of parasitic DNA elements called transposons that bias integration into chromosome ends. These telomeric transposons use special assembly and targeting mechanisms and have their own telomere maintenance systems that allow the element to control the chromosome end. These bacteria thus need to preserve the transposon, which ensures its survival and shapes how it exchanges genetic information. —Di Jiang Eukaryotes have linear DNA, and their telomeres are hotspots for transposons, which in some cases took over telomere maintenance. We identified several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . Although these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, substantially influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.},

Kim et al . reviewed recent developments in the field of complex frequency excitations in photonics and in other fields of physics governed by wave equations. In this excitation scheme, the signal pulses exponentially grow or decrease in amplitude over time. This dynamical behavior allows passive systems to mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to non-Hermitian responses without specific material modifications and leading to exotic optical effects. Applicable to wave systems in general, such complex excitations can be applied to developments in metamaterials, optical computing, sensing, and image processing. —Ian S. Osborne Closed, lossless optical cavities are characterized by a Hamiltonian that obeys Hermiticity, resulting in strictly real-valued resonance frequencies. By contrast, non-Hermitian wave systems are characterized by Hamiltonians with poles and zeros at complex frequencies, whose control through precise engineering of material loss and gain can lead to exotic scattering phenomena. Notably, excitation signals that oscillate at complex-valued frequencies can mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to these non-Hermitian responses without material modifications. These findings have been advancing the fundamental understanding of wave-matter interactions and are enabling breakthroughs in metamaterials, imaging, sensing, and computing. This Review examines theoretical advances and experimental discoveries in this emerging field, demonstrating how tailored time-domain excitations offer new opportunities for wave manipulation and control.},

To address this, research in quantum optics has explored filtering techniques such as photon ancillas and Rydberg atom blockade to restore entangled states. We introduce an approach to entanglement retrieval that exploits the features of non-Hermitian systems. By designing an anti–parity-time two-state guiding configuration, we demonstrate efficient extraction of entanglement from any input state. This filter is implemented on a lossless waveguide network and achieves near-unity fidelity under single- and two-photon excitation and is scalable to higher photon levels, remaining robust against decoherence during propagation.

In wheat and barley, an alternative class of genes called the tandem kinases also contribute to disease resistance. Two papers in this issue elucidate how tandem kinases work, showing that wheat tandem kinases require an NLR to function. Chen et al . found a pathogen effector that triggers the action of the wheat Sr62 tandem kinase. They demonstrate that the effector interacts with Sr62’s active kinase domain, enabling a pseudokinase domain to activate the corresponding NLR. In parallel, Lu et al . found that a different tandem kinase, WTK3, activates the same NLR as Sr62, and that this NLR acts as a calcium ion channel once activated. Together, these studies solidify the role of NLRs as hubs for immune signaling in response to diverse pathogens and will guide breeding efforts for disease-resistant wheat. —Madeleine Seale Tandem kinase proteins underlie the innate immune systems of cereal plants, but how they initiate plant immune responses remains unclear. This report identifies wheat protein wheat tandem NBD 1 (WTN1), a noncanonical nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor featuring tandem nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, plant R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domains, required for WTK3-mediated disease resistance. Both WTK3 and its allelic variant Rwt4—known for conferring resistance to wheat powdery mildew and blast, respectively—are capable of recognizing the blast effector PWT4. They activate WTN1 to form calcium-permeable channels, akin to ZAR1 and Sr35. Thus, tandem kinase proteins and their associated NLRs operate as “sensor-executor” pairs against fungal pathogens.

This mixture resulted in precipitates of nanoscale clusters of Cu 3 Li coated with Ta. This core-shell structure neither dissolves nor coarsens at temperatures of up to 800°C while also causing the yielding strength to be in excess of 1 gigapascal. —Marc S.

The thermal stability of the Cu-3Ta-0.5Li atomic % (at %) alloy is attributed to coherent, ordered L1 2 Cu 3 Li precipitates surrounded by a tantalum-rich atomic bilayer phase boundary complexion. Adding 0.5 at % lithium to the immiscible Cu-Ta system changes the morphology of the nanoscale precipitates from spherical to cuboidal while simultaneously tailoring the phase boundary.

During the interval from 2000 to 2002, terrestrial water storage decreased by nearly twice as much as Greenland ice mass loss over the same period. —Jesse Smith Rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures have caused substantial changes in terrestrial water circulation and land surface water fluxes, such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, potentially leading to abrupt shifts in terrestrial water storage.

During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland’s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002–2006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift (~45 centimeters).

Using high-frequency location data of rideshare drivers in Florida ( N = 222,838 individuals), we estimate the effect of driver race on citations and fines for speeding using 19.3 million location pings. Compared with a white driver traveling the same speed, we find that racial or ethnic minority drivers are 24 to 33% more likely to be cited for speeding and pay 23 to 34% more money in fines. We find no evidence that accident and reoffense rates explain these estimates, which suggests that an animus against minorities underlies our results.},

  abstract     = {Demography is critical for understanding how genetic variation has moved through time and space, and thus the selective and stochastic forces involved. However, these patterns are difficult to determine from modern genomes alone because different scenarios can result in similar genomic outcomes. Grundler et al . created a method using ancestral recombination graphs to trace the spatiotemporal history of DNA segments shared between modern humans (see the Perspective by Gravel). They predicted the least costly migration paths for their sampled individuals back through 200,000 years ago, showing that the most likely path out of Africa was the northern route. This method may prove useful in other species and could provide an alternate way to account for shared ancestry in genetic studies. —Corinne N. Simonti Describing the distribution of genetic variation across individuals is a fundamental goal of population genetics. We present a method that capitalizes on the rich genealogical information encoded in genomic tree sequences to infer the geographic locations of the shared ancestors of a sample of sequenced individuals. We used this method to infer the geographic history of genetic ancestry of a set of human genomes sampled from Europe, Asia, and Africa, accurately recovering major population movements on those continents. Our findings demonstrate the importance of defining the spatiotemporal context of genetic ancestry when describing human genetic variation and caution against the oversimplified interpretations of genetic data prevalent in contemporary discussions of race and ancestry.},

  abstract     = {Our sense of touch provides a wide range of sensations that tell us about the environment around us, including many things that we can’t ascertain using sight alone. These signals come from a rich collection of receptors that exist in the skin. Ha et al . developed a single actuator unit that can exert complex combinations of dynamic forces, including pressure, shear, vibration, displacement, and torque, to achieve haptic information transfer and realistic virtual tactile sensations. The authors demonstrate the application of this system in hand navigation, reproduction of textural sensation, and tactile perception of music, with a broader goal of using the actuator for biomedical and extended reality applications. —Marc S. Lavine The sense of touch conveys critical environmental information, facilitating object recognition, manipulation, and social interaction, and can be engineered through haptic actuators that stimulate cutaneous receptors. An unfulfilled challenge lies in haptic interface technologies that can engage all the various mechanoreceptors in a programmable, spatiotemporal fashion across large areas of the body. Here, we introduce a small-scale actuator technology that can impart omnidirectional, superimposable, dynamic forces to the surface of skin, as the basis for stimulating individual classes of mechanoreceptors or selected combinations of them. High-bit haptic information transfer and realistic virtual tactile sensations are possible, as illustrated through human subject perception studies in extended reality applications that include advanced hand navigation, realistic texture reproduction, and sensory substitution for music perception.},

Although palladium catalysis has been a workhorse for decades for this purpose, more Earth-abundant nickel catalysis has recently been used more often in tandem with chemical, photochemical, or electrochemical reductive activation. Sun et al . report the application of a class of sulfonyl hydrazide reactants that do not require external reduction. Simple heating with nickel catalysts forges a wide variety of carbon-carbon bonds to alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and aryl partners through a radical pathway. —Jake S. Yeston Sulfonyl hydrazides are stable and usually crystalline substances that can be accessed in a variety of ways, including transiently from hydrazones, to achieve a net reductive arylation of carbonyl compounds. We show their utility as versatile radical precursors, as exemplified with seven C–C bond–forming, redox-neutral cross-couplings with activated olefins, alkyl halides, redox-active esters, aryl halides, alkenyl halides, alkynyl halides, and a trifluoromethylating reagent, to forge C(sp 3 )-C(sp 3 ), C(sp 3 )-C(sp 2 ), and C(sp 3 )-C(sp) bonds. Exogenous redox (chemical, photo/electrochemical) additives are not necessary because these functional groups serve the dual role of radical precursor and electron donor. The homogeneous, water-compatible reaction conditions are operationally simple and contribute to streamlining synthesis and mild late-stage functionalization.},

This article begins by explaining how Chinese policy-makers have recently stepped up efforts to guide science in keeping with national priorities, including economic, environmental, and national security concerns. It then notes an important countercurrent, particularly the growing interest in “original innovation” and the appreciation that curiosity-driven research has a role to play in this regard. It concludes by noting that China is part of a broader international shift to leverage science for national purposes, and by highlighting the risks this trend entails.},

Similarly, particles in a quantum system are entangled to share some correlated feature even if they are far away. This phenomenon, called quantum entanglement ( 1 ), is important for quantum information processing but highly sensitive to decoherence (loss of quantum properties) ( 2 ). Exposure to uncontrolled environments, such as thermal fluctuations, causes entangled particles to pick up random noises, which leads to a so-called mixed state. Fortunately, there are ways to “filter” a mixed state back into a pure entangled state by engineering a quantum bath (or reservoir)—a controlled environment to which the system is coupled ( 3 , 4 ). On page 1424 of this issue, Selim et al.

One such behavior, called invigoration, causes an increase in speed, duration, and intake of a palatable food ( 1 ). The neural mechanisms underlying this behavior are not yet clear. On page 1376 of this issue, Zhu et al . ( 2 ) report a brain circuit that drives feeding invigoration in mice. This circuit begins with neurons in the area around the locus coeruleus (periLC) and results in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The finding provides a neural target, the therapeutic modulation of which might enable changes to food intake by preventing invigoration.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between atmospheric carbon levels and global temperature dates back to 1895, when Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius argued that variations in carbon dioxide concentrations could affect Earth’s heat budget. How climate warming affects Earth’s hydrological cycle—the continuous water movement between Earth and the atmosphere—is a key question for managing water resources and making weather predictions. Although local and regional changes in the water cycle have been observed ( 1 , 2 ), conclusive proof of a global-scale shift has been elusive. Answering this question requires decades of global mean sea level data and advanced climate and hydrological modeling. On page 1408 of this issue, Seo et al . ( 3 ) report how the integration of multiple global geophysical datasets reveals a permanent decline in terrestrial water storage. The study provides robust evidence of an irreversible shift in terrestrial water sources under the present changes in climate.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial cells often polarize along a tissue plane, a collective cell behavior known as planar cell polarity (PCP). To couple polarity between cells, asymmetrically localized PCP proteins bind intercellularly at cell junctions. Although PCP is by definition a multicellular process, the minimal number of cells required for PCP proteins to asymmetrically localize is not known. Basta et al . addressed this issue using chimeric mouse embryos in which dual-PCP reporter cells had been genetically uncoupled from their neighbors. They found that intercellular binding between just two cells was both necessary and sufficient to initiate the sorting of PCP complexes into asymmetric bridges. —Stella M. Hurtley For cells to polarize collectively along a tissue plane, asymmetrically localized planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes must form intercellular contacts between neighboring cells. Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.},

Long-term memory acquisition was found to be associated with a selective increase in multisynaptic boutons without the involvement of simultaneous activation of synaptically connected neurons. These results challenge the general applicability of the Hebbian model and expand our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for memory formation. —Mattia Maroso Memory engrams are formed through experience-dependent plasticity of neural circuits, but their detailed architectures remain unresolved. Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we performed nanoscale reconstructions of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway after chemogenetic labeling of cellular ensembles recruited during associative learning. Neurons with a remote history of activity coinciding with memory acquisition showed no strong preference for wiring with each other. Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes.

Two studies in this issue combine theory with existing data on multiple taxonomic groups to understand these relationships. Pigot et al . show that biomass generally increases with species richness because large-bodied species tend to be rare. Liang et al . show that ecosystem stability increases with area because of its relationship with biodiversity. Larger areas tend to have more species and more asynchrony between species, leading to greater stability. Together, these studies provide further insight into how biodiversity affects other ecosystem properties. —Bianca Lopez While both species richness and ecosystem stability increase with area, how these scaling patterns are linked remains unclear. Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.},

We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy.

This work has important implications for understanding how quickly carbon is returned to the atmosphere. —Jesse Smith Terrestrial sequestration of carbon has mitigated ≈30% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, its distribution across different pools, live or dead biomass and soil and sedimentary organic carbon, remains uncertain. Analyzing global observational datasets of changes in terrestrial carbon pools, we found that ≈35 ± 14 gigatons of carbon (GtC) have been sequestered on land between 1992 and 2019, whereas live biomass changed by ≈1 ± 7 GtC. Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills.},

However, it remains unclear whether high biodiversity in mountain ranges is an evolutionary response to the rate of relief generation during mountain building. Focusing on small mammals, such as rodents, we used coupled landscape-biological simulations to show that biodiversity increases with the magnitude and rate of tectonic uplift. This relationship, visible in depositional lowlands over millions of years, underscores the considerable role of mountain building in shaping past and present terrestrial biodiversity. Our results provide insights into the influence of topographic changes on evolutionary processes, offering a potential link between mountain formation and paleodiversity records.},

  abstract     = {Vascular plants regulate the flow of water and nutrients through their roots by creating a barrier in their extracellular space called the Casparian strip. Shen et al . identified genes involved in Casparian strip formation in Lotus japonicus , a legume that forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Furthermore, the authors established that mutants lacking a Casparian strip were less able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules, implying a connection between these processes. The presence of the Casparian strip also affected expression of the root-shoot signaling peptides that regulate nodulation. This work expands the role of the Casparian strip and links it to the spatial regulation of nodulation in plant roots. —Madeleine Seale Establishment of the apoplastic root barrier known as the Casparian strip occurs early in root development. In legumes, this area overlaps with nitrogen-fixing nodule formation, which raises the possibility that nodulation and barrier formation are connected. Nodules also contain Casparian strips, yet, in this case, their role is unknown. We established mutants with defective barriers in Lotus japonicus . This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation. Our findings further revealed that in nodules, the genetic machinery for Casparian strip formation is shared with roots. Apoplastic blockage controls the metabolic source-sink status required for nitrogen fixation. This identifies Casparian strips as a model system to study spatially constrained symbiotic plant-microbe relationships.},

  abstract     = {Marine mammals have adapted to an underwater environment and spend long periods of time underwater foraging despite the need for breathing air. As such, they are especially susceptible to low blood oxygen levels, which could lead to drowning while submerged. McKnight et al . exposed diving gray seals to various gas mixes and found that the seals responded to low levels of blood oxygen but not high levels of carbon dioxide (see the Perspective by Hawkes and Kendall-Bar). Nearly all other mammals are insensitive to blood oxygen levels, instead gauging blood oxygen by sensing increasing carbon dioxide. Direct sensing of oxygen levels likely improves diving efficiency. —Sacha Vignieri Marine mammals rely on maintaining sufficient blood oxygen levels while diving to prevent drowning. Generally, oxygen is cognitively imperceptible to mammals that instead sense rising carbon dioxide as a proxy for low oxygen. Not perceiving oxygen, however, is risky for diving mammals. We argue that any ability to alter dives based upon direct perception of oxygen should have been strongly selected for. We exposed diving seals to inhaled gas mixes that were experimentally altered to affect circulating levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Dive duration was positively correlated with circulating oxygen levels but unaffected by carbon dioxide levels and pH. These results suggest that seals do cognitively perceive circulating oxygen and use this to alter dive behavior.},

  abstract     = {The number of species in an ecosystem relates to several other key properties, including biomass and stability across time. Two studies in this issue combine theory with existing data on multiple taxonomic groups to understand these relationships. Pigot et al . show that biomass generally increases with species richness because large-bodied species tend to be rare. Liang et al . show that ecosystem stability increases with area because of its relationship with biodiversity. Larger areas tend to have more species and more asynchrony between species, leading to greater stability. Together, these studies provide further insight into how biodiversity affects other ecosystem properties. —Bianca Lopez Despite advances in theory and experiments, how biodiversity influences the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems remains debated. By applying new theory to data on 84,695 plant, animal, and protist assemblages, we show that the general positive effect of species richness on stocks of biomass, as well as much of the variation in the strength and sign of this effect, is predicted by a fundamental macroecological quantity: the scaling of species abundance with body mass. Standing biomass increases with richness when large-bodied species are numerically rare but is independent of richness when species size and abundance are uncoupled. These results suggest a new fundamental law in the structure of ecological communities and show that the impacts of changes in species richness on biomass are predictable.},

This seemingly simple question has been difficult to answer given the technical challenges of studying the infant brain. On page 1316 of this issue, Yates et al . ( 2 ) provide functional neuroimaging evidence that the infant hippocampus (a brain region important for memory) can encode the types of information that are required for episodic memory, that is, memories for specific life events containing information about people, places, and things.

  abstract     = {Trypanosomatids are parasites transmitted by insects that cause lethal and debilitating diseases in humans and other vertebrates. These parasites depend on a tail-like oscillating appendage called a flagellum to travel within their insect carriers or vertebrate hosts. The movement of the flagellum is generated by an enormous internal protein-based machine called the axoneme. Xia et al . used high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy to reveal the intricate structure and connections of the flagellum components of Trypanosoma brucei . They identified components specific to the parasite and uncovered how molecular motors drive the movement. Doran et al . defined individual components of the axoneme and identified a cluster of proteins that are essential for the parasite’s ability to swim properly. Together, these studies shed light on flagellum biology, evolution, and function; enhance our understanding of parasite biology; and highlight potential drug targets to prevent parasite spread and infection. —Stella M. Hurtley The movement and pathogenicity of trypanosomatid species, the causative agents of trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, are dependent on a flagellum that contains an axoneme of dynein-bound doublet microtubules (DMTs). In this work, we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of DMTs from two trypanosomatid species, Leishmania tarentolae and Crithidia fasciculata , at resolutions up to 2.7 angstrom. The structures revealed 27 trypanosomatid-specific microtubule inner proteins, a specialized dynein-docking complex, and the presence of paralogous proteins that enable higher-order periodicities or proximal-distal patterning. Leveraging the genetic tractability of trypanosomatid species, we quantified the location and contribution of each structure-identified protein to swimming behavior. Our study shows that proper B-tubule closure is critical for flagellar motility, exemplifying how integrating structural identification with systematic gene deletion can dissect individual protein contributions to flagellar motility.},

However, the molecular details of this process remain unclear. Here, we present high-resolution (up to 2.8 angstrom) cryo–electron microscopy structures of T. brucei flagellar doublet microtubules (DMTs). Integrated modeling identified 154 different axonemal proteins inside and outside the DMT and, together with genetic and proteomic interrogation, revealed conserved and trypanosome-specific foundations of flagellum assembly and motility. We captured axonemal dynein motors in their pre–power stroke state. Comparing atomic models between pre– and post–power strokes defined how dynein structural changes drive sliding of adjacent DMTs during flagellar beating. This study illuminates structural dynamics underlying flagellar motility and identifies pathogen-specific proteins to consider for therapeutic interventions targeting neglected diseases.},

Koundouros et al . report a mechanism by which linoleic acid can activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase, which coordinates growth and nutrient signals (see the Perspective by Jacinto). Particularly in certain breast cancer cells that overexpressed fatty acid binding protein 5, mTORC1 was activated by linoleic acid, and this action appeared to be mediated by direct binding of this protein to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR. —L. Bryan Ray Diet influences macronutrient availability to cells, and although mechanisms of sensing dietary glucose and amino acids are well characterized, less is known about sensing lipids. We defined a nutrient signaling mechanism involving fatty acid–binding protein 5 (FABP5) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) that is activated by the essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ω-6 linoleic acid (LA). FABP5 directly bound to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) to enhance formation of functional mTORC1 and substrate binding, ultimately converging on increased mTOR signaling and proliferation. The amounts of FABP5 protein were increased in tumors and serum from triple-negative compared with those from receptor-positive breast cancer patients, which highlights its potential role as a biomarker that mediates cellular responses to ω-6 LA intake in this disease subtype.},

Miao et al . discovered that despite this physical separation, the two cell types communicate with each other through tiny structures called tunneling nanotube-like microstructures (TNTLs) (see the Perspective by de la Pompa). TNTLs extend across the cardiac jelly, allowing direct cell-cell contact, signal transduction, and selective protein transfer. Disrupting TNTLs leads to abnormal heart wall formation, highlighting the importance of TNTLs in cardiac development. —Stella M. Hurtley In the developing mammalian heart, the endocardium and the myocardium are separated by so-called cardiac jelly. Communication between the endocardium and the myocardium is essential for cardiac morphogenesis. How membrane-localized receptors and ligands achieve interaction across the cardiac jelly is not understood. Working in developing mouse cardiac morphogenesis models, we used a variety of cellular, imaging, and genetic approaches to elucidate this question. We found that myocardium and endocardium interacted directly through microstructures termed tunneling nanotube–like structures (TNTLs). TNTLs extended from cardiomyocytes (CMs) to contact endocardial cells (ECs) directly. TNTLs transported cytoplasmic proteins, transduced signals between CMs and ECs, and initiated myocardial growth toward the heart lumen to form ventricular trabeculae-like structures. Loss of TNTLs disturbed signaling interactions and, subsequently, ventricular patterning.},

However, fundamental mechanical properties, such as the ice flow law and viscosity structure, remain under debate. In this work, by leveraging remote-sensing data and physics-informed deep learning, we provide evidence over several ice shelves that the flow law follows a grain size–sensitive composite rheology in the compression zone. In the extension zone, we found that ice exhibits anisotropic properties. We constructed ice shelf–wide anisotropic viscosity maps that capture the suture zones, which inhibit rift propagation. The inferred stress exponent near the grounding zone dictates the grounding-line ice flux and grounding line stability, whereas the inferred viscosity maps inform the prediction of rifts.

However, large amounts of water are required for mining and processing, which could limit mineral production in some locations. Islam et al . evaluated these constraints using published data on mineral production and water requirements for different minerals, coupled with regional water-carrying capacities from a hydrologic model. They found that mineral production exceeds water resources in many regions because of high production or low water availability. Coal, iron, copper, and gold showed some of the highest overconsumption, coal because of its high production rates and the metals because they require more water to process. Water requirements for mineral production are expected to increase in the future. —Bianca Lopez Although the global economy requires geological resource mining, production has substantial environmental impacts, including the use of regional available water. In this study, we shed light on the global production capacity of 32 mined geological resources, considering regional water availability as a constraint. We found that current resource mining greatly exceeds regional water constraints for several, notably copper (37% of current production exceeds available water capacity) in 2010. Changing the location of production to regions of lower water stress would alleviate current exceedances of water constraints; however, considering economic factors shows that this is not always feasible. Future demand for geological resources is expected to require a considerable increase in water consumption. Considering the constraints of water resources in geological resource production is crucial for sustainability.},

Smith Interstellar dust grains cause extinction (absorption and scattering) of light from background astronomical sources. The spectral shape of the extinction curve depends on the dust composition. We used low-resolution optical spectra to measure the extinction curve of 130 million stars. By inverting these data, we mapped the extinction curve parameter R ( V ) within the Milky Way in three dimensions and within the Magellanic Clouds in two dimensions. These maps provide improved extinction corrections for astronomical observations. We find that R ( V ) varies with extinction, consistent with dust grains growing by accretion in low-extinction regions and by coagulation in higher-extinction regions. Star-forming regions have high R ( V ) values, indicating either preferential destruction of small dust grains or additional supply of large dust grains in those regions.},

They found that production rates are proportional to radiation flux and estimate that this pathway creates more N 2 O than biological production in surface waters, thus constituting a major source of N 2 O emissions globally. —Jesse Smith Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a potent greenhouse gas and the main stratospheric ozone-depleting agent, yet its sources are not well resolved. In this work, we experimentally show a N 2 O production pathway not previously considered in greenhouse gas budgets, which we name photochemodenitrification. Sunlight induces substantial and consistent N 2 O production under oxic abiotic conditions in fresh and marine waters. We measured photochemical N 2 O production rates using isotope tracers and determined that nitrite is the main substrate and that nitrate can also contribute after being photoreduced to nitrite. Additionally, this N 2 O production was strongly correlated to the radiation dose. Photochemodenitrification exceeded biological N 2 O production in surface waters.

Less work has been done to explore the coloration of early mammals. Li et al . looked at melanosome patterns in multiple species of Mesozoic mammals and compared these with those seen in more than 100 species of extant mammals. There was little color variation, and the animals were entirely dark in color. The authors argue that this was likely due to the animals’ nocturnal nature, and that brighter and more varied colors in mammals may have arisen after the extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period. —Sacha Vignieri Pelage coloration, which serves numerous functions, is crucial to the evolution of behavior, physiology, and habitat preferences of mammals. However, little is known about the coloration of Mesozoic mammaliaforms that coevolved with dinosaurs. In this study, we used a dataset of melanosome (melanin-containing organelle) morphology and quantitatively measured hair colors from 116 extant mammals to reliably reconstruct the coloration of six Mesozoic mammaliaforms, including a previously undescribed euharamiyidan. Unlike the highly diverse melanosomes discovered in feathered dinosaurs, hairs in six mammaliaforms of different lineages and diverse ecomorphotypes showed uniform melanosome geometry, corresponding to dark-brown coloration consistent with crypsis and nocturnality. Our results suggest that the melanosome variation and color expansion seen in extant mammals may have occurred during their rapid radiation and diversification after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.},

They found at least three lead-free compositions with good piezoelectric strain coefficients, even at high temperatures.

We report the observation of the piezoelectric (PE) effect in half-Heusler (HH) narrow-bandgap semiconductors TiNiSn, ZrNiSn, and TiCoSb. These materials exhibit shear PE strain coefficients that reach ~38 and 33 picocoulombs per newton in ZrNiSn and TiCoSb, respectively, which are high values for noncentrosymmetric nonpolar materials. We demonstrated a TiCoSb-based PE sensor with a large voltage response and capable of charging a capacitor. The PE effect in HHs remains thermally stable up to 1173 kelvin, underscoring their potential for high-temperature applications.

  abstract     = {Along with the enormous costs to human life and livelihoods, war creates environmental catastrophes. In the ongoing war in Ukraine, dams have been the targets of military attacks, creating floods and severely diminishing water resources for agricultural irrigation. Shumilova et al . measured and modeled some of the less well-recognized environmental impacts of dam destruction, focusing on the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine. The destruction of the dam in June 2023 released pollutants that had accumulated in the reservoir sediments, creating a long-term source of contaminants that could be spread by future floods. Fast-growing riparian vegetation could help recover the floodplain of the former lake bed in the short term, but actions must be taken to address contamination in the region. —Bianca Lopez The use of water as a weapon in highly industrialized areas in the Russo-Ukrainian war has resulted in catastrophic economic and environmental damages. We analyze environmental effects caused by the military destruction of the Kakhovka Dam. We link field, remote sensing, and modeling data to demarcate the disaster’s spatial-temporal scales and outline trends in reestablishment of damaged ecosystems. Although media attention has focused on the immediate impacts of flooding on society, politics, and the economy, our results show that toxic contamination within newly exposed sediments of the former reservoir bed poses a largely overlooked long-term threat to freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. The continued use of water as a weapon may lead to even greater risks for people and the environment.},

  abstract     = {There is considerable interest in engineering chirality into semiconductor materials, with the goal of achieving high levels of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Currently, efficient organic light-emitting diode (OLED) systems use light-emitting molecules spatially isolated in a host, resulting in low levels of CPL. Previous attempts to build uniform chiral supramolecular order have not been compatible with optimized OLED device architectures. Chowdhury et al . found a way to fabricate thin, uniform films with chiral supramolecular nanostructures based on triazatruxene molecules. The method is fully compatible with OLED fabrication and demonstrated strong green CPL. This work opens new avenues for development in organic electronics driven by circularly polarized light. —Yury Suleymanov Current organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology uses light-emitting molecules in a molecular host. We report green circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in a chirally ordered supramolecular assembly, with 24% dissymmetry in a triazatruxene (TAT) system. We found that TAT assembled into helices with a pitch of six molecules, associating angular momentum to the valence and conduction bands and obtaining the observed CPL. Cosublimation of TAT as the “guest” in a structurally mismatched “host” enabled fabrication of thin films in which chiral crystallization was achieved in situ by thermally triggered nanophase segregation of dopant and host while preserving film integrity. The OLEDs showed external quantum efficiencies of up to 16% and electroluminescence dissymmetries ≥10%. Vacuum deposition of chiral superstructures opens new opportunities to explore chiral-driven optical and transport phenomena.},

  abstract     = {One of the defining characteristics of aryl compounds such as benzene is their greater stability compared with other arrangements of carbon-carbon double bonds. If one of the aryl bonds is broken, those remaining tend to be more reactive. Olivier et al . report a reaction manifold that reverses this prevailing trend. A nitroarene reagent can be photoexcited to a state that preferentially reacts with arenes over olefins, likely through transient complexation, thereby enabling clean oxidative cleavage of just one aryl bond. —Jake S. Yeston The ozonolytic deconstruction of aromatics remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes.},

There have also been extensive conversations about cultural and social consequences of large models, orbiting around two foci: immediate effects of these systems as they are currently used, and hypothetical futures when these systems turn into AGI agents—perhaps even superintelligent AGI agents. But this discourse about large models as intelligent agents is fundamentally misconceived. Combining ideas from social and behavioral sciences with computer science can help us to understand AI systems more accurately.

The process begins with the formation of the heart tube, which consists of an inner endothelial lining (endocardium) and a layer of muscle cells (myocardium), separated by a thick extracellular matrix called the cardiac jelly. Subsequent development of the heart ventricles involves the formation of trabeculae—muscular ridges lined by the endocardium. How signals pass between the endocardium and myocardium across the cardiac jelly to ensure normal development is not fully understood. On page 1166 of this issue, Miao et al . ( 1 ) report that, in mice, the myocardium and endocardium of the early heart tube communicate directly through tiny membrane-enclosed projections called tunneling nanotube–like structures (TNTLs).

A key component of this machinery is the enzyme mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR partners with other proteins to form two distinct complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) that regulate various aspects of anabolic metabolism ( 1 ). Yet, how mTORCs sense nutrients, particularly lipids or fats, remains largely unexplored. On page 1164 of this issue, Koundouros et al .

  abstract     = {Naturally occurring obstacles in chromosomal DNA can challenge the faithful propagation of the genome across generations. Batra et al . determined that noncanonical DNA secondary structures called G-quadruplexes can impede DNA copying by arresting the replicative DNA helicase known as CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS), which serves as the central engine of the molecular machinery that copies chromosomal DNA. The CMG helicase moves along DNA through a previously unrecognized inchworm-like mechanism. These observations uncover fundamental principles of the chromosome replication process that are essential for the maintenance of genome stability. —Di Jiang DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non–B-form DNA secondary structures that threaten genome stability by impeding DNA replication. To elucidate how G4s induce replication fork arrest, we characterized fork collisions with preformed G4s in the parental DNA using reconstituted yeast and human replisomes. We demonstrate that a single G4 in the leading strand template is sufficient to stall replisomes by arresting the CMG helicase. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of stalled yeast and human CMG complexes reveal that the folded G4 is lodged inside the central CMG channel, arresting translocation. The G4 stabilizes the CMG at distinct translocation intermediates, suggesting an unprecedented helical inchworm mechanism for DNA translocation. These findings illuminate the eukaryotic replication fork mechanism under normal and perturbed conditions.},

Wei et al . found that that severe COVID-19 can disrupt peroxisomes in macrophages, an immune cell type specialized in engulfing cellular debris and pathogens. This disruption led to impaired lung repair, prolonged inflammation, and chronic fibrosis (see the Perspective by Sariol and Perlman). In mouse models, enhancing peroxisome function using an FDA-approved drug improved lung healing and reduced long-term damage after viral infection. Thus, targeting peroxisomes could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing acute and chronic complications caused by respiratory viruses. —Stella M. Hurtley Peroxisomes are vital but often overlooked metabolic organelles. We found that excessive interferon signaling remodeled macrophage peroxisomes. This loss of peroxisomes impaired inflammation resolution and lung repair during severe respiratory viral infections. Peroxisomes were found to modulate lipid metabolism and mitochondrial health in a macrophage type-specific manner and enhanced alveolar macrophage-mediated tissue repair and alveolar regeneration after viral infection. Peroxisomes also prevented excessive macrophage inflammasome activation and IL-1β release, limiting accumulation of KRT8 high dysplastic epithelial progenitors following viral injury. Pharmacologically enhancing peroxisome biogenesis mitigated both acute symptoms and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in animal models.

Kistler et al . sequenced the genomes of 200 herbarium samples, two archeological samples, and 80 modern samples of manioc to reconstruct its population history. Their analysis revealed that many lineages of manioc have been propagating for at least a century but with almost no geographical patterns of variation like their wild relatives. These patterns instead reflected local agricultural practices. By incorporating Indigenous knowledge, this study explores the impact of domestication on this crop and how this process is reflected in genetic variation. —Corinne Simonti Manioc—also called cassava and yuca—is among the world’s most important crops, originating in South America in the early Holocene. Domestication for its starchy roots involved a near-total shift from sexual to clonal propagation, and almost all manioc worldwide is now grown from stem cuttings. In this work, we analyze 573 new and published genomes, focusing on traditional varieties from the Americas and wild relatives from herbaria, to reveal the effects of this shift to clonality. We observe kinship over large distances, maintenance of high genetic diversity, intergenerational heterozygosity enrichment, and genomic mosaics of identity-by-descent haploblocks that connect all manioc worldwide. Interviews with Indigenous traditional farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado illuminate how traditional management strategies for sustaining, diversifying, and sharing the gene pool have shaped manioc diversity.},

Although they are essential for this decoding process, they are often viewed as identical particles with little regulatory influence. Zhang et al . developed techniques to observe single ribosomes and examine their composition in different cellular compartments. They found that a protein called Lsg1 is involved in recruiting ribosomes near the endoplasmic reticulum to produce membrane-embedded proteins. They also found specialized ribosomes near mitochondria for making metabolism-related proteins and remodeling of ribosomal populations in neuronal processes, revealing a new layer of gene control based on ribosome type and location. —Di Jiang Millions of ribosomes are packed within mammalian cells, yet we lack tools to visualize them in toto and characterize their subcellular composition. In this study, we present ribosome expansion microscopy (RiboExM) to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique (ALIBi) to probe their composition. We generated a super-resolution ribosomal map, revealing subcellular translational hotspots and enrichment of 60 S subunits near polysomes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that Lsg1 tethers 60 S to the ER and regulates translation of select proteins. Additionally, we discovered ribosome heterogeneity at mitochondria guiding translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Lastly, we visualized ribosomes in neurons, revealing a dynamic switch between monosomes and polysomes in neuronal translation.

  abstract     = {In model animals, products from the gut microbiota have been identified that influence host cell function. For example, a bacterial protein has been found that promotes beta cell proliferation in the islets of the pancreas of zebrafish. Hill et al . found that neonatal mice must be exposed to a microbiota during a particular developmental window to be able to develop functional pancreatic beta cells and islets. The fungal species Candida dubliniensis mediates this effect through islet macrophages, possible through fungal cell wall components. If the developmental window is missed (e.g., in germ-free mice) or if the microbiota are disrupted during the developmental window, there is reduced beta cell development and compromised metabolic function reverberates throughout the life of the animal. —Caroline Ash Loss of early-life microbial diversity is correlated with diabetes, yet mechanisms by which microbes influence disease remain elusive. We report a critical neonatal window in mice when microbiota disruption results in lifelong metabolic consequences stemming from reduced β cell development. We show evidence for the existence of a similar program in humans and identify specific fungi and bacteria that are sufficient for β cell growth. The microbiota also plays an important role in seeding islet-resident macrophages, and macrophage depletion during development reduces β cells. Candida dubliniensis increases β cells in a macrophage-dependent manner through distinctive cell wall composition and reduces murine diabetes incidence. Provision of C. dubliniensis after β cell ablation or antibiotic treatment improves β cell function. These data identify fungi as critical early-life commensals that promote long-term metabolic health.},

Two papers in this issue assess the degree to which plant species are tracking climate change in the American tropics, where data availability has constrained inference. Ramírez-Barahona et al . show that in Mesoamerican cloud forests, climate change and deforestation together have led to a mean upward shift in species ranges since 1979, mainly due to contracting lower range edges. In tropical forests across the Americas, Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al . found that tree traits are not shifting fast enough to track climate change based on trait-climate relationships, with smaller shifts in montane forests. —Bianca Lopez Understanding the capacity of forests to adapt to climate change is of pivotal importance for conservation science, yet this is still widely unknown. This knowledge gap is particularly acute in high-biodiversity tropical forests. Here, we examined how tropical forests of the Americas have shifted community trait composition in recent decades as a response to changes in climate. Based on historical trait-climate relationships, we found that, overall, the studied functional traits show shifts of less than 8% of what would be expected given the observed changes in climate. However, the recruit assemblage shows shifts of 21% relative to climate change expectation. The most diverse forests on Earth are changing in functional trait composition but at a rate that is fundamentally insufficient to track climate change.},

Here, we report the direct insertion of a nitrogen atom into unactivated carbon-carbon double bonds to access aza-allenium intermediates, which can be converted either into nitriles or amidine products, depending on the initial alkene substitution pattern. This operationally simple and highly functionally compatible reaction works on a wide range of unactivated alkenes. PIFA, a commercially available and inexpensive hypervalent iodine reagent, is key to this reactivity. Our mechanistic proposal is supported by chemical trapping experiments, which concomitantly demonstrate the utility of our method to access valuable N -heterocycles. Additionally, our method can be used as a general strategy for synthesizing amides and amines, as well as 15 N-labeled molecules.},

  abstract     = {Twisting and coiling polymer fibers has proven to be a simple method to create artificial muscles. Previous approaches have either used a self-coiling method, which is limited to muscles with a low spring index, or involve wrapping the fibers around a mandrel, which allows for high–spring index yarns, but the mandrel then needs to be extracted, generating excess waste. Zhang et al . managed to get rid of the mandrel by developing a process in which fibers are first twisted and then plied with other twisted fibers (see the Perspective by Zhang). After thermal stabilization, they are separated to produce coils from the original fibers. This process makes it possible to vary the spring index along the length of the fiber. The authors demonstrate the use of these polymer muscles for environmentally driven tunable insulation and in robotics through electrically driven actuation. —Marc S. Lavine Methods for making high-spring-index polymer fiber or yarn muscles have required expensive fabrication by wrapping around a mandrel, which limits their practical applications. We demonstrate an inexpensive mandrel-free method for making polymer muscles that can have a spring index of &gt;50 and a contractile tensile stroke exceeding 97%. This method enables the spring index to be varied along a muscle’s length by varying the plying twist, resulting in muscles that transition between homochiral and heterochiral when either heated or cooled. We demonstrate use of these polymer muscles for robots and environmentally driven comfort-adjusting jackets. This mandrel-free method was used to make high-spring-index carbon nanotube yarns for mechanical energy harvesters, self-powered strain sensors, and solvent-driven and electrochemically driven artificial muscles.},

  abstract     = {Reports of declining insect populations have received widespread media attention, but evidence for declines has been variable across regions and taxonomic groups. Edwards et al . examined trends in the most surveyed taxon: butterflies (see the Perspective by Inouye). Combining data from 35 citizen science programs across the continental US, the authors found declines in overall butterfly abundance over the past 20 years across almost all major regions. Two-thirds of studied species showed declines of more than 10%. Many insects have the potential for rapid population growth and recovery, but habitat restoration, species-specific interventions, and reducing pesticide use are all likely needed to curb population declines. —Bianca Lopez Numerous declines have been documented across insect groups, and the potential consequences of insect losses are dire. Butterflies are the most surveyed insect taxa, yet analyses have been limited in geographic scale or rely on data from a single monitoring program. Using records of 12.6 million individual butterflies from &gt;76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programs, we characterized overall and species-specific butterfly abundance trends across the contiguous United States. Between 2000 and 2020, total butterfly abundance fell by 22% across the 554 recorded species. Species-level declines were widespread, with 13 times as many species declining as increasing. The prevalence of declines throughout all regions in the United States highlights an urgent need to protect butterflies from further losses.},

  abstract     = {Carbon-nitrogen bonds are cornerstones of modern pharmaceuticals, and chemists continually strive to find more efficient ways to make them. Two studies now report distinct methods of cleaving carbon-carbon double bonds and forming carbon-nitrogen triple bonds in their place. Brägger et al . used a hypervalent iodine reagent to produce the nitrile products, whereas Cheng et al . used a heterogeneous copper catalyst in conjunction with oxygen. In both cases, the carbon-carbon double bonds served as convenient handles for the transformation of a wide variety of complex molecules. —Jake S. Yeston Deconstructive transformation of carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) is a pivotal strategy in synthetic chemistry and drug discovery. Despite the substantial advances in olefin metathesis and ozonolysis for natural product synthesis through C=C double-bond cleavage, the catalytic remodeling of complex molecules through C=C double-bond deconstruction has been underdeveloped. We report a heterogeneous copper-catalyzed C=C double-bond cleavage, which enables the remodeling of complex molecules by converting the carbons on either side of the C=C double bond to carbonyl and cyano groups, respectively. In particular, this method provides an efficient protocol to conveniently transform terpenoids, glycals, steroids, and bioactive molecules to privileged scaffolds with underexplored chemical space.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a cutting-edge technique that can manipulate tunneling electrons on subpicosecond timescales using an electric field generated by a THz pulse. THz-STM has been used in recent years to study ultrafast nanometer-scale dynamics induced by charge transfer on solid surfaces. However, there are still many challenges in improving spatiotemporal resolution. Kimura et al . successfully demonstrated ultrafast manipulation of exciton formation in a single phthalocyanine molecule on a metal-supported ultrathin insulating film by tailoring the waveform of THz pulses. The presented experimental platform is a promising step in studying exciton dynamics with single-molecule precision. —Yury Suleymanov The ultrafast manipulation of molecular states by charge transfer is essential for characterizing and controlling molecular dynamics. In this study, we demonstrated exciton formation in a single molecule through ultrafast electron tunneling processes between a molecule and a metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) using a phase-controlled terahertz (THz) pulse. The pronounced luminescence of the well-defined molecular system under the distinct carrier-envelope phase of the THz pulse revealed that sequential state-selective electron-tunneling processes to the frontier molecular orbitals promoted ultrafast exciton formation in the molecule at the STM junction. Furthermore, ultrafast control of exciton formation was achieved using phase- and delay-controlled THz pulse pairs, providing a route for the regulation of molecular dynamics and the emergence of new molecular functions.},

We mechanically reinforced perovskite thin films by integrating a polymer-coupled monolithic single-layer graphene interface that led to a twofold enhancement in modulus and hardness. The synergistic effect of graphene and poly(methyl methacrylate) restricted photoinduced lattice expansion and decreased the deformation ratio from 0.31 to 0.08%, which minimized the structural damage caused by dynamic lattice evolution.

  abstract     = {Proteins are translated from messenger RNA (mRNA), and the levels of these biomolecules are often correlated for a given gene. However, this observation is at odds with the fact that many variants that alter gene expression do not alter protein levels. Cope et al . tested several phylogenetic models relating mRNA and protein levels in coupled transcriptomic and proteomic data from skin samples across 10 mammals. They found that evolution primarily acting on protein levels best fit the data, with gene expression driven to accommodate those optimal levels. These mRNA values did not match perfectly and are likely amplified due to post-transcriptional mechanisms such as translational efficiency or protein degradation. —Corinne Simonti The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundances is well-studied, but less is known about the evolutionary processes shaping their relationship. To address this, we derived a new phylogenetic model and applied it to multispecies mammalian data. Our analyses reveal (i) strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances over macroevolutionary time, (ii) mutations affecting mRNA abundances minimally impact protein abundances, (iii) mRNA abundances evolve under selection to align with protein abundances, and (iv) mRNA abundances adapt faster than protein abundances owing to greater mutational opportunity. These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression.},

Two papers in this issue assess the degree to which plant species are tracking climate change in the American tropics, where data availability has constrained inference. Ramírez-Barahona et al . show that in Mesoamerican cloud forests, climate change and deforestation together have led to a mean upward shift in species ranges since 1979, mainly due to contracting lower range edges. In tropical forests across the Americas, Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al . found that tree traits are not shifting fast enough to track climate change based on trait-climate relationships, with smaller shifts in montane forests. —Bianca Lopez Global change drives biodiversity shifts worldwide, but these shifts are poorly understood in highly diverse tropical regions. In tropical mountains, plants are mostly expected to migrate upslope in response to warming. To assess this, we analyze shifts in elevation ranges of species in Mesoamerican cloud forests using three decades of species’ occurrence records. Our findings reveal a mean upslope shift of 1.8 to 2.7 meters per year since 1979 driven by the upslope retreat of the less thermophilic montane species. These shifts are mostly accompanied by retreating lower and upper edges attributed to varying degrees of species’ exposure to deforestation and climate change. Our results highlight the vulnerability of cloud forests under global change and the urgency to increase monitoring of species’ responses.},

  abstract     = {A group of mineral compounds with a distinct crystalline structure, called perovskite, is a cost-effective alternative to conventional semiconductors. Solar cells based on perovskites continue to set new performance standards in sunlight-to-electricity conversion, achieving efficiencies that are comparable to those of established materials such as silicon ( 1 ). Perovskites in tandem with silicon have also shown higher power conversion efficiencies than that of a single material ( 2 ). However, long-term stability of perovskite solar cells remains a major hurdle because of the compounds’ sensitivity to factors such as heat and light-induced stress. On page 1069 of this issue, Li et al. ( 3 ) report that layers of graphene and polymer reinforce a perovskite film to reduce lightinduced structural distortion substantially. This, in addition to a recent study of Zai et al. ( 4 ) that reported perovskite stabilization with molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), shows how two-dimensional (2D) materials could move perovskite-based devices toward practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Although great strides have been made in understanding and mitigating acute manifestations of COVID-19, post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) or “Long Covid”—which includes long-term lung, neurological, and cardiovascular complications—remains a substantial burden to patients and the health care system. The mechanisms that underlie PASC are not clear, but aberrant immune responses have been implicated. On page 1054 of this issue, Wei et al . ( 1 ) report dysfunction in alveolar macrophages—lung-resident immune cells involved in tissue repair—as a contributing factor to persistent lung pathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Loss of peroxisomes (organelles involved in oxidative reactions and metabolism) from these macrophages after infection in mice ( Mus musculus ) resulted in impaired regeneration of lung tissue and persistent fibrosis—scar tissue harmful to lung function. These findings elucidate the etiology of postviral lung disease and suggest avenues for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract     = {Humans rely on muscle coordination for essential functions such as movement, regulation of blood flow, and respiration. For a synthetic material to mimic biological muscle properties, it needs to generate sufficient mechanical force and deform across large lengths in response to external stimuli. A promising type of artificial muscle, called “coiled muscle,” has a substantial actuation range and power when heated. Constructed by coiling a twisted fiber often made of polymers, its functionality is determined by the spring index, which is the ratio of coil diameter to fiber diameter ( 1 ). Various synthetic materials with high spring indices have been developed ( 2 , 3 ), but these often require expensive fabrication methods. On page 1101 of this issue, Zhang et al. ( 4 ) report that simple plying of two or more twisted fibers produces a coiled muscle with a high spring index. This approach could lead to a cost-effective way to create artificial muscles at a large scale.},

  abstract     = {Torque and continuous rotation are fundamental methods of actuation and manipulation in rigid robots. Soft robot arms use soft materials and structures to mimic the passive compliance of biological arms that bend and extend. This use of compliance prevents soft arms from continuously transmitting and exerting torques to interact with their environment. Here, we show how relying on patterning structures instead of inherent material properties allows soft robotic arms to remain compliant while continuously transmitting torque to their environment. We demonstrate a soft robotic arm made from a pair of mechanical metamaterials that act as compliant constant-velocity joints. The joints are up to 52 times stiffer in torsion than bending and can bend up to 45°. This robot arm continuously transmits torque while remaining flexible in all other directions. The arm’s mechanical design achieves high motion repeatability (0.4 millimeters and 0.1°) when tracking trajectories. We then trained a neural network to learn the inverse kinematics, enabling us to program the arm to complete tasks that are challenging for existing soft robots, such as installing light bulbs, fastening bolts, and turning valves. The arm’s passive compliance makes it safe around humans and provides a source of mechanical intelligence, enabling it to adapt to misalignment when manipulating objects. This work will bridge the gap between hard and soft robotics with applications in human assistance, warehouse automation, and extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic fields enable remote manipulation of objects and are ideal for medical applications because they pass through human tissue harmlessly. This capability is promising for surgical robots, allowing navigation deeper into the human anatomy and accessing organs beyond the reach of current technologies. However, magnetic manipulation is typically limited to a maximum two–degrees-of-freedom orientation, restricting complex motions, especially those including rolling around the main axis of the magnetic robot. To address this challenge, we introduce a robot design inspired by embodied intelligence and the unique geometry of developable rollers, leveraging the oloid shape. The oloid, with its axial asymmetry and sinusoidal motion, facilitates rolling when precisely controlled by an external magnetic field. We present a versatile closed-loop control model to ensure precise magnetic manipulation of an oloid-shaped robot. This capability was validated in endoluminal applications through the integration of a 28-megahertz micro-ultrasound array to perform virtual biopsies, noninvasive real-time histological imaging. Extensive in vitro and in vivo tests using a porcine model showed the robot’s ability to execute sweeping motions, identify lesions, and generate detailed three-dimensional scans of gastrointestinal subsurface tissue. This research not only restores a critical movement capability to magnetic medical robots but also enables additional clinical applications deep within the human body.},

  abstract     = {Locomotors traversing arboreal environments must often leap across large gaps to land on small-diameter supports. Balancing these dynamic landings is challenging because of high incident momentum, restricted foothold options, and reduced capacity to produce reaction torques on narrow supports. We hypothesized that leg length control to enhance branch reaction control authority would markedly expand the range of successful landing conditions, drawing on the same powerful leg actuation required for leaping. Exploring this balance strategy, the monopedal robot Salto-1P demonstrates branch-to-branch leaps, including some upright balanced landings, despite negligible grasping torque. We also compared this landing strategy with the landings of squirrels, which similarly lack the grip strength found in other arboreal species. We demonstrate that greater radial force control reduces the inertial body torque and/or grasping torque at the support required to balance a given landing. Adding simple radial force balance control strategies to conventional balance controllers greatly expands potential landing conditions, increasing the range of initial angular momentum that can be balanced by 230 and 470% across ranges of landing angles for low-order models of the robot and squirrel, respectively.},

In this study, we present a design strategy for a centimeter-scale deep-sea soft actuator, weighing 16 grams, that incorporates bistable chiral metamaterials and tube-sealed shape memory alloys. According to our design, the increased modulus induced by the hydrostatic pressure was used to achieve a higher snapping velocity of the bistable chiral unit, thus lifting the actuator’s performance. We showed that the actuator can produce undistorted cyclic motions at various depths in the deep sea. Subsequently, we developed an untethered miniature deep-sea robot that is capable of multimodal locomotion by repurposing its legs and fins. To validate the robot’s performance, this miniature robot was deployed from deep-sea crewed submersibles, performing swimming, gliding, morphing, and crawling in the Haima Cold Seep (1380-meter depth) and the Mariana Trench (10,600-meter depth); it was then retrieved by the submersible fully intact. The actuation module design enabled the robot to perform comparably in the Haima Cold Seep and laboratory aquarium conditions (atmospheric pressure). Additionally, we developed a wearable soft gripper based on the same metamaterial design strategy to facilitate safe deep-sea operations, ranging from soft-specimen collection to heavy-object manipulation (~3400-meter depth). This study offers design insights into creating next-generation miniature deep-sea actuators and robots, paving the way for future exploration and interaction with deep-sea ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Operating in the brain for deep-seated tumors or surgical targets for epilepsy is technically demanding and normally requires a large craniotomy with its attendant risk and morbidity. Neuroendoscopic surgery has the potential to reduce risk and morbidity by permitting surgical access through a small incision with burr hole and a narrow corridor through the brain. However, current endoscopic neurosurgical tools are straight and rigid and lack dexterity, hindering their adoption for neuroendoscopic procedures. We propose a class of robotic neurosurgical tools that have magnetically actuated wristed end effectors small enough to fit through a neuroendoscope working channel. The tools were less than 3.2 millimeters in overall diameter and contained embedded permanent magnets that allowed wireless actuation with magnetic fields. Three magnetic tools are presented: a two–degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) wristed gripper, a one-DoF pivoting scalpel, and a one-DoF twisted string–actuated forceps. This work evaluated the feasibility of these tools for completing minimally invasive neurosurgical resection and cutting tasks. Experimental tests on a silicone brain phantom showed that the tools could reach the ventricle area for simulated tumor removal and access a section of the corpus callosotomy for a simulated tissue-severing procedure in epilepsy treatment. Integration of the magnetic end effectors with a concentric tube robot as a hybrid steerable surgical robotic system enabled in vivo experiments on piglets. These experiments show that wireless magnetic tools could perform essential neurosurgical tasks, including gripping, cutting, and biopsy on living brain tissue, suggesting their potential for clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {The integration of social robots into family environments raises critical questions about their long-term influence on family interactions. This study explores the potential of social robots as conversational catalysts in human-human dyadic interaction, focusing on enhancing high-quality, reciprocal conversations between parents and children during dialogic coreading activities. With the increasing prevalence of social robots in homes and the recognized importance of parent-child exchanges for children’s developmental milestones, this work presents a comprehensive empirical investigation involving more than 70 parent-child dyads over a period of 1 to 2 months. We examined the effects of three robot interaction styles—a passive robot listener, an active robot with a fixed behavior strategy, and an active robot with a strategy-switching mechanism—on parent-child conversational dynamics. Our findings reveal that a robot’s active participation enhances the quality of parent-child dialogic conversations. The influence of robot facilitation varied on the basis of parental English proficiency. Strategy-switching robots provided greater benefits to non–native English–speaking families, whereas dyads with native English–speaking parents benefited more from fixed-strategy robots. Overall, this study highlights the promise of social robots that empower parents in fostering their children’s dialogic development—a contrast with the prevalent design of educational robots that primarily target children. It provides critical insights into the equitable, nuanced design of long-term family-robot interactions at home, especially in supporting diverse family backgrounds.},

  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) control many physiological processes and are important pharmacological targets. Luebbers et al. developed an optical biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that directly measures the endogenous activation of Gα i subunits in response to GPCR stimulation in both cell lines and mouse astrocytes. In a neuronal cell line, experiments with Gα i bONE-GO revealed that several neuropeptides classified as full agonists of opioid receptors instead behaved as partial agonists. Unlike biosensors typically used to measure GPCR activation, Gα i bONE-GO does not depend on exogenously expressed receptors or G proteins and can be deployed in many cell types using a single expression construct. —Annalisa M. VanHook The activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) by G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a mechanism broadly used by eukaryotes to transduce signals across the plasma membrane and a target for many clinical drugs. Many optical biosensors commonly used for measuring GPCR-stimulated G protein activity rely on exogenously expressed GPCRs and/or G proteins, which compromise readout fidelity. Biosensors that measure endogenous signaling may interfere with the signaling process under investigation or have a limited dynamic range of detection, hindering applicability. Here, we developed an optical BRET-based biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that detects endogenous GTP-bound (active) Gα i upon stimulation of endogenous GPCRs more robustly than existing sensors of endogenous activity. Its design leverages the Gα i -binding protein GINIP as a high-affinity and specific detector of Gα i -GTP. We optimized this design to prevent interference with downstream G i -dependent signaling and to enable implementation in different experimental systems having endogenous GPCRs, including adenosine receptors in primary astroglial cells and opioid receptors in cell lines. In a neuronal cell line, Gα i bONE-GO revealed activation profiles indicating that several natural opioid neuropeptides acted as partial agonists, in contrast with their characterization as full agonists using biosensors that depend on exogenously expressed receptors and G proteins. The Gα i bONE-GO biosensor is a direct and sensitive detector of endogenous activation of Gα i proteins by GPCRs in different experimental settings but does not interfere with the subsequent propagation of signaling.},

  abstract     = {Many cancers suppress immune surveillance and resist immune-targeted therapies. Chen et al. found that antitumor immunity and treatment might be improved by harnessing an antibody associated with the autoimmune disease lupus. The antibody, called 4H2, was taken up into cells where it bound to endogenous (“self”) RNA to recruit and activate the nucleic acid sensor cGAS, which initiated inflammatory signaling that was cytotoxic to brain, lung, and breast cancer cells in culture but not to normal breast epithelial cells. In mice with glioblastomas, 4H2 localized to the tumor microenvironment after systemic administration, improved animal survival in a T cell–dependent manner, and improved the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, demonstrating its potential for treating patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Nucleic acid–mediated signaling triggers an immune response that is believed to be central to the pathophysiology of autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we found that a cell-penetrating, SLE-associated antiguanosine autoantibody may present therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment. The autoantibody entered cells through a nucleoside salvage-linked pathway of membrane transit that avoids endosomes and lysosomes and bound to endogenous RNA in live cells. In orthotopic models of glioblastoma, the antibody localized to areas adjacent to necrotic tumor cells and promoted animal survival in a manner that depended on T cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that antibody binding to nucleic acids activated the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), thereby stimulating immune signaling and cGAS-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, the autoantibody could carry and deliver functional RNA into tumor, brain, and muscle tissues in live mice when administered locally. The findings establish a collaborative autoantibody–nucleic acid interaction that is translatable to strategies for nonviral gene delivery and immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Because the STAT family of transcriptional regulators induces the expression of genes involved in antiviral signaling, they are often targeted by viruses to suppress immune responses. Activation of STATs by tyrosine phosphorylation induces their dimerization, and STAT dimers can assemble into tetramers with different transcriptional properties. Sugiyama et al . solved the cryo-EM structure of a tetrameric form of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 in complex with DNA, showing how interactions between N-terminal domains of the protein supported the dimerization of STAT1 dimers. Biochemical analyses and modeling further indicated how the rabies virus P-protein specifically targets STAT1 tetramers, suggesting a potential mechanism of immune evasion. —John F. Foley Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members mediate signaling in the Janus kinase (JAK)–STAT pathway and are activated by phosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine residue, resulting in dimerization through reciprocal interactions between the phosphotyrosine and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT (pY-STAT) then translocates to the nucleus to induce the expression of genes encoding antiviral proteins. Although the active and functional forms of STATs are conventionally considered to be dimers, STATs can undergo higher-order oligomerization, which is implicated in regulating transcriptional activity. We present the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the tetrameric form of intact pY-STAT1 in complex with DNA, which indicates that interactions between the amino-terminal domains (NTDs) of STAT1 induce oligomerization. The tetrameric structure revealed a compact conformation with a previously uncharacterized binding interface: Two DNA-bound dimers are twofold symmetrically aligned to transform into a tandem DNA-binding model without NTD dimer separation. Moreover, biochemical analyses indicated that the rabies virus P-protein selectively targeted tetrameric pY-STAT1. Combined with data showing which regions contribute to the interaction between pY-STAT1 and the P-protein, we constructed a binding model explaining how P recognizes the pY-STAT1 tetramer. These data provide insight into how pathogenic viruses target signaling pathways that mediate the host immune response.},

  abstract     = {In prostate cancers, the abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4 is inversely correlated with response to the antiandrogen (also known as an androgen receptor inhibitor) enzalutamide. Zhang et al. found that PDCD4 is repressed by the mitotic kinase PLK1, which enabled the activity of cell survival pathways that are androgen independent. In prostate cancer cell lines, PLK1 promoted the degradation of PDCD4, which released a brake on c-MYC, stimulating its activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and metabolic pathways that reduced cellular dependence on androgen receptor signaling and thus reduced sensitivity to enzalutamide. Treatment with the Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib restored enzalutamide sensitivity in tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that this may be an effective strategy in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Enzalutamide, a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor (also known as an antiandrogen), is used to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Tumors often acquire resistance to enzalutamide. Tumor progression and enzalutamide resistance are associated with decreased abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4. In normal dividing cells, PDCD4 abundance is low when that of the kinase PLK1 is high. In this study, we found that PLK1 acted on PDCD4 to promote enzalutamide resistance in CRPC cells in culture and in mice via a mechanism that revealed an effective combination therapy. PLK1 phosphorylated PDCD4 at Ser 239 , leading to its degradation and consequently inducing the transcriptional activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by c-MYC. Hh signaling supports tumor cell proliferation and stemness by inducing the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15), which promotes the metabolic clearance of drugs and steroid hormones. Thus, this pathway may circumvent androgen receptor dependence, thereby reducing cellular sensitivity to enzalutamide. Knocking down UGT2B15 enhanced enzalutamide-induced cell apoptosis and growth arrest in a PDCD4-dependent manner. Combining enzalutamide with the clinically approved Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in enzalutamide-resistant cell cultures and xenografts in vivo. Our findings reveal a mechanism of PLK1-mediated enzalutamide resistance and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance in prostate cancer.},

The kinase ATM is a major initial response protein that facilitates the activation of other repair proteins. Alonso-Marañón et al. found that ATM complexes are directed to sites of damage by the protein NEMO, a regulatory subunit in the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway (see also the Focus by Perkins). In cells exposed to ultraviolet light or a chemotherapeutic, NEMO bound to ATM in complex with the NF-κB–associated protein IKKα and directed the complexes to damaged DNA to promote efficient repair. Increased expression of NEMO-encoding transcripts in colorectal cancers correlated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis, suggesting that NEMO may predict tumors that could be effectively treated with DNA repair inhibitors. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The DNA damage repair kinase ATM is phosphorylated by the NF-κB pathway kinase IKKα, resulting in enhanced DNA damage repair through the nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Thus, inhibition of IKKα enhances the efficacy of cancer therapy based on inducing DNA damage. Here, we found a role for the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO in DNA damage repair mediated by ATM and IKKα. Exposure to damaging agents induced the interaction of NEMO with a preformed ATM-IKKα complex, which was required to target active ATM and IKKα to chromatin for efficient DNA damage repair but not for activating ATM. Recognition of damaged DNA by the IKKα-NEMO-ATM complex was facilitated by the interaction between NEMO and histones and depended on the ADP ribosylation of histones by the enzyme PARP1. NEMO-deficient cells showed increased activity of the kinase ATR, and inhibition of ATR potentiated the effect of chemotherapy in cells lacking NEMO or IKKα. Bioinformatic analysis of colorectal cancer datasets demonstrated that the expression of genes encoding IKKα, NEMO, and ATM correlated with poor patient prognosis, suggesting that the mechanism linking these three elements may be clinically relevant.},

Wang et al. investigated the role of the deacetylating enzyme sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) in adipose tissue macrophages in regulating norepinephrine amounts in brown adipose tissue. Obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet was exacerbated by SIRT6 deficiency in macrophages. SIRT6 decreased the promoter acetylation and expression of genes encoding a norepinephrine transporter and an enzyme that degrades norepinephrine. Thus, SIRT6 in macrophages prevents the degradation of norepinephrine, thereby ensuring the thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue and limiting obesity in mice. —Wei Wong Brown and beige adipocytes dissipate energy to generate heat through uncoupled respiration, and the hormone norepinephrine plays an important role in stimulating brown fat thermogenesis and beige adipocyte development in white adipose depots. Increasing energy expenditure by promoting the function and development of brown and beige fat is a potential approach to treat obesity and diabetes. Here, we investigated the effects of macrophage sirtuin 6 (SIRT6 ) on the regulation of the norepinephrine content of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and on obesity in mice. Myeloid SIRT6 deficiency impaired the thermogenic function of BAT, thereby decreasing core body temperatures because of reduced norepinephrine concentrations in BAT and subsequently leading to cold sensitivity. In addition, the oxygen consumption rate was reduced, resulting in severe insulin resistance and obesity. Furthermore, macrophage SIRT6 deficiency inhibited BAT thermogenesis after cold exposure or norepinephrine treatment and cold exposure–induced increases in markers of lipid metabolism and thermogenesis in white adipose tissue. Myeloid-specific SIRT6 deficiency promoted H3K9 acetylation in the promoter regions and the expression of genes encoding the norepinephrine-degrading enzyme MAOA and the norepinephrine transporter SLC6A2 in macrophages in BAT, leading to norepinephrine degradation and obesity.

  abstract     = {The acetyltransferase GCN5 is implicated in various diseases involving inflammation in peripheral tissues. Cho et al. found that GCN5 mediates inflammation in the brain as well, suggesting that it may be a target for treating neuroinflammatory diseases. In mice, inducing an innate immune response in the periphery (to mimic an infection) selectively increased the abundance of GCN5 in microglia in the brain. GCN5 acetylated a subunit of the transcription factor NF-κB, thus enabling its transcriptional activity and the production of inflammatory cytokines and associated proteins. Treating mice with GCN5 inhibitors prevented this response, suggesting that this approach may treat neuroinflammatory disease. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Neuroinflammation promotes the progression of various neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Disrupted homeostasis of protein acetylation is implicated in neurodegeneration, and the lysine acetyltransferase GCN5 (also known as KAT2A) is implicated in peripheral inflammation. Here, we investigated whether GCN5 plays a role in neuroinflammation in the brain. Systemic administration of the bacterial molecule LPS in mice to induce peripheral inflammation increased the abundance of GCN5 in various organs, including in the brain and specifically in microglia. In response to LPS, GCN5 mediated the induction of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and the inflammatory mediators COX-2 and iNOS in microglia. Further investigation in cultured microglial cells revealed that GCN5 was activated downstream of the innate immune receptor TLR4 to acetylate Lys 310 in the NF-κB subunit p65, thereby enabling the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB and the resulting inflammatory response. Thus, targeting GCN5 might be explored further as a strategy to reduce neuroinflammation in the treatment of associated diseases.},
