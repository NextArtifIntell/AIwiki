  abstract     = {Extremely palatable food is pleasant and can cause prolonged consumption, which sometimes leads to overeating and obesity. The neural circuits underlying this eating behavior are poorly understood. Zhu et al . found that neurons projecting from a brain region surrounding the locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) mediated the increase of palatable food consumption (see the Perspective by Small). Temporally precise closed-loop VTA dopamine-releasing neuron modulation exclusively during consumption was critical for controlling this behavior. Activation of satiety pathways with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist suppressed VTA dopamine-releasing neuron responses during palatable food consumption. These findings reveal that VTA dopamine-releasing neurons encode palatability and control the consummatory phase of eating dependent on the specific timing of their activity. —Peter Stern Hedonic eating is defined as food consumption driven by palatability without physiological need. However, neural control of palatable food intake is poorly understood. We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by a neural pathway from the peri–locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTA DA ) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTA DA neuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTA DA neuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTA DA neuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTA DA neurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide.},

  abstract     = {Obesity is frequently seen not only in humans, but also in dogs, and some breeds are particularly at risk. Owner behaviors such as limiting food access and providing physical activity can help mitigate the dogs’ risks, but genetic variants are also thought to play a role. Wallis et al . performed a genome-wide association study in hundreds of pet Labrador retrievers and identified the gene DENND1B as a major culprit in these dogs’ obesity. The authors demonstrated that DENND1B regulates the activity of the melanocortin 4 receptor, which plays a major role in energy homeostasis. They also identified a human patient with a mutation in DENND1B and other humans with additional mutations found in the dogs, demonstrating the connection to human physiology. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Obesity is a heritable disease, but its genetic basis is incompletely understood. Canine population history facilitates trait mapping. We performed a canine genome-wide association study for body condition score—a measure of obesity—in 241 Labrador retrievers. Using a cross-species approach, we showed that canine obesity genes are also associated with rare and common forms of obesity in humans. The lead canine association was within the gene DENN domain containing 1B ( DENND1B ). Each copy of the alternate allele was associated with ~7% greater body fat. We demonstrate a role for this gene in regulating signaling and trafficking of melanocortin 4 receptor, a critical controller of energy homeostasis. Thus, canine genetics identified obesity genes and mechanisms relevant to both dogs and humans.},

  abstract     = {Beginning as early as 5000 years ago and lasting until just around 150 years ago, horses were integral to human societies. Their capacity for intense exertion led to their being used as everything from beasts of burden to elite racers. This athleticism is largely driven by increased oxygen consumption rates due to muscles full of mitochondria. Castiglione et al . found that horses evolved to cope with the increased oxidative burden brought about by mitochondrial activity through the evolution of a single point mutation that increases oxidative phosphorylation while simultaneously mitigating the consequent oxidative stress. —Sacha Vignieri Horses are among nature’s greatest athletes, yet the ancestral molecular adaptations fueling their energy demands are poorly understood. Within a clinically important pathway regulating redox and metabolic homeostasis (NRF2/KEAP1), we discovered an ancient mutation—conserved in all extant equids—that increases mitochondrial respiration while decreasing tissue-damaging oxidative stress. This mutation is a de novo premature opal stop codon in KEAP1 that is translationally recoded into a cysteine through previously unknown mechanisms, producing an R15C mutation in KEAP1 that is more sensitive to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. This recoding enables increased NRF2 activity, which enhances mitochondrial adenosine 5′-triphosphate production and cellular resistance to oxidative damage. Our study illustrates how recoding of a de novo stop codon, a strategy thought restricted to viruses, can facilitate adaptation in vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {Integral membrane proteins are essential for cell signaling, adhesion, migration, and nutrient uptake, and are ultimately degraded in catabolic organelles known as lysosomes. Breakdown of the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains of integral membrane proteins is especially challenging, and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Combining organelle proteomics, untargeted metabolomics, and reconstitution assays, Jain et al . identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP) as the protease responsible for degrading hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which has a high level of endocytosis. LyLAP ablation caused undigested hydrophobic domains to accumulate and led to lysosomal damage and PDA cell death, highlighting the critical role of this process under conditions of high membrane protein turnover. —Stella M. Hurtley Breakdown of every transmembrane protein trafficked to lysosomes requires proteolysis of their hydrophobic helical transmembrane domains. Combining lysosomal proteomics with functional genomic datasets, we identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP; formerly phospholipase B domain–containing 1) as the hydrolase most tightly associated with elevated endocytosis. Untargeted metabolomics and biochemical reconstitution demonstrated that LyLAP is a processive monoaminopeptidase with preference for amino-terminal leucine. This activity was necessary and sufficient for the breakdown of hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP was up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which relies on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. In PDA cells, LyLAP ablation led to the buildup of undigested hydrophobic peptides, lysosomal membrane damage, and growth inhibition. Thus, LyLAP enables lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins and protects lysosomal integrity in highly endocytic cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {Mammalian development is a complex and intricately organized process that we are just beginning to understand, in part because it requires coordinated interactions between many distinct cell types that change over time. To gain insight into this process, Li et al . developed sequencing methods for assessing chromatin accessibility in individual cells. They then applied these methods to mouse embryos at 10 distinct stages, ranging from the zygote to the late blastocyst, mapping key changes in chromatin state in different cell lineages over the course of these key stages in early development. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich In mammals, fertilized eggs undergo genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming to generate the organism. However, our understanding of epigenetic dynamics during preimplantation development at single-cell resolution remains incomplete. Here, we developed scNanoATAC-seq2, a single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using long-read sequencing for scarce samples. We present a detailed chromatin accessibility landscape of mouse preimplantation development, revealing distinct chromatin signatures in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm during lineage segregation. Differences between zygotes and two-cell embryos highlight reprogramming in chromatin accessibility during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Single-cell long-read sequencing enables in-depth analysis of chromatin accessibility in noncanonical imprinting, imprinted X chromosome inactivation, and low-mappability genomic regions, such as repetitive elements and paralogs. Our data provide insights into chromatin dynamics during mammalian preimplantation development and lineage differentiation.},

  abstract     = {Many bacteria maintain their genomic DNA as circular plasmids, but some species keep their chromosomes as linear molecules, similar to eukaryotes. The ends of linear chromosomes have adaptations called telomeres that are protected and maintained by enzymes. Hsieh et al . discovered a class of parasitic DNA elements called transposons that bias integration into chromosome ends. These telomeric transposons use special assembly and targeting mechanisms and have their own telomere maintenance systems that allow the element to control the chromosome end. These bacteria thus need to preserve the transposon, which ensures its survival and shapes how it exchanges genetic information. —Di Jiang Eukaryotes have linear DNA, and their telomeres are hotspots for transposons, which in some cases took over telomere maintenance. We identified several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . Although these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, substantially influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.},

Kim et al . reviewed recent developments in the field of complex frequency excitations in photonics and in other fields of physics governed by wave equations. In this excitation scheme, the signal pulses exponentially grow or decrease in amplitude over time. This dynamical behavior allows passive systems to mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to non-Hermitian responses without specific material modifications and leading to exotic optical effects. Applicable to wave systems in general, such complex excitations can be applied to developments in metamaterials, optical computing, sensing, and image processing. —Ian S. Osborne Closed, lossless optical cavities are characterized by a Hamiltonian that obeys Hermiticity, resulting in strictly real-valued resonance frequencies. By contrast, non-Hermitian wave systems are characterized by Hamiltonians with poles and zeros at complex frequencies, whose control through precise engineering of material loss and gain can lead to exotic scattering phenomena. Notably, excitation signals that oscillate at complex-valued frequencies can mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to these non-Hermitian responses without material modifications. These findings have been advancing the fundamental understanding of wave-matter interactions and are enabling breakthroughs in metamaterials, imaging, sensing, and computing.

  abstract     = {Plant immunity relies heavily on intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, which can act as either receptors or signal transducers to facilitate disease resistance. In wheat and barley, an alternative class of genes called the tandem kinases also contribute to disease resistance. Two papers in this issue elucidate how tandem kinases work, showing that wheat tandem kinases require an NLR to function. Chen et al . found a pathogen effector that triggers the action of the wheat Sr62 tandem kinase. They demonstrate that the effector interacts with Sr62’s active kinase domain, enabling a pseudokinase domain to activate the corresponding NLR. In parallel, Lu et al . found that a different tandem kinase, WTK3, activates the same NLR as Sr62, and that this NLR acts as a calcium ion channel once activated. Together, these studies solidify the role of NLRs as hubs for immune signaling in response to diverse pathogens and will guide breeding efforts for disease-resistant wheat. —Madeleine Seale Tandem kinase proteins underlie the innate immune systems of cereal plants, but how they initiate plant immune responses remains unclear. This report identifies wheat protein wheat tandem NBD 1 (WTN1), a noncanonical nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor featuring tandem nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, plant R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domains, required for WTK3-mediated disease resistance. Both WTK3 and its allelic variant Rwt4—known for conferring resistance to wheat powdery mildew and blast, respectively—are capable of recognizing the blast effector PWT4. They activate WTN1 to form calcium-permeable channels, akin to ZAR1 and Sr35. Thus, tandem kinase proteins and their associated NLRs operate as “sensor-executor” pairs against fungal pathogens. Additionally, evolutionary analyses reveal a coevolutionary trajectory of the tandem kinase-NLR module, highlighting their cooperative role in triggering plant immunity.},

This mixture resulted in precipitates of nanoscale clusters of Cu 3 Li coated with Ta. This core-shell structure neither dissolves nor coarsens at temperatures of up to 800°C while also causing the yielding strength to be in excess of 1 gigapascal. —Marc S. Lavine We present a bulk nanocrystalline copper alloy that can operate at near-melting temperatures with minimal coarsening and creep deformation. The thermal stability of the Cu-3Ta-0.5Li atomic % (at %) alloy is attributed to coherent, ordered L1 2 Cu 3 Li precipitates surrounded by a tantalum-rich atomic bilayer phase boundary complexion. Adding 0.5 at % lithium to the immiscible Cu-Ta system changes the morphology of the nanoscale precipitates from spherical to cuboidal while simultaneously tailoring the phase boundary. The resultant complexion-stabilized nanoscale precipitates provide excellent thermal stability, strength, and creep resistance.

Seo et al . combined soil moisture data from satellites, measurements of sea level, and observations of polar motion to estimate terrestrial water storage over the past four decades, which revealed a dramatic decline (see the Perspective by Samaniego). During the interval from 2000 to 2002, terrestrial water storage decreased by nearly twice as much as Greenland ice mass loss over the same period. —Jesse Smith Rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures have caused substantial changes in terrestrial water circulation and land surface water fluxes, such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, potentially leading to abrupt shifts in terrestrial water storage. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) soil moisture (SM) product reveals a sharp depletion during the early 21st century. During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland’s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002–2006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift (~45 centimeters). Precipitation deficits and stable evapotranspiration likely caused this decline, and SM has not recovered as of 2021, with future recovery unlikely under present climate conditions.},

  abstract     = {Plant immunity relies heavily on intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, which can act as either receptors or signal transducers to facilitate disease resistance. In wheat and barley, an alternative class of genes called the tandem kinases also contribute to disease resistance. Two papers in this issue elucidate how tandem kinases work, showing that wheat tandem kinases require an NLR to function. Chen et al . found a pathogen effector that triggers the action of the wheat Sr62 tandem kinase. They demonstrate that the effector interacts with Sr62’s active kinase domain, enabling a pseudokinase domain to activate the corresponding NLR. In parallel, Lu et al . found that a different tandem kinase, WTK3, activates the same NLR as Sr62, and that this NLR acts as a calcium ion channel once activated. Together, these studies solidify the role of NLRs as hubs for immune signaling in response to diverse pathogens and will guide breeding efforts for disease-resistant wheat. —Madeleine Seale The role of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors in plant immunity is well studied, but the function of a class of tandem kinases (TKs) that confer disease resistance in wheat and barley remains unclear. In this study, we show that the SR62 locus is a digenic module encoding the Sr62 TK TK and an NLR (Sr62 NLR ), and we identify the corresponding AvrSr62 effector. AvrSr62 binds to the N-terminal kinase 1 of Sr62 TK , triggering displacement of kinase 2, which activates Sr62 NLR . Modeling and mutation analysis indicated that this is mediated by overlapping binding sites (i) on kinase 1 for binding AvrSr62 and kinase 2 and (ii) on kinase 2 for binding kinase 1 and Sr62 NLR . Understanding this two-component resistance complex may help engineering and breeding plants for durable resistance.},

  abstract     = {US police detain racial or ethnic minority drivers (Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic) more than white drivers. However, a longstanding debate remains unsettled: Does this necessarily reflect police bias? Hypothetically, if minorities were more prone to disobey speed limits and traffic laws, then their traffic stops may be warranted. To put this debate to rest, Aggarwal et al . examined rideshare data from Lyft in the state of Florida to compare minority drivers with their white counterparts. Lyft objectively measured drivers’ locations, driving speed, and location speed limits (see the Perspective by Knox and Mummolo). White and minority drivers showed no discernible differences in speeding behaviors or traffic violations. However, when both drove at identical speeds, police were still 33% more likely to issue speeding citations to minority drivers and charged 34% more expensive fines, unequivocally revealing bias. —Ekeoma Uzogara Prior research on racial profiling has found that in encounters with law enforcement, minorities are punished more severely than white civilians. Less is known about the causes of these encounters and their implications for our understanding of racial profiling. Using high-frequency location data of rideshare drivers in Florida ( N = 222,838 individuals), we estimate the effect of driver race on citations and fines for speeding using 19.3 million location pings. Compared with a white driver traveling the same speed, we find that racial or ethnic minority drivers are 24 to 33% more likely to be cited for speeding and pay 23 to 34% more money in fines. We find no evidence that accident and reoffense rates explain these estimates, which suggests that an animus against minorities underlies our results.},

  abstract     = {Demography is critical for understanding how genetic variation has moved through time and space, and thus the selective and stochastic forces involved. However, these patterns are difficult to determine from modern genomes alone because different scenarios can result in similar genomic outcomes. Grundler et al . created a method using ancestral recombination graphs to trace the spatiotemporal history of DNA segments shared between modern humans (see the Perspective by Gravel). They predicted the least costly migration paths for their sampled individuals back through 200,000 years ago, showing that the most likely path out of Africa was the northern route. This method may prove useful in other species and could provide an alternate way to account for shared ancestry in genetic studies. —Corinne N. Simonti Describing the distribution of genetic variation across individuals is a fundamental goal of population genetics. We present a method that capitalizes on the rich genealogical information encoded in genomic tree sequences to infer the geographic locations of the shared ancestors of a sample of sequenced individuals. We used this method to infer the geographic history of genetic ancestry of a set of human genomes sampled from Europe, Asia, and Africa, accurately recovering major population movements on those continents. Our findings demonstrate the importance of defining the spatiotemporal context of genetic ancestry when describing human genetic variation and caution against the oversimplified interpretations of genetic data prevalent in contemporary discussions of race and ancestry.},

These signals come from a rich collection of receptors that exist in the skin. Ha et al . developed a single actuator unit that can exert complex combinations of dynamic forces, including pressure, shear, vibration, displacement, and torque, to achieve haptic information transfer and realistic virtual tactile sensations. The authors demonstrate the application of this system in hand navigation, reproduction of textural sensation, and tactile perception of music, with a broader goal of using the actuator for biomedical and extended reality applications. —Marc S. Lavine The sense of touch conveys critical environmental information, facilitating object recognition, manipulation, and social interaction, and can be engineered through haptic actuators that stimulate cutaneous receptors. An unfulfilled challenge lies in haptic interface technologies that can engage all the various mechanoreceptors in a programmable, spatiotemporal fashion across large areas of the body. Here, we introduce a small-scale actuator technology that can impart omnidirectional, superimposable, dynamic forces to the surface of skin, as the basis for stimulating individual classes of mechanoreceptors or selected combinations of them. High-bit haptic information transfer and realistic virtual tactile sensations are possible, as illustrated through human subject perception studies in extended reality applications that include advanced hand navigation, realistic texture reproduction, and sensory substitution for music perception.},

Sun et al . report the application of a class of sulfonyl hydrazide reactants that do not require external reduction. Simple heating with nickel catalysts forges a wide variety of carbon-carbon bonds to alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and aryl partners through a radical pathway. —Jake S. Yeston Sulfonyl hydrazides are stable and usually crystalline substances that can be accessed in a variety of ways, including transiently from hydrazones, to achieve a net reductive arylation of carbonyl compounds. We show their utility as versatile radical precursors, as exemplified with seven C–C bond–forming, redox-neutral cross-couplings with activated olefins, alkyl halides, redox-active esters, aryl halides, alkenyl halides, alkynyl halides, and a trifluoromethylating reagent, to forge C(sp 3 )-C(sp 3 ), C(sp 3 )-C(sp 2 ), and C(sp 3 )-C(sp) bonds. Exogenous redox (chemical, photo/electrochemical) additives are not necessary because these functional groups serve the dual role of radical precursor and electron donor.

This article begins by explaining how Chinese policy-makers have recently stepped up efforts to guide science in keeping with national priorities, including economic, environmental, and national security concerns. It then notes an important countercurrent, particularly the growing interest in “original innovation” and the appreciation that curiosity-driven research has a role to play in this regard.

  abstract     = {Singers in a choir are separated by distances, but their voices are perfectly synchronized to make a harmony. Similarly, particles in a quantum system are entangled to share some correlated feature even if they are far away. This phenomenon, called quantum entanglement ( 1 ), is important for quantum information processing but highly sensitive to decoherence (loss of quantum properties) ( 2 ). Exposure to uncontrolled environments, such as thermal fluctuations, causes entangled particles to pick up random noises, which leads to a so-called mixed state. Fortunately, there are ways to “filter” a mixed state back into a pure entangled state by engineering a quantum bath (or reservoir)—a controlled environment to which the system is coupled ( 3 , 4 ). On page 1424 of this issue, Selim et al. ( 5 ) report a new way to filter entangled photons by exploiting a fundamental physics concept that is extensively applied in classical context, called non-Hermitian symmetries. This could offer a new way of solving a key challenge in quantum technology.},

  abstract     = {The capacity to store energy as fat enables animals to ensure energy reserves for the future. In this context, eating beyond satiety (fullness) is a beneficial, adaptive behavior. However, in many human populations, this adaptive behavior is made maladaptive by readily available, energy-dense sources of food, resulting in high rates of obesity. One such behavior, called invigoration, causes an increase in speed, duration, and intake of a palatable food ( 1 ). The neural mechanisms underlying this behavior are not yet clear. On page 1376 of this issue, Zhu et al . ( 2 ) report a brain circuit that drives feeding invigoration in mice. This circuit begins with neurons in the area around the locus coeruleus (periLC) and results in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The finding provides a neural target, the therapeutic modulation of which might enable changes to food intake by preventing invigoration.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial cells often polarize along a tissue plane, a collective cell behavior known as planar cell polarity (PCP). To couple polarity between cells, asymmetrically localized PCP proteins bind intercellularly at cell junctions. Although PCP is by definition a multicellular process, the minimal number of cells required for PCP proteins to asymmetrically localize is not known. Basta et al . addressed this issue using chimeric mouse embryos in which dual-PCP reporter cells had been genetically uncoupled from their neighbors. They found that intercellular binding between just two cells was both necessary and sufficient to initiate the sorting of PCP complexes into asymmetric bridges. —Stella M. Hurtley For cells to polarize collectively along a tissue plane, asymmetrically localized planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes must form intercellular contacts between neighboring cells. Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.},

Long-term memory acquisition was found to be associated with a selective increase in multisynaptic boutons without the involvement of simultaneous activation of synaptically connected neurons. These results challenge the general applicability of the Hebbian model and expand our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for memory formation. —Mattia Maroso Memory engrams are formed through experience-dependent plasticity of neural circuits, but their detailed architectures remain unresolved. Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we performed nanoscale reconstructions of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway after chemogenetic labeling of cellular ensembles recruited during associative learning. Neurons with a remote history of activity coinciding with memory acquisition showed no strong preference for wiring with each other. Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes.

Two studies in this issue combine theory with existing data on multiple taxonomic groups to understand these relationships. Pigot et al . show that biomass generally increases with species richness because large-bodied species tend to be rare. Liang et al . show that ecosystem stability increases with area because of its relationship with biodiversity. Larger areas tend to have more species and more asynchrony between species, leading to greater stability. Together, these studies provide further insight into how biodiversity affects other ecosystem properties. —Bianca Lopez While both species richness and ecosystem stability increase with area, how these scaling patterns are linked remains unclear. Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.},

We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task.

Leveraging the strong atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrated fast qubit-state readout with 99.960 − 24 + 14 % fidelity and two methods for cavity-mediated entanglement generation with integrated error detection. First, we used cavity-carving to generate a Bell state with 91(4)% fidelity and a 32(1)% success rate (the number in parentheses is the standard deviation). Second, we performed a cavity-mediated gate with a deterministic entanglement fidelity of 52.5(18)%, increased to 76(2)% with error detection.

  abstract     = {The mitochondrial respiratory chain consists of membrane-integral complexes that build up the proton gradient across the membranes of the cristae, thereby powering ATP synthase. Waltz et al . used cryo–electron tomography to resolve native structures of these complexes directly within the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . Their findings reveal how respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a respirasome supercomplex, which is restricted to flat membrane regions apart from rows of ATP synthase at the curved tips of cristae. The work also captures fine structural details of how respirasomes are held together and how electron-carrier proteins bind these assemblies, offering insights into mitochondrial respiration inside native cells. —Stella M. Hurtley Mitochondria regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. This process is carried out by five membrane-bound complexes collectively known as the respiratory chain, working in concert to transfer electrons and pump protons. The precise organization of these complexes in native cells is debated. We used in situ cryo–electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes segregate into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively. Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a respirasome supercomplex, from which we determined a native 5-angstrom (Å) resolution structure showing binding of electron carrier cytochrome c . Combined with single-particle cryo–electron microscopy at 2.4-Å resolution, we model how the respiratory complexes organize inside native mitochondria.},

  abstract     = {Approximately 30% of the carbon emitted by human activity has been taken up on land, but exactly how and where that uptake has been achieved has been an open question. Bar-On et al . examined existing observational records of terrestrial carbon pools and found that live biomass has stored only a small fraction of that carbon, the bulk having been incorporated into nonliving organic matter (see the Perspective by Canadell). This work has important implications for understanding how quickly carbon is returned to the atmosphere. —Jesse Smith Terrestrial sequestration of carbon has mitigated ≈30% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, its distribution across different pools, live or dead biomass and soil and sedimentary organic carbon, remains uncertain. Analyzing global observational datasets of changes in terrestrial carbon pools, we found that ≈35 ± 14 gigatons of carbon (GtC) have been sequestered on land between 1992 and 2019, whereas live biomass changed by ≈1 ± 7 GtC. Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills.},

  abstract     = {As mountains form, they generate complex topography, heterogeneous environmental conditions, and barriers to movement that can separate populations. Marder et al . investigated whether this process contributes to the high biodiversity often found on mountains. Using simulations, they found that biodiversity increases with tectonic uplift and increasing topographic relief, not only on erosional mountain range highlands but also in adjacent depositional basins. Published long-term datasets on mammal species richness and lizard speciation show similar relationships between mountain building and diversity. —Bianca Lopez Biodiversity hotspots in Earth’s mountain ranges suggest a strong connection between topographic development and biological processes. However, it remains unclear whether high biodiversity in mountain ranges is an evolutionary response to the rate of relief generation during mountain building. Focusing on small mammals, such as rodents, we used coupled landscape-biological simulations to show that biodiversity increases with the magnitude and rate of tectonic uplift. This relationship, visible in depositional lowlands over millions of years, underscores the considerable role of mountain building in shaping past and present terrestrial biodiversity. Our results provide insights into the influence of topographic changes on evolutionary processes, offering a potential link between mountain formation and paleodiversity records.},

  abstract     = {Vascular plants regulate the flow of water and nutrients through their roots by creating a barrier in their extracellular space called the Casparian strip. Shen et al . identified genes involved in Casparian strip formation in Lotus japonicus , a legume that forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Furthermore, the authors established that mutants lacking a Casparian strip were less able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules, implying a connection between these processes. The presence of the Casparian strip also affected expression of the root-shoot signaling peptides that regulate nodulation. This work expands the role of the Casparian strip and links it to the spatial regulation of nodulation in plant roots. —Madeleine Seale Establishment of the apoplastic root barrier known as the Casparian strip occurs early in root development. In legumes, this area overlaps with nitrogen-fixing nodule formation, which raises the possibility that nodulation and barrier formation are connected. Nodules also contain Casparian strips, yet, in this case, their role is unknown. We established mutants with defective barriers in Lotus japonicus . This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation. Our findings further revealed that in nodules, the genetic machinery for Casparian strip formation is shared with roots. Apoplastic blockage controls the metabolic source-sink status required for nitrogen fixation. This identifies Casparian strips as a model system to study spatially constrained symbiotic plant-microbe relationships.},

As such, they are especially susceptible to low blood oxygen levels, which could lead to drowning while submerged. McKnight et al . exposed diving gray seals to various gas mixes and found that the seals responded to low levels of blood oxygen but not high levels of carbon dioxide (see the Perspective by Hawkes and Kendall-Bar). Nearly all other mammals are insensitive to blood oxygen levels, instead gauging blood oxygen by sensing increasing carbon dioxide. Direct sensing of oxygen levels likely improves diving efficiency. —Sacha Vignieri Marine mammals rely on maintaining sufficient blood oxygen levels while diving to prevent drowning. Generally, oxygen is cognitively imperceptible to mammals that instead sense rising carbon dioxide as a proxy for low oxygen. Not perceiving oxygen, however, is risky for diving mammals. We argue that any ability to alter dives based upon direct perception of oxygen should have been strongly selected for. We exposed diving seals to inhaled gas mixes that were experimentally altered to affect circulating levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Dive duration was positively correlated with circulating oxygen levels but unaffected by carbon dioxide levels and pH. These results suggest that seals do cognitively perceive circulating oxygen and use this to alter dive behavior.},

  abstract     = {The number of species in an ecosystem relates to several other key properties, including biomass and stability across time. Two studies in this issue combine theory with existing data on multiple taxonomic groups to understand these relationships. Pigot et al . show that biomass generally increases with species richness because large-bodied species tend to be rare. Liang et al . show that ecosystem stability increases with area because of its relationship with biodiversity. Larger areas tend to have more species and more asynchrony between species, leading to greater stability. Together, these studies provide further insight into how biodiversity affects other ecosystem properties. —Bianca Lopez Despite advances in theory and experiments, how biodiversity influences the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems remains debated. By applying new theory to data on 84,695 plant, animal, and protist assemblages, we show that the general positive effect of species richness on stocks of biomass, as well as much of the variation in the strength and sign of this effect, is predicted by a fundamental macroecological quantity: the scaling of species abundance with body mass. Standing biomass increases with richness when large-bodied species are numerically rare but is independent of richness when species size and abundance are uncoupled. These results suggest a new fundamental law in the structure of ecological communities and show that the impacts of changes in species richness on biomass are predictable.},

Key to the power of quantum computing is the ability to entangle two or more qubits (quantum bits) into joint states that cannot be described by the properties of individual particles alone. Entanglement between neutral-atom qubits has been achieved between atoms close to each other, typically through electromagnetic fields in free space—as opposed to confined to a restricted region of space within a device, such as a cavity between mirrors ( 1 ). On page 1301 of this issue, Grinkemeyer et al . ( 2 ) report that quantum gates that entangle qubits separated by a small optical cavity can perform operations quickly and accurately. The system includes a fiber-optic cable that transmits information over long distances, representing an essential step toward building reliable and large-scale quantum computing networks.},

  abstract     = {Humans typically cannot remember events occurring during the first 3 years of life. This phenomenon, given the name infantile amnesia by Sigmund Freud, has intrigued scientists for more than a century ( 1 ). Do people not remember experiences from infancy because the brain is too immature to form memories, or are these memories formed and then forgotten? This seemingly simple question has been difficult to answer given the technical challenges of studying the infant brain. On page 1316 of this issue, Yates et al . ( 2 ) provide functional neuroimaging evidence that the infant hippocampus (a brain region important for memory) can encode the types of information that are required for episodic memory, that is, memories for specific life events containing information about people, places, and things. This suggests that immaturity of postencoding processes, such as memory consolidation or retrieval, is a more likely explanation for infantile amnesia.},

These carbon sinks, along with the oceans, slow the buildup of atmospheric CO 2 and the pace of global warming. The locations where the absorbed emissions are stored govern the long-term stability and management of carbon pools—those places in Earth’s biosphere that can accumulate, store, and release carbon. Nonetheless, how carbon is dispersed across different pools on land remains unclear. On page 1291 of this issue, Bar-On et al. ( 1 ) report an unexpectedly large distribution of terrestrial carbon in pools of nonliving organic matter that are natural or human made. Carbon sequestration beyond the more vulnerable components, such as trees, could imply greater carbon stability on land than previously thought.

The structures revealed 27 trypanosomatid-specific microtubule inner proteins, a specialized dynein-docking complex, and the presence of paralogous proteins that enable higher-order periodicities or proximal-distal patterning. Leveraging the genetic tractability of trypanosomatid species, we quantified the location and contribution of each structure-identified protein to swimming behavior.

Particularly in certain breast cancer cells that overexpressed fatty acid binding protein 5, mTORC1 was activated by linoleic acid, and this action appeared to be mediated by direct binding of this protein to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR. —L. Bryan Ray Diet influences macronutrient availability to cells, and although mechanisms of sensing dietary glucose and amino acids are well characterized, less is known about sensing lipids. We defined a nutrient signaling mechanism involving fatty acid–binding protein 5 (FABP5) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) that is activated by the essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ω-6 linoleic acid (LA). FABP5 directly bound to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) to enhance formation of functional mTORC1 and substrate binding, ultimately converging on increased mTOR signaling and proliferation. The amounts of FABP5 protein were increased in tumors and serum from triple-negative compared with those from receptor-positive breast cancer patients, which highlights its potential role as a biomarker that mediates cellular responses to ω-6 LA intake in this disease subtype.},

Communication between the endocardium and the myocardium is essential for cardiac morphogenesis. How membrane-localized receptors and ligands achieve interaction across the cardiac jelly is not understood. Working in developing mouse cardiac morphogenesis models, we used a variety of cellular, imaging, and genetic approaches to elucidate this question. We found that myocardium and endocardium interacted directly through microstructures termed tunneling nanotube–like structures (TNTLs). TNTLs extended from cardiomyocytes (CMs) to contact endocardial cells (ECs) directly. TNTLs transported cytoplasmic proteins, transduced signals between CMs and ECs, and initiated myocardial growth toward the heart lumen to form ventricular trabeculae-like structures. Loss of TNTLs disturbed signaling interactions and, subsequently, ventricular patterning.},

They found that mineral production exceeds water resources in many regions because of high production or low water availability. Coal, iron, copper, and gold showed some of the highest overconsumption, coal because of its high production rates and the metals because they require more water to process. Water requirements for mineral production are expected to increase in the future. —Bianca Lopez Although the global economy requires geological resource mining, production has substantial environmental impacts, including the use of regional available water. In this study, we shed light on the global production capacity of 32 mined geological resources, considering regional water availability as a constraint. We found that current resource mining greatly exceeds regional water constraints for several, notably copper (37% of current production exceeds available water capacity) in 2010. Changing the location of production to regions of lower water stress would alleviate current exceedances of water constraints; however, considering economic factors shows that this is not always feasible.

We used low-resolution optical spectra to measure the extinction curve of 130 million stars. By inverting these data, we mapped the extinction curve parameter R ( V ) within the Milky Way in three dimensions and within the Magellanic Clouds in two dimensions. These maps provide improved extinction corrections for astronomical observations. We find that R ( V ) varies with extinction, consistent with dust grains growing by accretion in low-extinction regions and by coagulation in higher-extinction regions. Star-forming regions have high R ( V ) values, indicating either preferential destruction of small dust grains or additional supply of large dust grains in those regions.},

The authors analyzed a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree created using data from natural history collections and the fossil record, including two newly described fossils.

Here, we reveal and classify contributions of individual tropical Asian regions to their overall diversity by leveraging species-level phylogenomic data and new fossils from the most species-rich Asian palm lineage, the rattans and relatives (Arecaceae, Calamoideae). Radiators (Borneo) generate and distribute diversity, incubators (Indochina, New Guinea, and Sulawesi) produce diversity in isolation, corridors (Java, Maluku, Sumatra, and the Thai-Malay Peninsula) connect neighboring regions, and accumulators (Australia, India, Palawan, and the Philippines) acquire diversity generated elsewhere.

They found that production rates are proportional to radiation flux and estimate that this pathway creates more N 2 O than biological production in surface waters, thus constituting a major source of N 2 O emissions globally. —Jesse Smith Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a potent greenhouse gas and the main stratospheric ozone-depleting agent, yet its sources are not well resolved. In this work, we experimentally show a N 2 O production pathway not previously considered in greenhouse gas budgets, which we name photochemodenitrification. Sunlight induces substantial and consistent N 2 O production under oxic abiotic conditions in fresh and marine waters. We measured photochemical N 2 O production rates using isotope tracers and determined that nitrite is the main substrate and that nitrate can also contribute after being photoreduced to nitrite. Additionally, this N 2 O production was strongly correlated to the radiation dose. Photochemodenitrification exceeded biological N 2 O production in surface waters. Although previously overlooked, this process may contribute considerably to global N 2 O emissions through its occurrence in fresh and marine surface waters.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade or so, the identification of melanosomes in some dinosaur feathers and skin has led to the suggestion that many bore bright and complex coloration. Less work has been done to explore the coloration of early mammals. Li et al . looked at melanosome patterns in multiple species of Mesozoic mammals and compared these with those seen in more than 100 species of extant mammals. There was little color variation, and the animals were entirely dark in color. The authors argue that this was likely due to the animals’ nocturnal nature, and that brighter and more varied colors in mammals may have arisen after the extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period. —Sacha Vignieri Pelage coloration, which serves numerous functions, is crucial to the evolution of behavior, physiology, and habitat preferences of mammals. However, little is known about the coloration of Mesozoic mammaliaforms that coevolved with dinosaurs. In this study, we used a dataset of melanosome (melanin-containing organelle) morphology and quantitatively measured hair colors from 116 extant mammals to reliably reconstruct the coloration of six Mesozoic mammaliaforms, including a previously undescribed euharamiyidan. Unlike the highly diverse melanosomes discovered in feathered dinosaurs, hairs in six mammaliaforms of different lineages and diverse ecomorphotypes showed uniform melanosome geometry, corresponding to dark-brown coloration consistent with crypsis and nocturnality. Our results suggest that the melanosome variation and color expansion seen in extant mammals may have occurred during their rapid radiation and diversification after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.},

For a variety of reasons, materials that are good piezoelectrics are electrical insulators or wide bandgap semiconductors. Huang et al . show that narrow bandgap semiconductors from the half-Heusler family can also have attractive piezoelectric properties. They found at least three lead-free compositions with good piezoelectric strain coefficients, even at high temperatures. The particular combination of properties make these materials good candidates for a different range of applications than traditional piezoelectrics. —Brent Grocholski Piezoelectricity is primarily observed in noncentrosymmetric insulators or wide bandgap semiconductors. We report the observation of the piezoelectric (PE) effect in half-Heusler (HH) narrow-bandgap semiconductors TiNiSn, ZrNiSn, and TiCoSb. These materials exhibit shear PE strain coefficients that reach ~38 and 33 picocoulombs per newton in ZrNiSn and TiCoSb, respectively, which are high values for noncentrosymmetric nonpolar materials. We demonstrated a TiCoSb-based PE sensor with a large voltage response and capable of charging a capacitor. The PE effect in HHs remains thermally stable up to 1173 kelvin, underscoring their potential for high-temperature applications. Our observations suggest that these HH narrow-bandgap semiconductors may find promising applications for advanced multifunctional technologies.},

  abstract     = {Along with the enormous costs to human life and livelihoods, war creates environmental catastrophes. In the ongoing war in Ukraine, dams have been the targets of military attacks, creating floods and severely diminishing water resources for agricultural irrigation. Shumilova et al . measured and modeled some of the less well-recognized environmental impacts of dam destruction, focusing on the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine. The destruction of the dam in June 2023 released pollutants that had accumulated in the reservoir sediments, creating a long-term source of contaminants that could be spread by future floods. Fast-growing riparian vegetation could help recover the floodplain of the former lake bed in the short term, but actions must be taken to address contamination in the region. —Bianca Lopez The use of water as a weapon in highly industrialized areas in the Russo-Ukrainian war has resulted in catastrophic economic and environmental damages. We analyze environmental effects caused by the military destruction of the Kakhovka Dam. We link field, remote sensing, and modeling data to demarcate the disaster’s spatial-temporal scales and outline trends in reestablishment of damaged ecosystems. Although media attention has focused on the immediate impacts of flooding on society, politics, and the economy, our results show that toxic contamination within newly exposed sediments of the former reservoir bed poses a largely overlooked long-term threat to freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. The continued use of water as a weapon may lead to even greater risks for people and the environment.},

  abstract     = {There is considerable interest in engineering chirality into semiconductor materials, with the goal of achieving high levels of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Currently, efficient organic light-emitting diode (OLED) systems use light-emitting molecules spatially isolated in a host, resulting in low levels of CPL. Previous attempts to build uniform chiral supramolecular order have not been compatible with optimized OLED device architectures. Chowdhury et al . found a way to fabricate thin, uniform films with chiral supramolecular nanostructures based on triazatruxene molecules. The method is fully compatible with OLED fabrication and demonstrated strong green CPL. This work opens new avenues for development in organic electronics driven by circularly polarized light. —Yury Suleymanov Current organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology uses light-emitting molecules in a molecular host. We report green circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in a chirally ordered supramolecular assembly, with 24% dissymmetry in a triazatruxene (TAT) system. We found that TAT assembled into helices with a pitch of six molecules, associating angular momentum to the valence and conduction bands and obtaining the observed CPL. Cosublimation of TAT as the “guest” in a structurally mismatched “host” enabled fabrication of thin films in which chiral crystallization was achieved in situ by thermally triggered nanophase segregation of dopant and host while preserving film integrity. The OLEDs showed external quantum efficiencies of up to 16% and electroluminescence dissymmetries ≥10%.

  abstract     = {One of the defining characteristics of aryl compounds such as benzene is their greater stability compared with other arrangements of carbon-carbon double bonds. If one of the aryl bonds is broken, those remaining tend to be more reactive. Olivier et al . report a reaction manifold that reverses this prevailing trend. A nitroarene reagent can be photoexcited to a state that preferentially reacts with arenes over olefins, likely through transient complexation, thereby enabling clean oxidative cleavage of just one aryl bond. —Jake S. Yeston The ozonolytic deconstruction of aromatics remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes.},

  abstract     = {The Asian tropics are among the world’s most diverse regions, encompassing four distinct biodiversity hotspots. Although previous studies have highlighted the complex biogeographic patterns in the region, they have been constrained by low spatial resolution, scarcity of genetic data, and conceptual frameworks that fail to account for within-region speciation. Accordingly, understanding of the biotic assembly (i.e., the contribution of dispersal versus speciation to species diversity) of these regions remains limited. On page 1204 of this issue, Kuhnhäuser et al . ( 1 ) describe reconstructing the evolutionary history of one of the most species-rich Asian palm lineages, the rattans and relatives (Arecaceae, Calamoideae). They develop a biogeographic framework with which to view biodiversity dynamics in the Asian tropics, with the potential to inform conservation priorities.},

  abstract     = {Dietary nutrients supply essential raw materials for cell growth and proliferation. Although a balanced diet promotes health, excess nutrients, such as carbohydrates and fats, can disrupt cellular processes, increasing the risk of diseases such as cancer. Determining how specific nutrients affect the cell growth machinery at the molecular level is vital to understanding the impacts of nutrition on human health. A key component of this machinery is the enzyme mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR partners with other proteins to form two distinct complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) that regulate various aspects of anabolic metabolism ( 1 ). Yet, how mTORCs sense nutrients, particularly lipids or fats, remains largely unexplored. On page 1164 of this issue, Koundouros et al . ( 2 ) report the mechanism by which mTORC1 senses omega-6 linoleic acid (ω-6 LA)—a dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)—providing clues on how specific cancers depend on this essential fat for tumor growth.},

  abstract     = {Naturally occurring obstacles in chromosomal DNA can challenge the faithful propagation of the genome across generations. Batra et al . determined that noncanonical DNA secondary structures called G-quadruplexes can impede DNA copying by arresting the replicative DNA helicase known as CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS), which serves as the central engine of the molecular machinery that copies chromosomal DNA. The CMG helicase moves along DNA through a previously unrecognized inchworm-like mechanism. These observations uncover fundamental principles of the chromosome replication process that are essential for the maintenance of genome stability. —Di Jiang DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non–B-form DNA secondary structures that threaten genome stability by impeding DNA replication. To elucidate how G4s induce replication fork arrest, we characterized fork collisions with preformed G4s in the parental DNA using reconstituted yeast and human replisomes. We demonstrate that a single G4 in the leading strand template is sufficient to stall replisomes by arresting the CMG helicase. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of stalled yeast and human CMG complexes reveal that the folded G4 is lodged inside the central CMG channel, arresting translocation. The G4 stabilizes the CMG at distinct translocation intermediates, suggesting an unprecedented helical inchworm mechanism for DNA translocation. These findings illuminate the eukaryotic replication fork mechanism under normal and perturbed conditions.},

Wei et al . found that that severe COVID-19 can disrupt peroxisomes in macrophages, an immune cell type specialized in engulfing cellular debris and pathogens. This disruption led to impaired lung repair, prolonged inflammation, and chronic fibrosis (see the Perspective by Sariol and Perlman). In mouse models, enhancing peroxisome function using an FDA-approved drug improved lung healing and reduced long-term damage after viral infection. Thus, targeting peroxisomes could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing acute and chronic complications caused by respiratory viruses. —Stella M. Hurtley Peroxisomes are vital but often overlooked metabolic organelles. We found that excessive interferon signaling remodeled macrophage peroxisomes. This loss of peroxisomes impaired inflammation resolution and lung repair during severe respiratory viral infections. Peroxisomes were found to modulate lipid metabolism and mitochondrial health in a macrophage type-specific manner and enhanced alveolar macrophage-mediated tissue repair and alveolar regeneration after viral infection. Peroxisomes also prevented excessive macrophage inflammasome activation and IL-1β release, limiting accumulation of KRT8 high dysplastic epithelial progenitors following viral injury. Pharmacologically enhancing peroxisome biogenesis mitigated both acute symptoms and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in animal models.

Kistler et al . sequenced the genomes of 200 herbarium samples, two archeological samples, and 80 modern samples of manioc to reconstruct its population history. Their analysis revealed that many lineages of manioc have been propagating for at least a century but with almost no geographical patterns of variation like their wild relatives. These patterns instead reflected local agricultural practices. By incorporating Indigenous knowledge, this study explores the impact of domestication on this crop and how this process is reflected in genetic variation. —Corinne Simonti Manioc—also called cassava and yuca—is among the world’s most important crops, originating in South America in the early Holocene. Domestication for its starchy roots involved a near-total shift from sexual to clonal propagation, and almost all manioc worldwide is now grown from stem cuttings. In this work, we analyze 573 new and published genomes, focusing on traditional varieties from the Americas and wild relatives from herbaria, to reveal the effects of this shift to clonality. We observe kinship over large distances, maintenance of high genetic diversity, intergenerational heterozygosity enrichment, and genomic mosaics of identity-by-descent haploblocks that connect all manioc worldwide. Interviews with Indigenous traditional farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado illuminate how traditional management strategies for sustaining, diversifying, and sharing the gene pool have shaped manioc diversity.},

Although they are essential for this decoding process, they are often viewed as identical particles with little regulatory influence.

They found that a protein called Lsg1 is involved in recruiting ribosomes near the endoplasmic reticulum to produce membrane-embedded proteins. They also found specialized ribosomes near mitochondria for making metabolism-related proteins and remodeling of ribosomal populations in neuronal processes, revealing a new layer of gene control based on ribosome type and location. —Di Jiang Millions of ribosomes are packed within mammalian cells, yet we lack tools to visualize them in toto and characterize their subcellular composition. In this study, we present ribosome expansion microscopy (RiboExM) to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique (ALIBi) to probe their composition. We generated a super-resolution ribosomal map, revealing subcellular translational hotspots and enrichment of 60 S subunits near polysomes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that Lsg1 tethers 60 S to the ER and regulates translation of select proteins. Additionally, we discovered ribosome heterogeneity at mitochondria guiding translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Lastly, we visualized ribosomes in neurons, revealing a dynamic switch between monosomes and polysomes in neuronal translation.

For example, a bacterial protein has been found that promotes beta cell proliferation in the islets of the pancreas of zebrafish. Hill et al . found that neonatal mice must be exposed to a microbiota during a particular developmental window to be able to develop functional pancreatic beta cells and islets. The fungal species Candida dubliniensis mediates this effect through islet macrophages, possible through fungal cell wall components. If the developmental window is missed (e.g., in germ-free mice) or if the microbiota are disrupted during the developmental window, there is reduced beta cell development and compromised metabolic function reverberates throughout the life of the animal. —Caroline Ash Loss of early-life microbial diversity is correlated with diabetes, yet mechanisms by which microbes influence disease remain elusive. We report a critical neonatal window in mice when microbiota disruption results in lifelong metabolic consequences stemming from reduced β cell development. We show evidence for the existence of a similar program in humans and identify specific fungi and bacteria that are sufficient for β cell growth. The microbiota also plays an important role in seeding islet-resident macrophages, and macrophage depletion during development reduces β cells. Candida dubliniensis increases β cells in a macrophage-dependent manner through distinctive cell wall composition and reduces murine diabetes incidence. Provision of C. dubliniensis after β cell ablation or antibiotic treatment improves β cell function. These data identify fungi as critical early-life commensals that promote long-term metabolic health.},

Two papers in this issue assess the degree to which plant species are tracking climate change in the American tropics, where data availability has constrained inference. Ramírez-Barahona et al . show that in Mesoamerican cloud forests, climate change and deforestation together have led to a mean upward shift in species ranges since 1979, mainly due to contracting lower range edges. In tropical forests across the Americas, Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al . found that tree traits are not shifting fast enough to track climate change based on trait-climate relationships, with smaller shifts in montane forests. —Bianca Lopez Understanding the capacity of forests to adapt to climate change is of pivotal importance for conservation science, yet this is still widely unknown. This knowledge gap is particularly acute in high-biodiversity tropical forests. Here, we examined how tropical forests of the Americas have shifted community trait composition in recent decades as a response to changes in climate. Based on historical trait-climate relationships, we found that, overall, the studied functional traits show shifts of less than 8% of what would be expected given the observed changes in climate. However, the recruit assemblage shows shifts of 21% relative to climate change expectation. The most diverse forests on Earth are changing in functional trait composition but at a rate that is fundamentally insufficient to track climate change.},

Here, we report the direct insertion of a nitrogen atom into unactivated carbon-carbon double bonds to access aza-allenium intermediates, which can be converted either into nitriles or amidine products, depending on the initial alkene substitution pattern. This operationally simple and highly functionally compatible reaction works on a wide range of unactivated alkenes. PIFA, a commercially available and inexpensive hypervalent iodine reagent, is key to this reactivity. Our mechanistic proposal is supported by chemical trapping experiments, which concomitantly demonstrate the utility of our method to access valuable N -heterocycles. Additionally, our method can be used as a general strategy for synthesizing amides and amines, as well as 15 N-labeled molecules.},

  abstract     = {Twisting and coiling polymer fibers has proven to be a simple method to create artificial muscles. Previous approaches have either used a self-coiling method, which is limited to muscles with a low spring index, or involve wrapping the fibers around a mandrel, which allows for high–spring index yarns, but the mandrel then needs to be extracted, generating excess waste. Zhang et al . managed to get rid of the mandrel by developing a process in which fibers are first twisted and then plied with other twisted fibers (see the Perspective by Zhang). After thermal stabilization, they are separated to produce coils from the original fibers. This process makes it possible to vary the spring index along the length of the fiber. The authors demonstrate the use of these polymer muscles for environmentally driven tunable insulation and in robotics through electrically driven actuation. —Marc S. Lavine Methods for making high-spring-index polymer fiber or yarn muscles have required expensive fabrication by wrapping around a mandrel, which limits their practical applications. We demonstrate an inexpensive mandrel-free method for making polymer muscles that can have a spring index of &gt;50 and a contractile tensile stroke exceeding 97%. This method enables the spring index to be varied along a muscle’s length by varying the plying twist, resulting in muscles that transition between homochiral and heterochiral when either heated or cooled. We demonstrate use of these polymer muscles for robots and environmentally driven comfort-adjusting jackets. This mandrel-free method was used to make high-spring-index carbon nanotube yarns for mechanical energy harvesters, self-powered strain sensors, and solvent-driven and electrochemically driven artificial muscles.},

Two-thirds of studied species showed declines of more than 10%. Many insects have the potential for rapid population growth and recovery, but habitat restoration, species-specific interventions, and reducing pesticide use are all likely needed to curb population declines. —Bianca Lopez Numerous declines have been documented across insect groups, and the potential consequences of insect losses are dire. Butterflies are the most surveyed insect taxa, yet analyses have been limited in geographic scale or rely on data from a single monitoring program. Using records of 12.6 million individual butterflies from &gt;76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programs, we characterized overall and species-specific butterfly abundance trends across the contiguous United States. Between 2000 and 2020, total butterfly abundance fell by 22% across the 554 recorded species. Species-level declines were widespread, with 13 times as many species declining as increasing.

THz-STM has been used in recent years to study ultrafast nanometer-scale dynamics induced by charge transfer on solid surfaces. However, there are still many challenges in improving spatiotemporal resolution. Kimura et al . successfully demonstrated ultrafast manipulation of exciton formation in a single phthalocyanine molecule on a metal-supported ultrathin insulating film by tailoring the waveform of THz pulses. The presented experimental platform is a promising step in studying exciton dynamics with single-molecule precision. —Yury Suleymanov The ultrafast manipulation of molecular states by charge transfer is essential for characterizing and controlling molecular dynamics. In this study, we demonstrated exciton formation in a single molecule through ultrafast electron tunneling processes between a molecule and a metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) using a phase-controlled terahertz (THz) pulse. The pronounced luminescence of the well-defined molecular system under the distinct carrier-envelope phase of the THz pulse revealed that sequential state-selective electron-tunneling processes to the frontier molecular orbitals promoted ultrafast exciton formation in the molecule at the STM junction. Furthermore, ultrafast control of exciton formation was achieved using phase- and delay-controlled THz pulse pairs, providing a route for the regulation of molecular dynamics and the emergence of new molecular functions.},

  abstract     = {Proteins are translated from messenger RNA (mRNA), and the levels of these biomolecules are often correlated for a given gene. However, this observation is at odds with the fact that many variants that alter gene expression do not alter protein levels. Cope et al . tested several phylogenetic models relating mRNA and protein levels in coupled transcriptomic and proteomic data from skin samples across 10 mammals. They found that evolution primarily acting on protein levels best fit the data, with gene expression driven to accommodate those optimal levels. These mRNA values did not match perfectly and are likely amplified due to post-transcriptional mechanisms such as translational efficiency or protein degradation. —Corinne Simonti The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundances is well-studied, but less is known about the evolutionary processes shaping their relationship. To address this, we derived a new phylogenetic model and applied it to multispecies mammalian data. Our analyses reveal (i) strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances over macroevolutionary time, (ii) mutations affecting mRNA abundances minimally impact protein abundances, (iii) mRNA abundances evolve under selection to align with protein abundances, and (iv) mRNA abundances adapt faster than protein abundances owing to greater mutational opportunity. These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression.},

Two papers in this issue assess the degree to which plant species are tracking climate change in the American tropics, where data availability has constrained inference. Ramírez-Barahona et al . show that in Mesoamerican cloud forests, climate change and deforestation together have led to a mean upward shift in species ranges since 1979, mainly due to contracting lower range edges. In tropical forests across the Americas, Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al . found that tree traits are not shifting fast enough to track climate change based on trait-climate relationships, with smaller shifts in montane forests. —Bianca Lopez Global change drives biodiversity shifts worldwide, but these shifts are poorly understood in highly diverse tropical regions. In tropical mountains, plants are mostly expected to migrate upslope in response to warming. To assess this, we analyze shifts in elevation ranges of species in Mesoamerican cloud forests using three decades of species’ occurrence records. Our findings reveal a mean upslope shift of 1.8 to 2.7 meters per year since 1979 driven by the upslope retreat of the less thermophilic montane species. These shifts are mostly accompanied by retreating lower and upper edges attributed to varying degrees of species’ exposure to deforestation and climate change. Our results highlight the vulnerability of cloud forests under global change and the urgency to increase monitoring of species’ responses.},

  abstract     = {A group of mineral compounds with a distinct crystalline structure, called perovskite, is a cost-effective alternative to conventional semiconductors. Solar cells based on perovskites continue to set new performance standards in sunlight-to-electricity conversion, achieving efficiencies that are comparable to those of established materials such as silicon ( 1 ). Perovskites in tandem with silicon have also shown higher power conversion efficiencies than that of a single material ( 2 ). However, long-term stability of perovskite solar cells remains a major hurdle because of the compounds’ sensitivity to factors such as heat and light-induced stress. On page 1069 of this issue, Li et al. ( 3 ) report that layers of graphene and polymer reinforce a perovskite film to reduce lightinduced structural distortion substantially. This, in addition to a recent study of Zai et al. ( 4 ) that reported perovskite stabilization with molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), shows how two-dimensional (2D) materials could move perovskite-based devices toward practical applications.},

The mechanisms that underlie PASC are not clear, but aberrant immune responses have been implicated. On page 1054 of this issue, Wei et al . ( 1 ) report dysfunction in alveolar macrophages—lung-resident immune cells involved in tissue repair—as a contributing factor to persistent lung pathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Loss of peroxisomes (organelles involved in oxidative reactions and metabolism) from these macrophages after infection in mice ( Mus musculus ) resulted in impaired regeneration of lung tissue and persistent fibrosis—scar tissue harmful to lung function. These findings elucidate the etiology of postviral lung disease and suggest avenues for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract     = {Humans rely on muscle coordination for essential functions such as movement, regulation of blood flow, and respiration. For a synthetic material to mimic biological muscle properties, it needs to generate sufficient mechanical force and deform across large lengths in response to external stimuli. A promising type of artificial muscle, called “coiled muscle,” has a substantial actuation range and power when heated. Constructed by coiling a twisted fiber often made of polymers, its functionality is determined by the spring index, which is the ratio of coil diameter to fiber diameter ( 1 ). Various synthetic materials with high spring indices have been developed ( 2 , 3 ), but these often require expensive fabrication methods. On page 1101 of this issue, Zhang et al. ( 4 ) report that simple plying of two or more twisted fibers produces a coiled muscle with a high spring index. This approach could lead to a cost-effective way to create artificial muscles at a large scale.},

However, the bright colors of butterflies are a source of delight that have captivated observers for centuries, enabling the collection of valuable data on butterfly diversity and abundance and making it possible to study long-term changes in butterfly communities. Studies combining historical records and citizen science data have reported large butterfly population declines in western Europe ( 1 ) and the western US ( 2 ). On page 1090 of this issue, Edwards et al . ( 3 ) report the assembly of the most comprehensive dataset of systematic, decades-long butterfly monitoring within the contiguous US. The study reveals a worrying decline in total butterfly abundance, the magnitude of which is in line with global estimates of insect declines ( 4 ).},
