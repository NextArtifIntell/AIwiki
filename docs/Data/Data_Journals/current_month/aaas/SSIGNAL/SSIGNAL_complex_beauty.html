  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) control many physiological processes and are important pharmacological targets. Luebbers et al. developed an optical biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that directly measures the endogenous activation of Gα i subunits in response to GPCR stimulation in both cell lines and mouse astrocytes. In a neuronal cell line, experiments with Gα i bONE-GO revealed that several neuropeptides classified as full agonists of opioid receptors instead behaved as partial agonists. Unlike biosensors typically used to measure GPCR activation, Gα i bONE-GO does not depend on exogenously expressed receptors or G proteins and can be deployed in many cell types using a single expression construct. —Annalisa M. VanHook The activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) by G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a mechanism broadly used by eukaryotes to transduce signals across the plasma membrane and a target for many clinical drugs. Many optical biosensors commonly used for measuring GPCR-stimulated G protein activity rely on exogenously expressed GPCRs and/or G proteins, which compromise readout fidelity. Biosensors that measure endogenous signaling may interfere with the signaling process under investigation or have a limited dynamic range of detection, hindering applicability. Here, we developed an optical BRET-based biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that detects endogenous GTP-bound (active) Gα i upon stimulation of endogenous GPCRs more robustly than existing sensors of endogenous activity. Its design leverages the Gα i -binding protein GINIP as a high-affinity and specific detector of Gα i -GTP. We optimized this design to prevent interference with downstream G i -dependent signaling and to enable implementation in different experimental systems having endogenous GPCRs, including adenosine receptors in primary astroglial cells and opioid receptors in cell lines. In a neuronal cell line, Gα i bONE-GO revealed activation profiles indicating that several natural opioid neuropeptides acted as partial agonists, in contrast with their characterization as full agonists using biosensors that depend on exogenously expressed receptors and G proteins. The Gα i bONE-GO biosensor is a direct and sensitive detector of endogenous activation of Gα i proteins by GPCRs in different experimental settings but does not interfere with the subsequent propagation of signaling.},

  abstract     = {Many cancers suppress immune surveillance and resist immune-targeted therapies. Chen et al. found that antitumor immunity and treatment might be improved by harnessing an antibody associated with the autoimmune disease lupus. The antibody, called 4H2, was taken up into cells where it bound to endogenous (“self”) RNA to recruit and activate the nucleic acid sensor cGAS, which initiated inflammatory signaling that was cytotoxic to brain, lung, and breast cancer cells in culture but not to normal breast epithelial cells. In mice with glioblastomas, 4H2 localized to the tumor microenvironment after systemic administration, improved animal survival in a T cell–dependent manner, and improved the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, demonstrating its potential for treating patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Nucleic acid–mediated signaling triggers an immune response that is believed to be central to the pathophysiology of autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we found that a cell-penetrating, SLE-associated antiguanosine autoantibody may present therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment. The autoantibody entered cells through a nucleoside salvage-linked pathway of membrane transit that avoids endosomes and lysosomes and bound to endogenous RNA in live cells. In orthotopic models of glioblastoma, the antibody localized to areas adjacent to necrotic tumor cells and promoted animal survival in a manner that depended on T cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that antibody binding to nucleic acids activated the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), thereby stimulating immune signaling and cGAS-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, the autoantibody could carry and deliver functional RNA into tumor, brain, and muscle tissues in live mice when administered locally. The findings establish a collaborative autoantibody–nucleic acid interaction that is translatable to strategies for nonviral gene delivery and immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Because the STAT family of transcriptional regulators induces the expression of genes involved in antiviral signaling, they are often targeted by viruses to suppress immune responses. Activation of STATs by tyrosine phosphorylation induces their dimerization, and STAT dimers can assemble into tetramers with different transcriptional properties. Sugiyama et al . solved the cryo-EM structure of a tetrameric form of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 in complex with DNA, showing how interactions between N-terminal domains of the protein supported the dimerization of STAT1 dimers. Biochemical analyses and modeling further indicated how the rabies virus P-protein specifically targets STAT1 tetramers, suggesting a potential mechanism of immune evasion. —John F. Foley Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members mediate signaling in the Janus kinase (JAK)–STAT pathway and are activated by phosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine residue, resulting in dimerization through reciprocal interactions between the phosphotyrosine and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT (pY-STAT) then translocates to the nucleus to induce the expression of genes encoding antiviral proteins. Although the active and functional forms of STATs are conventionally considered to be dimers, STATs can undergo higher-order oligomerization, which is implicated in regulating transcriptional activity. We present the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the tetrameric form of intact pY-STAT1 in complex with DNA, which indicates that interactions between the amino-terminal domains (NTDs) of STAT1 induce oligomerization. The tetrameric structure revealed a compact conformation with a previously uncharacterized binding interface: Two DNA-bound dimers are twofold symmetrically aligned to transform into a tandem DNA-binding model without NTD dimer separation. Moreover, biochemical analyses indicated that the rabies virus P-protein selectively targeted tetrameric pY-STAT1. Combined with data showing which regions contribute to the interaction between pY-STAT1 and the P-protein, we constructed a binding model explaining how P recognizes the pY-STAT1 tetramer. These data provide insight into how pathogenic viruses target signaling pathways that mediate the host immune response.},

  abstract     = {In prostate cancers, the abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4 is inversely correlated with response to the antiandrogen (also known as an androgen receptor inhibitor) enzalutamide. Zhang et al. found that PDCD4 is repressed by the mitotic kinase PLK1, which enabled the activity of cell survival pathways that are androgen independent. In prostate cancer cell lines, PLK1 promoted the degradation of PDCD4, which released a brake on c-MYC, stimulating its activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and metabolic pathways that reduced cellular dependence on androgen receptor signaling and thus reduced sensitivity to enzalutamide. Treatment with the Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib restored enzalutamide sensitivity in tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that this may be an effective strategy in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Enzalutamide, a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor (also known as an antiandrogen), is used to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Tumors often acquire resistance to enzalutamide. Tumor progression and enzalutamide resistance are associated with decreased abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4. In normal dividing cells, PDCD4 abundance is low when that of the kinase PLK1 is high. In this study, we found that PLK1 acted on PDCD4 to promote enzalutamide resistance in CRPC cells in culture and in mice via a mechanism that revealed an effective combination therapy. PLK1 phosphorylated PDCD4 at Ser 239 , leading to its degradation and consequently inducing the transcriptional activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by c-MYC. Hh signaling supports tumor cell proliferation and stemness by inducing the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15), which promotes the metabolic clearance of drugs and steroid hormones. Thus, this pathway may circumvent androgen receptor dependence, thereby reducing cellular sensitivity to enzalutamide. Knocking down UGT2B15 enhanced enzalutamide-induced cell apoptosis and growth arrest in a PDCD4-dependent manner. Combining enzalutamide with the clinically approved Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in enzalutamide-resistant cell cultures and xenografts in vivo. Our findings reveal a mechanism of PLK1-mediated enzalutamide resistance and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance in prostate cancer.},

The kinase ATM is a major initial response protein that facilitates the activation of other repair proteins. Alonso-Marañón et al. found that ATM complexes are directed to sites of damage by the protein NEMO, a regulatory subunit in the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway (see also the Focus by Perkins). In cells exposed to ultraviolet light or a chemotherapeutic, NEMO bound to ATM in complex with the NF-κB–associated protein IKKα and directed the complexes to damaged DNA to promote efficient repair. Increased expression of NEMO-encoding transcripts in colorectal cancers correlated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis, suggesting that NEMO may predict tumors that could be effectively treated with DNA repair inhibitors. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli The DNA damage repair kinase ATM is phosphorylated by the NF-κB pathway kinase IKKα, resulting in enhanced DNA damage repair through the nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Thus, inhibition of IKKα enhances the efficacy of cancer therapy based on inducing DNA damage. Here, we found a role for the IKK regulatory subunit NEMO in DNA damage repair mediated by ATM and IKKα. Exposure to damaging agents induced the interaction of NEMO with a preformed ATM-IKKα complex, which was required to target active ATM and IKKα to chromatin for efficient DNA damage repair but not for activating ATM. Recognition of damaged DNA by the IKKα-NEMO-ATM complex was facilitated by the interaction between NEMO and histones and depended on the ADP ribosylation of histones by the enzyme PARP1. NEMO-deficient cells showed increased activity of the kinase ATR, and inhibition of ATR potentiated the effect of chemotherapy in cells lacking NEMO or IKKα. Bioinformatic analysis of colorectal cancer datasets demonstrated that the expression of genes encoding IKKα, NEMO, and ATM correlated with poor patient prognosis, suggesting that the mechanism linking these three elements may be clinically relevant.},

Wang et al. investigated the role of the deacetylating enzyme sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) in adipose tissue macrophages in regulating norepinephrine amounts in brown adipose tissue. Obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet was exacerbated by SIRT6 deficiency in macrophages. SIRT6 decreased the promoter acetylation and expression of genes encoding a norepinephrine transporter and an enzyme that degrades norepinephrine. Thus, SIRT6 in macrophages prevents the degradation of norepinephrine, thereby ensuring the thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue and limiting obesity in mice. —Wei Wong Brown and beige adipocytes dissipate energy to generate heat through uncoupled respiration, and the hormone norepinephrine plays an important role in stimulating brown fat thermogenesis and beige adipocyte development in white adipose depots. Increasing energy expenditure by promoting the function and development of brown and beige fat is a potential approach to treat obesity and diabetes. Here, we investigated the effects of macrophage sirtuin 6 (SIRT6 ) on the regulation of the norepinephrine content of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and on obesity in mice. Myeloid SIRT6 deficiency impaired the thermogenic function of BAT, thereby decreasing core body temperatures because of reduced norepinephrine concentrations in BAT and subsequently leading to cold sensitivity. In addition, the oxygen consumption rate was reduced, resulting in severe insulin resistance and obesity. Furthermore, macrophage SIRT6 deficiency inhibited BAT thermogenesis after cold exposure or norepinephrine treatment and cold exposure–induced increases in markers of lipid metabolism and thermogenesis in white adipose tissue. Myeloid-specific SIRT6 deficiency promoted H3K9 acetylation in the promoter regions and the expression of genes encoding the norepinephrine-degrading enzyme MAOA and the norepinephrine transporter SLC6A2 in macrophages in BAT, leading to norepinephrine degradation and obesity.

Cho et al. found that GCN5 mediates inflammation in the brain as well, suggesting that it may be a target for treating neuroinflammatory diseases. In mice, inducing an innate immune response in the periphery (to mimic an infection) selectively increased the abundance of GCN5 in microglia in the brain. GCN5 acetylated a subunit of the transcription factor NF-κB, thus enabling its transcriptional activity and the production of inflammatory cytokines and associated proteins. Treating mice with GCN5 inhibitors prevented this response, suggesting that this approach may treat neuroinflammatory disease. —Leslie K.

Disrupted homeostasis of protein acetylation is implicated in neurodegeneration, and the lysine acetyltransferase GCN5 (also known as KAT2A) is implicated in peripheral inflammation. Here, we investigated whether GCN5 plays a role in neuroinflammation in the brain. Systemic administration of the bacterial molecule LPS in mice to induce peripheral inflammation increased the abundance of GCN5 in various organs, including in the brain and specifically in microglia. In response to LPS, GCN5 mediated the induction of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and the inflammatory mediators COX-2 and iNOS in microglia. Further investigation in cultured microglial cells revealed that GCN5 was activated downstream of the innate immune receptor TLR4 to acetylate Lys 310 in the NF-κB subunit p65, thereby enabling the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB and the resulting inflammatory response.
