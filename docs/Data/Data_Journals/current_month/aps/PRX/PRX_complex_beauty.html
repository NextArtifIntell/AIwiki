  abstract     = {We use nonlinear pump-probe spectroscopy to study optical excitations in a charge-tunable moiré heterostructure. An intense red-detuned laser pulse creates a photonic dressing of the material by introducing a large virtual population of excitons or exciton polarons in a deep moiré potential. By measuring the resulting ac Stark effect with a weak resonant laser pulse, we gain access to the nature and mutual interactions of the elementary optical excitations. At charge neutrality, our measurements reveal that different exciton resonances, associated with confinement of their center-of-mass motion in the moiré potential, have a significant spatial overlap. The resulting short-range interactions manifest themselves as a density-dependent blueshift for same-valley excitons and bound biexciton states for opposite-valley excitons. The attractive polaron resonance that appears upon injection of electrons into the heterostructure shows a contrasting behavior: Here, we observe an electron-density-independent light shift and a clear pump-power-dependent saturation. These features are equivalent to that of an ensemble of independent two-level emitters and indicate a breakdown of the Fermi-polaron picture for optical excitations of electrons subject to a strong moiré potential. Our work establishes an experimental approach to elucidate the elementary optical excitations of semiconductor moiré heterostructures, providing a solid ground for the spectroscopy of correlated electronic and excitonic states in such materials.},

  abstract     = {Electron-boson coupling in unconventional superconductors is one of the key parameters in understanding the superconducting pairing symmetry. Here, we report definitive photoemission evidence of electron-spin fluctuation coupling in the iron-based superconductor CaKFe 4 As 4 , obtained via high-resolution ARPES. Our study identifies a distinct kink structure on the α band, observable only in the superconducting phase and closely linked with the superconductivity, indicative of strong electron-boson interactions. Notably, this kink structure corresponds to two distinct bosonic modes at 11 meV and 13 meV, aligning with spin resonance modes previously observed in inelastic neutron-scattering experiments. This alignment underscores the significant role of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the pairing mechanism of this superconductor. Furthermore, the unique momentum-dependent and orbital-selective properties of the coupling revealed by ARPES provide profound insights into the pairing symmetry, suggesting predominantly s ± -wave pairing facilitated by spin fluctuations. Our findings not only highlight the pivotal role of spin resonance in the superconductivity of CaKFe 4 As 4 but also enhance our understanding of the electron-spin fluctuation interactions in unconventional superconductors.},
