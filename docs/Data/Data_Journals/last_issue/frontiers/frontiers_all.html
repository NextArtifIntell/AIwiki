  abstract     = {Recent advances in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) field have seen significant growth in the last couple of years. IoT is revolutionizing manufacturing, transportation, oil \&amp;amp; gas, and logistics sectors. However, developing IIoT applications poses several challenges, including the limited computational, memory, and energy resources of IoT devices. These devices generate a large amount of data at the network edge, making cloud-based processing impractical due to bandwidth constraints, latency, and security risks. Edge computing, which brings data processing closer to the source, offers a viable solution to these challenges. Despite its promise, edge computing faces significant hurdles. One of the primary challenges lies in the diversity of sensor types deployed across different environments, which adds complexity to the system&amp;#39;s architecture.Furthermore, the large-scale deployment of edge devices and the inherent resource constraints of these devices complicate the task of optimizing performance. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to address these issues, particularly in domains like robotics and natural language processing, where it helps optimize task allocation, improve decision-making processes, and enhance the overall efficiency of edge systems. This Research Topic features four articles that explore diverse and cutting-edge applications within the IIoT, including resource management and enhancing security in IoT systems. The first article, \textit{&amp;quot;An enhanced whale optimization algorithm for task scheduling in edge computing environments&amp;quot;} by \href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2024.1422546} {Han et al.}, focuses on addressing the challenges in real-time execution due to limited resources in edge computing environments. The authors proposed an enhanced whale optimization algorithm incorporating a multi-objective model considering CPU, memory, time, and resource utilization for optimizing task scheduling in edge computing. By leveraging chaotic mapping and a nonlinear convergence factor, the algorithm balances local and global search, significantly reducing costs (by 29.22\%), completion time (by 17.04\%), and improving resource utilization (by 9.5\%). This work significantly addresses the increasing demand for real-time processing capabilities in resource-constrained edge environments.The second contribution is the comprehensive review titled \textit {&amp;quot;Unveiling the core of IoT: comprehensive review on data security challenges and mitigation strategies&amp;quot;} by \href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2024.1420680}{Kaur et al.}, which examines the security challenges posed by the increasing complexity of IoT environments. The authors identified key security threats, including spoofing, distributed denial of service, and man-in-the-middle attacks. This paper reviews various mitigation strategies such as machine learning, deep learning, lightweight encryption, intrusion detection systems, and advanced security protocols. The evaluation of IoT technology, the accompanying security progress, and the need for continued development are discussed. The paper also identifies IoT&amp;#39;s application areas, such as healthcare, smart cities, smart homes, and industrial IoT, highlighting specific security challenges each faces. This review provides valuable insights into current vulnerabilities and presents strategies that could significantly enhance the resilience and security of IIoT systems. In the third article, \textit {&amp;quot;&amp;#39;Below 58 BPM,&amp;#39; involving real-time monitoring and self-medication practices in music performance through IoT technology&amp;quot;} by \href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2024.1187933}{Merendino et al.}, the authors explored the development of an Internet of Musical Things system designed to assist an opera singer with a carotid aneurysm during performances. This system monitors the singer&amp;#39;s heart rate in real-time and promotes self-healing by providing non-intrusive feedback. The project combined healthcare and performance arts to help the singer manage stress. The system is an example of &amp;quot;inclusive design,&amp;quot; presenting a model for integrating assistive technology into arts. The project focuses on accessibility and environmental sustainability, and the results showed it could potentially reduce heart rate peaks during performances. Finally, the fourth article, \textit {&amp;quot;GPS-free synchronized pseudo-random number generators for internet-of-things&amp;quot;} by \href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2023.1157629}{Rahman and Chakrabartty (2023)} introduces a security solution to IoT device&amp;#39;s wireless communication without relying on GPS. The conventional random number generator (RNG) based approach is unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT devices due to their limited energy and computational capabilities. The authors propose an architecture utilizing a synchronized pseudo-random number generator (SPRNG) that combines a fast linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR)-based PRNG with a secure seed generator using self-powered timers. These timers operate based on quantum-mechanical tunneling, making them tamper-resistant and able to provide dynamic seeds that enhance the randomness of the output. The SPRNG system facilitates the secure exchange of encryption keys between IoT devices using synchronized timers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology conducted the random number tests and validated this approach. This approach is suitable for use in resource-constrained and adversarial environments, with potential applications ranging from healthcare to military-grade IoT systems.The research presented in this topic drives advancements in IIoT across various industries. From task scheduling and security to real-time monitoring and secure communication, the articles exemplify the breadth of research addressing critical challenges in the field. By providing solutions that improve efficiency, enhance security, and address domain-specific needs, this Research Topic lays the groundwork for future innovations that will further transform IIoT systems.},

  abstract     = {Whereas the Research Topic title explicitly refers to healthcare innovation, the broader scope has turned this article collection into an opportunity for reflection on a range of topics of relevance to both health and wellbeing. Topics have included machine learning and immersive technologies for enhancing the provision of medical education and training, for improving workforce wellbeing, and for augmenting art therapy programmes with a view to increasing therapeutic compliance. Methods employed include Agile data science techniques, &amp;#39;CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining&amp;#39; (CRISP-SM), &amp;#39;Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses&amp;#39; (PRISMA), thematic literature review, mini review, primary research (specifically, collection of data from university nursing students and surgeons), &amp;#39;Simulation Effectiveness Tool -Modified&amp;#39; (SET-M), established data science techniques, and human factors engineering methods. Key research themes that have emerged from the Research Topic are discussed below, followed by a reflection on priorities for further research and development.The articles have highlighted a need for knowledge and expertise from across academic disciplines and professional practice to converge and underpin the development of digital innovations promoting individuals&amp;#39; health and wellbeing. Relevant disciplines and domains include computer science, user-centred design, human-computer interaction, engineering, human factors engineering, and the social sciences. Technology end user and stakeholder values, expectations, and requirements need to be addressed if new methods enabled by modern digital technologies are to be sustainably employed [1][2][3][4]. Interestingly, the articles have generally suggested the importance of embedding end user and stakeholder perspectives within technology development workflows, although only a minority of the studies have explicitly articulated the need for extensive involvement of humancentred design researchers and practitioners for scaffolding and facilitating iterative development and evaluation [3]. Unsurprisingly, the need to address ethical concerns appears intertwined with the recognised desirability of research objectives and methods to deliver deeper integration across discipline boundaries. This is illustrated by research advocating the adoption of intersectional social sciences perspectives within AI development for cancer diagnostics [2] and by studies focussing on the representativity of machine learning training data to reduce health inequalities affecting specific ethnic groups in relation the provision of diagnostic services [3].The design and development of production-ready AI-based systems designed for flexibility and maintainability over time have received significant attention in recent years, particularly in the information systems, human-computer interaction, and engineering design literature. This is illustrated by Research Topic articles focussing on the definition of architectural requirements for healthcare cost estimation systems relying on dedicated predictive numerical models [5], and by studies delivering prototype models to enable healthcare professionals to query different Electronic Medical Record systems using intuitive interfaces based on natural language [6]. Such efforts have achieved a balance between adapting research pipelines for production environments and identifying optimised architectural specifications from an information systems perspective.The emphasis in recent academic and professional discourse on opportunities afforded by immersive technologies, including virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, for achieving more efficient and inclusive delivery of medical educational and training programmes is reflected in this article collection. An interesting review study has focussed on a comparison between technologyaugmented methods and established approaches [7]. Reported benefits include enhanced student and trainee motivation, satisfaction, and learning outcomes, although the possible occurrence of undesired consequences of the use of immersive technologies, including cybersickness following prolonged exposure, has been noted. Interestingly, one study has focussed on real-time detection of cybersickness with a view to reducing detrimental effects on user experience [8]. Proposed innovations based on mixed reality to streamline urology anatomy training and to facilitate preoperative urology planning have attracted positive feedback from both university nursing students and surgeons, which encourages further research towards more extensive clinical validation [9]. An interesting study has focussed on an integration between generative AI and immersive technologies for designing augmented reality filters, with a view to improving medical students&amp;#39; perceptions of self-efficacy in recognising selected disease manifestations [10].The potential of modern digital technologies for improving individuals&amp;#39; wellbeing has been the subject of recent research, which is reflected in this article collection. The breadth of contributions received illustrates the potential of artificial intelligence and immersive technologies for improving individuals&amp;#39; wellbeing, particularly in clinical and workplace settings. A theoretical model has been presented, explaining the psychological benefits of virtual immersion for oncology patients with emphasis on distraction for alleviating anxiety and pain [4]. Opportunities have been identified for artistic expression within virtual reality environments to increase therapeutic compliance and to improve wellbeing outcomes for individuals in relation to psychotherapy and neurorehabilitation [11]. A study has identified features of immersive technologies that hold potential for improving motor rehabilitation compliance and efficacy with stroke patients when used in combination with traditional approaches [12]. Such features include those enabling real-time movement tracking and the provision of reinforced feedback in line with established neurorehabilitation principles. A review of modern digital technologies for estimating individuals&amp;#39; wellbeing in workplace settings has generated useful recommendations on how real-time posture detection is best combined with the adoption of established human factors engineering best practices [13]. This has enabled the identification of optimised algorithms to be employed in conjunction with physiological sensing methods towards the design of healthier workplaces.Overall, the articles published under this Research Topic have highlighted the importance of conducting interdisciplinary research when tackling challenges at the intersection of technology development with human-centred design and human factors engineering. Integrative capabilities across academic discipline silos and research methodologies -with emphasis on modern design research and design professional practice -have identified as an important enabler of challenge-driven research and responsible innovation. Such insights are relevant to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 3 (&amp;#39;Good health and well-being&amp;#39;) and more broadly [14]. A balanced distribution has been achieved in this collection of articles between applications of immersive technologies [4;7-9;10-12] and applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence [1-3;5-6;8]. The authors speculate that future research is likely to reflect a convergence of immersive technologies and artificial intelligence in relation to the promotion of individuals&amp;#39; health and wellbeing. If that is the case, it is anticipated that the emphasis will be on human-centred design, participatory design, and methods addressing ethical issues of privacy, transparency, equitability, and fairness. One potential area of convergence relates to the development of personalised immersive experiences designed for inclusivity. It is expected that reliance on human-centred and participatory design methods will prove useful for scaffolding iterative design with significant involvement of technology end users and stakeholders. This is illustrated by the article discussing the use of artistic experiences within virtual reality environments to increase therapeutic compliance and to improve wellbeing outcomes [11]. The articles have also highlighted several limitations with the technology state of the art, which calls for additional emphasis on interdisciplinary research, human-centred design, and inclusive design research moving forward. Such limitations include the following: digital access barriers and reduced digital literacy across user groups; the generally reduced availability of dedicated features for visually-impaired individuals --and for individuals with specific characteristics more broadly -compared with mainstream users; undesired effects from the use of head-mounted immersive displays --including cybersickness; the presence of different skill sets within interdisciplinary AI development teams, potentially reducing the benefits of Agile development. Moreover, although the articles published under this Research Topic have not focussed on this aspect, future development will also need to address elements of clinical validation of digital technologies in the context of the relevant regulatory frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Visualizing big, multi-sourced data of the past is not simply a technical challenge, it is an intellectual and 10 interpretive one. While early efforts in digital humanities focused on digitizing and representing discrete 11 collections, the growing complexity of the field manifests in projects going beyond individual datasets.12 Nowadays, scholars connect local case studies, create contextual linkages, and connect microhistorical 13 details to macrohistorical frameworks, as seen in large-scale initiatives such as the European Data Space The visualization of cultural and historical data also raises ethical questions. Visualizations are not 27 neutral; they reflect the decisions, biases, and goals of both their creators and the initial data collectors.They foreground certain perspectives and narratives, obscuring others, and play a major role in shaping 29 how audiences (scholars, students, and the public) engage with the past. This makes visualization design 30 not just a technical endeavor but also a deeply critical and reflective one.This special issue explores these intersections of technology, theory, and interpretation. It showcases 32 pioneering works combining humanities scholarship with computational methods and visualization to 33 uncover patterns, connections, and narratives within complex cultural datasets. Together, they offer insights 34 into how the field can reshape the ways we study, share, and understand cultural and historical knowledge.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {In recent years, the concept of universal basic income (UBI) has gained significant attention, not from grassroots community organizations traditionally associated with social welfare advocacy (Jarow, 2023), but from some of the most powerful figures in the technology sector-AI tycoons elites (Shead, 2021). Prominent advocates like Elon Musk and Sam Altman argue that UBI is necessary to address the economic disruptions caused by artificial intelligence (AI) and automation (Crumley, 2024). They present UBI as a way to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed across society, not just concentrated in the hands of a few. However, this seemingly benevolent narrative camouflages a deeper agenda: to seek out a social license to gain public acceptance for the omnipresence of AI in society, and the will to control under the guise of universal benefit.While economic, social, and normative analyses have been put forward in articles in Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence (Ernst, 2022;Huo et al., 2024;Merola, 2022), two key dimensions that remain underexplored in the UBI discussion are 1) the utilitarian calculation behind the AI-justified UBI narrative;, and 2) the associated concept of symbolic violence, as articulated by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. I argue that UBI, while ostensibly a tool for social good, can may end up justifying even greater disparities in wealth and may entrench symbolic violence by reinforcing divisions between AI owners, those skilled or capacitated in using AI, and those who are merely recipients of its &amp;quot;benefits.&amp;quot; This symbolic violence is particularly perverse as it perpetuates a narrative of AI as universally beneficial, when in reality, it risks exacerbating socio-economic inequalities and creating profound epistemic and symbolic injustices.The advocacy for UBI by AI tycoons elites is a relatively new phenomenon. Figures like Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and X, and Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, have positioned themselves as champions of UBI. Musk (2024) recently indicated about the rise of AI that &amp;quot;In a benign scenario, probably none of us will have a job. There would be universal high income. There would be no shortage of goods and services. The question will really be one of meaning: if a computer can do, and the robots can do, everything better than you, does your life have meaning? I do think there&amp;#39;s perhaps still a role for humans in that we may give AI meaning.&amp;quot; For his part, Altman (2016) indicated that &amp;quot;[he&amp;#39;s] fairly confident that at some point in the future, as technology continues to eliminate traditional jobs and massive new wealth gets created, we&amp;#39;re going to see some version of this at a national scale.&amp;quot; AI Tycoons elites argue that as AI and automation increasingly replace human labor, UBI will be essential to prevent widespread economic dislocation and social unrest. This argument may be compelling, especially in a world where technological advancements threaten to render large segments of the workforce obsolete (Islam, 2024). However, the promotion of UBI by these tech magnates is not simply a philanthropic gesture; it is deeply intertwined with their interests in the expansion and dominance of AI technologies. Crane et al (2019) argue that corporate strategies often align with maintaining and enhancing power structures that benefit corporate elites. The advocacy for UBI by AI leaders can be seen as a strategic move to preemptively address potential backlash against AI-induced risk and negative externalities, such as job losses or job polarization (i.e., reducing middle wages, shifting demand towards low and high wages, see Goos and Savona (2024)), thereby securing a favorable business environment for continued AI development and deployment.Without going so far as to say that AI may be an existential risk (or X-Risk, a risk to the very viability of humanity)-as other movements such as the members of the effective altruism movement and the associated cause of longtermism may do (Jecker et al., 2024)-AI may pose significant economic and social risks if job losses are not offset. The narrative presented by these AI leaders suggests that UBI is a necessary adaptation to the inevitable rise of AI-a tool to ensure that everyone benefits from technological progress. Yet, this narrative serves to legitimize and reinforce the power dynamics that already exist in the AI industry. By advocating for UBI, these tycoons AI elites position themselves as benevolent visionaries who are concerned about the well-being of humanity. However, as Sadowski (2016) argues, promoting UBI can be a strategic way for AI elites to deflect criticism, maintaining control over narratives about AI&amp;#39;s future while avoiding challenges to their profit motives. This framing distracts from the fact that the same individuals who are pushing for UBI are also those who stand to gain the most from the proliferation of AI technologies (Spencer, 2024). Bourdieu&amp;#39;s concept of symbolic violence offers valuable insight into the deeper implications of UBI in the context of AI; however, it is important first to examine UBI from its utilitarian foundation.It is here that Bourdieu&amp;#39;s concept of symbolic violence becomes crucial for understanding the true implications of UBI in the age of AI.This narrative aligns with a utilitarian view for assessing the benefits and risks of AI in society. AI tycoons elites apply a utilitarian calculation , evaluating the moral justification of replacing humans with AIs by weighing the potential to maximize societal well-being against the associated harms. From this eudemonic standpoint-focused on balancing well-being and harm, or even more simply pleasures and pains-they envision a future where AI&amp;#39;s dominance across human-dominated fields leads to a society characterized by widespread leisure and, for some, heightened performance. In their view, this transformation is morally defensible if measures (such as UBI) are implemented to mitigate the negative effects and ensure distribution of certain benefits for allas they cast the replacing humans with AIs from a eudemonic standpoint (i.e., weighing up pleasures and pains). This allows them to arrive at a vision of the world where, despite AI&amp;#39;s pervasive advances in fields dominated by humans, considering that this will result in a society of leisure (and, for a minority, of performance), then the calculation is worth the candle if subsidies (in the form of UBI) can be distributed to all. UBI is thus used to justify the possibility, and to demonstrate, that AI can provide for humanity&amp;#39;s basic needs, while at the same time justifying that some can be ultra-wealthy and possess these technological tools of humanity&amp;#39;s (apparent) sustenance (Islam, 2024). While it has not been directly invoked up to now, this is a curious application of John Rawls&amp;#39; principle of difference, which in his &amp;quot;Theory of Justice&amp;quot; states that social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society, consistent with the just savings principle and the principle of fair equality of opportunity (Rawls, 1971). Arguably, providing UBI to all does not solve everything; it creates more equality amongst the less well-off, without acting to address inequalities and wealth gaps. Yes, this would be a first for humanity-an economic safe net from which all could benefit (which appears to be of a fixedbenefit nature, with no indication of adjustment to economic trends)-but this cannot justify the kind of leanness in which it seems to place the non-owners of AI (i.e., virtually the entire world population) compared to the AI tycoonselites. It is hard to make a convincing utilitarian claim that this is for the benefit of the less well-off. Furthermore, as Sen (2009) argues, a focus on utility maximization may neglect the distribution of capabilities and freedoms, which are essential for genuine social justice; something very plausible if like Musk (2024) is thinking that if &amp;quot;[computers and robots can be doing] everything better than [humans], does [human] life have meaning?&amp;quot; With AI potentially representing a X-risk (Jecker et al., 2024) or at the very least risking to lead to a &amp;quot;a shift in power towards actors with the capital and authority to deploy powerful AI systems, such as elites, corporations, and governments&amp;quot; (Dafoe, 2018), it is very unclear that AI will actually maximize utility and be for everyone&amp;#39;s benefits.Unfortunately for AI-justified UBI proponents, a study funded by Altman has found that UBI is not a comprehensive solution to the economic challenges posed by AI-driven job loss (Ropek, 2024). The research, conducted by OpenResearch (2024) between 2020 and 2023, provided $1,000 a month to 1,000 low-income individuals, with a control group receiving $50 monthly. While UBI helped participants cover essential expenses like housing and groceries, it did not lead to significant improvements in employment quality, education, or overall health. The study concluded that while UBI can alleviate some immediate financial stress, it falls short of addressing deeper systemic issues such as healthcare access, job stability, and upward mobility. Thus, UBI alone is unlikely to mitigate the broader economic impacts of AI on the workforce. So, unfortunately, proponents&amp;#39; utilitarian calculation does not seem to be working as well as they would like. As a result, the impetus for supporting UBI seems more ideological and self-serving than beneficial.Here, Pierre Bourdieu&amp;#39;s concept of &amp;quot;violence symbolique&amp;quot; can help deceive that AI elites&amp;#39; benevolent narrative. Symbolic violence, as this refers to a form of domination that is subtle and often imperceptible, yet profoundly effective in maintaining social hierarchies (Bourdieu &amp;amp; Wacquant, 1992). Symbolic violence operates through the imposition of meanings that are accepted as legitimate, even by those who are subordinated by them (Bourdieu, 1993). This form of violence is not physical, but it is deeply embedded in the social structures and cultural norms that shape our understanding of the world. With society&amp;#39;s increased digitalization, Couldry and Mejias (2020) denote how data practices can constitute a new form of colonialism, reinforcing existing power structures through symbolic means. It is throughSuch symbolic violence that allows dominant groups can perpetuate their power without overt coercion, by making their worldview appear natural and inevitable.In the context of UBI and AI, symbolic violence manifests in the way that the narrative of AI, as a universal good, is constructed and disseminated. The AI tycoons&amp;#39; elites&amp;#39; promotion of UBI suggests that the best way to address the disruptions caused by AI is to provide people with a guaranteed basic income, thereby ensuring that everyone benefits from technological progress. However, this narrative obscures the deeper structural inequalities that are being reinforced by the same technologies that UBI is supposed to mitigate. Symbolic violence, Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992, p. 172) notes, &amp;quot;accomplishes itself through an act of cognition and of misrecognition that lies beyond-or beneath-the controls of consciousness and will.&amp;quot; In the case of AI-justified UBI, public&amp;#39;s acceptance of this proposal as a universal good would be a form of misrecognition that a symbolic violence is being perpetrated and instead considering that AI and UBI is are something normal and rather logical natural within the existing social order. This Such acceptance would be a legitimization of the power of the AI elite by presenting them UBI as the solution to the very problems their technologies create, thus reinforcing the existing social order.UBI, as promoted by AI tycoonselites, can be seen as a tool of symbolic violence in several ways. First, it reinforces the division between those who own and control AI technologies and those who are merely consumers of its benefits. The owners of AI-who are also the primary advocates of UBI-are positioned as the benevolent providers of a safety net for the masses. Meanwhile, the recipients of UBI are cast as passive beneficiaries of a system that they have little control over. This dynamic perpetuates the power of the AI elite, while simultaneously legitimizing their dominance by presenting them as the solution to the very problems that their technologies create.Moreover, UBI as a form of symbolic violence operates by masking the true nature of the inequalities that it purportedly seeks to address. By providing a basic income, the narrative suggests that the economic and social disruptions caused by AI can be managed and mitigated. However, this narrative ignores the fact that UBI does nothing to address the underlying power imbalances that give rise to these disruptions in the first place. Critics argue that UBI, without accompanying structural reforms, may fail to address underlying inequalities (Parijs &amp;amp; Vanderborght, 2017), just like the OpenResearch study hinted. As Jarow (2024) puts it, &amp;quot;hitching the case for basic income to fears of rapid AI progress makes it far more vulnerable than it needs to be.&amp;quot; By linking UBI to AI, its advocates risk creating a policy that merely manages the symptoms of economic inequality without addressing the root causes. This approach perpetuates a superficial solution that maintains the status quo, allowing the AI elite to continue accumulating wealth and power while the majority remains dependent on the systems that marginalize them.The symbolic violence inherent in the promotion of UBI by AI tycoons elites is particularly perverse because it creates the illusion of inclusivity and fairness; (in an interesting way, values that are quite central to AI ethics (Victor et al., 2024)). The narrative of UBI as a universal good suggests that everyone stands to gain from the increased presence of AI in our societies. However, this narrative obscures the fact that the benefits of AI are not distributed equally, and that UBI, as currently envisioned, may actually entrench existing inequalities rather than alleviate them. By framing UBI as a necessary response to AI-induced unemployment, the AI tycoons elites are effectively shifting the focus away from the need for more equitable distribution of power and resources. The symbolic violence here lies in the way that UBI is presented as a panacea for the problems caused by AI, when in reality, it serves to reinforce the existing social order. Those who control AI technologies continue to benefit disproportionately, while those who are displaced dispossessed by these technologies are offered only a minimal safety net in return.Moreover, this symbolic violence has epistemic implications (Bourdieu, 1993), as it shapes our understanding of what is possible and desirable in a world increasingly dominated by AI. Musk (2016), almost a decade ago, said that &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation. I&amp;#39;m not sure what else one would do. I think that is what would happen. People will have time to do other things, more complex things, more interesting things. Certainly more leisure time.&amp;quot; The promotion of UBI by AI tycoons elites reinforces the idea that the best we can hope for is an AI-induced universal income, rather than a more radical rethinking of how wealth and power are distributed in society-nor seeing UBI as a way to enhancing people&amp;#39;s capabilities (Endo &amp;amp; Choi, 2024). The loss of meaningful work can have profound psychological effects, as Jahoda (1982) highlights the role of employment in providing structure, social contacts, and a sense of purpose. Rubin (2024) presents it nicely in indicating that &amp;quot;The AI revolution is accentuating the flow of income and power to the owners of property, leaving a new class-the precariat-wallowing in insecurity and existential fear.&amp;quot; Or as Jarow ( 2024) puts it &amp;quot;The basic income movement might be better off severing ties with speculations about AI altogether. Then, the conversation could focus on what basic income can actually be: an effective anti-poverty tool that would neither stave off dystopia nor usher in a leisurely paradise, but instead, just a world with less poverty.&amp;quot; AI-justified UBI&amp;#39;s narrative acts as symbolic violence and limits our collective imagination, making it harder to envision alternative futures where technology actually serves the common good rather than aiming to place populations in a state of indigence compared to the fortunes of those who control AI.Universal Basic Income, as promoted by AI tycoonselites, is not the straightforward solution to the disruptions caused by AI that it is often portrayed to be. Instead, it can be understood as a form of symbolic violence that reinforces existing power dynamics and socio-economic inequalities. Or as Bourdieu would put it, those in power &amp;quot;tend to seek social respectability&amp;quot; (Bourdieu &amp;amp; Passeron, 1970) and this can be achieved through the imposition of narratives and meanings presented as legitimate while concealing the power relations which are the basis of their force (Bourdieu, 1987). By presenting UBI as a benevolent response to AI-induced unemployment, the AI elite mask their own role in creating the very problems that UBI is supposed to solve. In doing so, they perpetuate a narrative that benefits them while marginalizing those who are most negatively affected by the rise of AI. Interestingly, what is being distributed is a basic economic safety net, without committing to providing basic and free access to AI itself. Recent statements by OpenAI suggested that free AI models may not be here to stay. The current idea is a freemium model with advertising to better monetize the models, development costs, and hosting (FT News Briefing, 2024). Dayan et al. (2024) demonstrated that older AI models tend to experience performance degradation over time, which, although the term &amp;quot;dementia&amp;quot; anthropomorphizes AI, effectively illustrates the decline of these models. Therefore, offering (un)restricted access to older AI models is not a viable solution to share more broadly the benefits of AI or promote computational justice. This is especially true since making such models widely available may not ensure equitable access, particularly when those who can afford newer models receive them significantly earlier than others.However, what is touted as benefits falls short of addressing structural inequities or advancing computational justice, which goes beyond mere access to AI. Computational justice emphasizes equitable access, representation, and outcomes in AI, ensuring that everyone-regardless of socioeconomic status or geography-can not only use AI but also participate in its development and governance. It requires addressing biases in algorithms, democratizing computational power (so actively supporting computational justice), and ensuring transparent, ethical governance. Such an approach could empower marginalized communities and provide tools to tackle systemic inequities. Instead, these economic models appear more focused on sustaining AI&amp;#39;s pervasive presence in everyday life, potentially prioritizing corporate profit over the transformative potential of AI to create a more equitable digital society both economically for all and in making the AI tools accessible for all. By sidelining these principles, the freemium model risks cementing existing inequalities rather than challenging them, raising concerns about whether the AI-driven future will be one of inclusion or exploitation. this will lead to a state where people will receive a UBI as a justification for the increased presence of AIs in society and to compensate for the externalities this induces, then will either have to pay for the advanced models or watch advertising to access the basic models. To truly address the societal disruptions posed by AI, structural reforms are necessary, including policies that promote equitable distribution of wealth and power (Stiglitz, 2019). To truly address the societal disruptions posed by AI, s This framing of UBI as a panacea for AI-induced challenges reflects a broader strategy by AI elites to deflect criticism and maintain control over narratives about AI&amp;#39;s future. As Schiff (2023) argues, the ethical aspirations embedded in AI policy often fall short in their translation to actionable solutions due to challenges like technical feasibility, value acceptability, and institutional constraints. By focusing on symbolic solutions like UBI, which align with their profit motives, AI elites can sidestep calls for deeper structural reforms that would redistribute wealth or power. Ethical principles, while rhetorically emphasized, are often narrowed or deprioritized when translated into sector-specific policies, reflecting institutional limitations and a preference for technical fixes over transformative socio-political solutions. This narrowing of ethical commitments not only limits meaningful progress but also exacerbates the phenomenon of AI ethics dumping, where ethical responsibilities are shifted from developers and regulators onto ill-equipped users and local communities (B&amp;#233;lisle-Pipon &amp;amp; Victor, 2024). AI-driven UBI serves as a key example of how symbolic solutions allow AI elites to divert attention from their complicity in creating structural inequalities. It enables them to project a narrative of benevolence while avoiding substantive changes that would challenge their profit motives or operational frameworks. Ethics dumping is particularly insidious in this context because it disguises systemic inequities under ethical innovation. Developers embed normative assumptions into AI systems, and high-level ethical guidelines fail to account for local contexts, leaving the most vulnerable communities to grapple with the downstream impacts of these technologies. The promotion of UBI thus reinforces a cycle where the burdens of AI-induced disruptions are offloaded onto those least equipped to address them, all while AI elites continue to benefit from an unchallenged status quo.Furthermore, UBI as a mitigating mechanism remains predominantly confined to the United States-or more specifically, to key regions where AI development and control are concentrated among AI elites-while failing to extend its scope to the global population. This narrow framing is highly problematic given that AI systems are trained on data sourced from diverse global populations and have profound, far-reaching effects not only on humanity as a whole but also on the environment (Crawford, 2021). Framing the benefits of AI within the privileged contexts of already-advantaged nations disregards the inequitable realities of the Global North and Global South divide (Birhane, 2021;Mohamed et al., 2020), particularly from the perspective of an AIdriven UBI. Such an exclusionary focus not only marginalizes billions of individuals who contribute to the ecosystems enabling AI but also underscores a critical flaw in the utilitarian logic underpinning the justification for AI development. The omission of global equity considerations exposes the ethical limitations of benefit-sharing mechanisms like UBI, raising serious questions about the moral defensibility of AI&amp;#39;s promised benefits and the structural inequities they perpetuate.uperficial solutions offered by AI-funded UBI should not be touted as quick fixes to the deeper structural inequalities that underlie current increasingly automated world.Tackling the issues surrounding AI governance requires embedding ethical principles into practical frameworks that consider the broader socio-political context of technological innovation (B&amp;#233;lisle-Pipon et al., 2022). Policymakers must move beyond symbolic gestures, such as Universal Basic Income (UBI), and instead focus on participatory decision-making, context-specific solutions, and robust accountability mechanisms. These measures must seek to dismantle the structural inequalities perpetuated by prevailing AI narratives, ensuring that technological progress is guided by principles of justice and equity rather than being wielded as a tool for consolidating power and profit. The expanding influence of tech elites in governmental and political spheres, exemplified by figures like Elon Musk&amp;#39;s involvement in federal policymaking and Sam Altman&amp;#39;s forays into municipal politics, highlights a calculated effort to control AI&amp;#39;s development and its societal implications. This trend aligns with concerns over an impending &amp;quot;AI regulation winter&amp;quot; (B&amp;#233;lisle-Pipon, 2024) scenario in which regulatory mechanisms are intentionally weakened to serve elite interests, further entrenching their dominance. This pervasive involvement across federal, municipal, and regulatory levels underscores a systematic strategy to shape society&amp;#39;s future in ways that prioritize private power over public good.In this context, UBI risks becoming a superficial concession-a mechanism for placating the public while masking deeper systemic inequities. As such, it can function as a form of symbolic violence that reinforces structural injustices rather than addressing them. Framed merely as a token redistribution of wealth, UBI has the potential to serve as a veneer of reform, obscuring the underlying exploitation and inequity facilitated by unchecked AI expansion and aggravated computational injustices. Policymakers must reject deregulation or the outsourcing of AI governance to elites whose primary aim is to entrench their dominance. Instead, they should adopt comprehensive strategies that aim at providing social conditions that enable individuals and collectives to thrive (Lees-Marshment et al., 2020), which include progressive taxation to redistribute AI-generated wealth, substantial investment in education and workforce reskilling to equip individuals for an AI-driven economy, stringent labor regulations to protect workers from exploitation in automated industries, and ensure that AI is a commons rather than adding to socio-economic inequalities, a growing computational injustice. Critically, there must be a concerted effort to challenge the disproportionate influence of tech elites on public policy (Ricaurte, 2022), ensuring that governance frameworks are designed to serve collective well-being rather than elite agendas. Superficial solutions like AI-funded UBI must not be heralded as quick fixes for systemic inequalities. Instead, efforts must focus on addressing the root causes of these disparities, building a society where technological innovation supports justice, inclusion, and equity rather than perpetuating existing power imbalances.},

  abstract     = {The convergence of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of music and entertainment. Robots are evolving from performing traditional service-oriented tasks to enabling advanced human-robot interaction (HRI) with potential emotional engagement. The pursuit of robotic expressiveness presents new challenges and opportunities in the modeling, design and control of musical and entertainment robots. Current studies mainly work on the design and physical implementation of robots capable of manipulating various musical instruments \cite{wang2022data,lim2012towards}, while the development of socially intelligent robots for real-time HRI remains underexplored. With advancements in AI, robots can now compose and improvise, as well as interpret and respond to human affective states during HRI \cite{mccoll2016survey, wang2024human}.This research topic was initiated to present the latest developments of AI-powered musical and entertainment robots. As a result of the call, six papers have been accepted and collected in this research topic. These articles provide a comprehensive exploration of diverse artistic forms including singing, dancing and musical performance on instruments such as the piano, violin, guitar, drum and marimba. Figure \ref{fig:overview} shows an overview of the musical robots investigated in these studies.Among the contributed works, two articles focused on dexterous manipulation and sensorimotor coordination. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1463744/full}{Gilday et al.} introduced a general-purpose system featuring a parametric hand capable of playing both the piano and performing guitar pick strumming. Unlike existing bespoke robotic musical systems, the proposed hand was designed as a single-piece 3D-printed structure, demonstrating potential for enhanced expressiveness in entertainment applications through the modulation of mechanical properties and actuation modes. The study highlighted that leveraging system-environment interactions enabled diverse, multi-instrument functionalities and variable playing styles with simplified control. Instead of musical instrument playing, \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1450177/full}{Twomey et al.} investigated dance performance using wearable soft sensors on the arm to explore whether such devices could enhance artistic expression. Dance movements were modeled as colliders within virtual mass-spring-damper systems, and limb segments were analyzed in local frames to avoid drift issues commonly associated with IMUs. The authors proposed a parallel algorithm to detect improvisational dance movements and control soft wearable actuators which can change size and lighting in response to detected motions. This work exemplified sensorimotor coordination and demonstrated how traditional dance and aesthetics could be enriched by spontaneous wearable-driven movements.Robot learning and control represent one of the biggest challenges in musical and entertainment robotics, particularly for acquiring manipulation skills and robotic expressiveness. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1439629/full}{Horigome and Shibuya} developed a RL-based controller for a violin-playing robot, a 7-DoF dual-arm system actuated by DC motors. The system mimics human performance with the left arm handling fingering and the right arm controlling bowing movements. The right arm regulates multiple parameters including bowing speed, pressure, sounding point and direction. Analysis of the target sound pressure demonstrated that the robot successfully learned violin-playing techniques and enables expressive performance variations. The robot was automated to play the violin based on musical scores, demonstrating its ability to interpret and execute complex musical tasks. Similarly, \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1450097/full}{Karbasi et al.} explored robotic drumming using a two-DoF robotic arm with flexible grippers, which is referred to as ZRob. They employed an RL-based algorithm with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) architecture, incorporating both extrinsic and intrinsic reward signals. The results showed that intrinsic rewards triggered the emergence of novel rhythmic patterns. Additionally, the robot&amp;#39;s physical dynamics—embodied intelligence—were found to influence the learning algorithm due to the physical constraints of the drumming setup. This study highlights the interplay between robotic hardware and learning algorithms in achieving expressive musical performance. It can be seen that reinforcement learning continues to be a powerful and widely utilized approach for enabling robots to acquire complex manipulation and expressive skills. The aforementioned studies have investigated both hardware and software advancements. However, the interaction between these robots and humans has not been explored. \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1461615/full}{Gao et al.} investigated synchronization between human musicians and Shimon, a robotic marimba player capable of head and arm movements. Their study revealed that ancillary and social gestures, particularly head movements, significantly enhance temporal synchronization between humans and robots. Through experiments with human participants, the results demonstrated positive social engagement when collaborating with robots in artistic performances. The study also found that social head gestures improved synchronicity slightly more than ancillary or instrumental gestures, providing quantitative insights into the role of non-verbal cues in HRI. Similarly, \href{https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1463477/full}{Nishiyama and Nonaka} investigated the concept of &amp;quot;togetherness&amp;quot; in a singing scenario, where human participants coordinated their voices with either another human or a machine (Vocaloid) under non-visual conditions. The study highlighted that human-to-human cooperation achieved higher similarity and anticipatory synchronization compared to human-machine interaction. These findings highlight the critical role of embodiment in enabling natural and effective collaboration, demonstrating how physical presence and human-like traits shape interaction dynamics.In conclusion, reinforcement learning holds strong potential in tackling the key challenges of equipping musical robots with advanced skills. Current AI-driven robotic systems have demonstrated the feasibility of achieving robotic expressiveness in various musical instruments. However, human-robot interaction presents a more complex research topic that requires interdisciplinary collaboration across fields such as robotics, materials science, computer science, psychology, musicology, sociology and ethics.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative robotics is a very promising technology for many industrial processes, including e.g., manufacturing, logistics, or construction. This new technology are also changing the environment for workers in industry. Research on human-robot interaction (HRI) will be crucial for enhancing the operator&amp;#39;s work conditions and well-being, as well as production performance. In that regard, human factors, with a special emphasis on cognitive ergonomics are fundamental to implementing safe, fluent, and efficient collaborative applications. This Research Topic gathers a range of contributions on the study of Human Factors and Cognitive ergonomics in user-centered and collaborative applications in industrial settings. Here, we summarize these studies from the perspective of three pivotal areas impacted by collaborative robotics: workers&amp;#39; safety, performance, and well-being. The Reseach Topic provides a timely analysis of the changing landscape of industrial HRI as we stand on the cusp of a new era in industrial automation, defined by the fusion of human ingenuity and robotic efficiency. The contributions within offer practical insights and forwardthinking perspectives on how collaborative robotics can transform industrial workspaces in the future, in addition to reflecting state-of-the-art research in the field. A different aspect of this intricate relationship is covered by each article in this issue, from the social and psychological effects of incorporating robots into human-centered work environments to the complexities of design and implementation. Developing solutions that are both technologically sophisticated and human-centered requires a holistic approach, which is crucial for comprehending the complex nature of HRI.Before delving into the particulars of each contribution, we invite the reader to this brief summary, briefly presenting each contribution to the research topic through the lenses of safety, performance, and well-being.We hope that this will support reflections on the wider societal implications of HRC development, in addition to their technical and ergonomic aspects. A harmonious balance between human needs and machine capabilities will be key to the future of industry.In the field of Human Factors and Cognitive Ergonomics, introducing advanced collaborative robotic systems in production environments necessitates reevaluating safety from different perspectives, namely safety perceptions of workers, safety behaviours and mechanical safety. Integrating this technology in various industrial environments, such as manufacturing and logistics, prompts a critical examination of the interplay of the different elements interacting in the socio-technical system. As with any human-system interaction in the work context, a more ergonomic and anthropocentric system (characteristics that can be measured through optimisation of associated cognitive factors) implies greater safety in terms of prevention and mitigation of potential mechanical risk (understood as collisions, crushing, entrapment, etc.) and psychosocial risk as defined by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) such as excessive workload, lack of control, job insecurity or insufficient communication .The present special issue includes diverse studies, each exploring different aspects of safety in human-robot collaboration.The contribution by Mirnig et al. (2023) constitutes an excellent opening to the special issue. While focusing on automated material handling vehicles, Mirnig et al. discuss many design aspects that are applicable also to HRI more broadly, including contextual factors such as purpose and context of use, and many aspects of the interaction itself. The study by Onnasch et al. (2023) investigates how directing a worker&amp;#39;s attention to specific targets with gaze communication can improve safety in humanrobot interaction by, first of all, suggesting how robotic eye design could affect operator attention and perceived cognitive workload. Furthermore, the paper indirectly suggests how robotic eyes could potentially prevent mechanical risks like collisions and entrapments. According to research, an operator&amp;#39;s situational awareness and capacity to anticipate and respond to possible hazards are enhanced when they focus on anthropomorphic robot eyes. This study highlights anthropomorphism&amp;#39;s contribution to improving operator safety and attention, leading to safer and more conscious HRIs in industrial settings. On the effect of anthropomorphic features in collaborative robots, the paper by Roesler (2023) examines the impact of anthropomorphic versus technical framing of robots on operators&amp;#39; trust, particularly in the context of robot failures. The study concludes that although the general levels of trust between technically framed and anthropomorphically framed robots did not significantly differ, people perceived the anthropomorphically framed robots as being more transparent, particularly after understandable failures. Because it improves operators&amp;#39; awareness and skill in anticipating and responding to potential mechanical risks like collisions or entrapments, this increased perceived transparency and positive perception in the event of understandable failures by potentially contributing to increased safety in HRIs. In a complementary way, Freire et al. (2024) also addresses the importance of safety in human-robot collaboration, but through a different mechanism.Their proposed cognitive architecture incorporates a &amp;quot;Socially Adaptive Safety Engine,&amp;quot; which dynamically adjusts safety parameters like distance and robot speed based on the worker&amp;#39;s trust level and preferences. While Roesler&amp;#39;s study emphasizes how transparency in robot behavior following failures can enhance safety, Freire et al. go further by actively modifying robot behavior in real-time to adapt to each worker&amp;#39;s trust and comfort, creating a more personalized and context-sensitive safety environment. Together, these articles suggest that fostering both transparency and adaptability in robots-through anthropomorphic design and context-aware systems-can significantly enhance operator safety and well-being in industrial environments.In a comprehensive perspective, Heinold et al. (2023) discusses various occupational safety and health (OSH) risks and benefits associated with the integration of robotic systems in industrial settings. These include both physical risks, such as collisions and mechanical failures, and psychosocial risks, including mental stress and job insecurity, which can arise from the use of advanced robotics in workplaces. The study also explores opportunities, such as the potential for reducing physical strain and improving longterm physical health by automating physically demanding tasks. The peculiarity of this manuscript lies in its comprehensive analysis of both physical and psychosocial OSH risks and opportunities, uniquely incorporating workers&amp;#39; expectations alongside evidence from the literature, offering a dual perspective on the safety implications of HRI. On a similar note, also addressing logistics and agricultural domains in addition to the manufacturing one, Pietrantoni et al. (2024) investigated experts&amp;#39; opinions regarding collaborative robotics safety considerations. Their study emphasized the critical role of tailored safety protocols, highlighting the need for advanced collision avoidance systems, failsafe mechanisms, and emergency stop protocols. Key aspects in agriculture include stability control and navigation on uneven ground for the safety and efficiency of workers. This sectoral approach completes the dual perspective taken by Heinold et al. in that it details how diverse industrial working contexts require tailor-made safety solutions to address both physical risks and ergonomic challenges and further promote the safe integration of robotics into complex work environments.The impact of human autonomy and robot work pace on job quality in collaborative settings is examined by Van Dijk et al. (2023). They find that higher human autonomy levels correlate with lower perceived workloads. The present article generally addresses some of the main working conditions leading to psychosocial risks according to OSHA, namely excessive workloads, lack of involvement in making decisions that affect the worker, and lack of influence over the way the job is done. This study shows that increasing human autonomy and modifying robot work pace can effectively reduce cognitive and temporal demands on workers. It compares scenarios of human-led work, fast-paced robot-led work, and slow-paced robot-led work. According to these results, reducing workload is linked to a lower mechanical risk because there is a lower probability of mistakes in HRI. This suggests that such measures optimise perceived workload and improve safety in collaborative scenarios.In the context of an industrial defect inspection task, the article of Cymek et al. (2023) examines the phenomenon of decreased individual effort and attention in human-robot collaborative tasks. The study finds that individuals searching for defects with a robot partner may have been less focused and exerted more mental energy than those searching alone, who on average, found more defects. Because less alert workers may be more likely to overlook safety hazards in their environment. This lower level of attentiveness and operational performance in human-robot teams affects productivity and may increase exposure to mechanical risks.workload. The article&amp;#39;s relevance is critical, considering that collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technology for retaining the ageing workforce and maintaining an appropriate quality of work. It finds that senior workers have a strong acceptance of technology and positive experiences during increased cognitive demand. As a result of increased mental demand during dual-task collaboration, the study found that task errors and duration increased despite these favourable perceptions. This might have detrimental effects on safety behaviours. While senior workers are generally open to working with robots, this increased cognitive workload-as indicated by eye tracking and cardiac activity-indicates that overburdening from collaboration may result in overwork and increase the mechanical risks in the workplace.For human-robot interaction to be considered successful, assessing and supporting the performance of the system as a whole is of utmost importance. In fact, one might even say that successful performance of the system is a necessary requisite when arguing for its existence. Successful performance can be defined in many different ways but in essence it is the combination of two things; doing things accurately (effective), and being efficient while doing it. In the context of collaborative human-robot settings, this research topic investigates relations between human-factors and performance in terms of temporal performance and cognitive load (Van Dijk et al., 2023;Pluchino et al., 2023), collaborative setting and error rate (Cymek et al., 2023), as well as collaborative setting and perceived workload (Van Dijk et al., 2023). While all these papers are mentioned above in relation to safety, they also bring relevant results in relation to performance. Van Dijk et al. (2023) show a positive correlation between temporal performance and cognitive load, comparing two conditions with a fast vs slow scheduling for the HRC setup. Pluchino et al. ( 2023) analyze the performance in terms of errors and time on task of senior workers engaged in a sequential collaborative manufacturing task together with a cobot. A dual task condition where the subjects were challenged with a secondary mathematical assignment is compared to a single task (control) condition. Results show that the dual task condition lead to increases in both errors and time spent on task, which corresponded with higher levels of perceived mental effort. However, no differences in perceived performance, as assessed by the NASA-TLX questionnaire, were found between the conditions. Cymek et al. (2023) compares two versions of an inspection task, one collaborative where a human operator is working together with a robot, and one individual where the operator is working alone. Results show lower performance for the collaborative setting in terms of fewer identified defects during inspection, indicating an reduction in cognitive load compared to the individual condition.As previously discussed, the effects on performance of different types of collaborative queues are investigated by Onnasch et al. (2023). An indirect argument is made for faster reallocation of attention as a result of naturalistic attentional queues leading to increased performance. This paper also provides a brief argumentation that some queues used to improve collaboration, e.g., legible motion, may directly impact performance in a negative way, while robot eyes does not.Finally, in their study of technical expert&amp;#39;s opinions of HRC also mentioned earlier, Pietrantoni et al. (2024) found that the introduction of collaborative robots is expected to bring improved efficiency and better worker conditions, e.g. as a result of automation of physically demanding operations. While the participants in the study generally held a positive attitude towards collaborative robots, the increased efficiency was also linked to concerns of job displacement and the need for reskilling.A key concern of cognitive ergonomics is to reduce negative effects of work. This also specifically refers to deployed technologies at the workplace, like advanced robotic systems. However, a truly humancentered approach to workplace and technology design aims at developing a person&amp;#39;s personality and fostering individual and organizational health in its broadest sense. A holistic understanding of health goes beyond the physical safety of humans, but includes mental and social well-being of humans. In the everevolving landscape of human-robot interaction, the integration of advanced robotics to different workplaces, raises critical questions about how the well-being of individuals might be affected. This research topic includes different publications, each shedding light on different facets of human-robot-interaction and its implications for the human experience thus potentially leading to well-being in the long-term.As mentioned earlier, Heinold et al. (2023) address the question which psycho-social consequences are associated with a close interaction between humans and robots. By combining scientific perspectives through a literature review and insights from workers&amp;#39; expectations, the study provides a holistic view of the implications of task automation via robotic systems. The findings highlight the psycho-social impacts advanced robotics may have on workers. It becomes clear, that the aspects of task design and function allocation as well as the specific interactions design of systems as well as operation and supervision design are relevant sources potentially affecting the specific user experience and the well-being of workers in the long run.When further considering potential psychological effects, assessing traditional workplace factors can be beneficial. From human factors research it is well understood, that the level of job control or autonomy within a given task is a strong determinant for job quality and well-being (Van Der Doef and Maes, 1999). This also applies to industrial tasks (Rosen and Wischniewski, 2019). As working tasks are newly allocated between humans and robots, human autonomy levels can change. The investigation of human autonomy and robotic work pace by Van Dijk et al. (2023) discussed earlier is also relevant from a well-being perspective.The research underscores the significance of autonomy and work pace in shaping job quality, emphasizing the importance of designing collaborative scenarios that prioritize human autonomy and adjustments to the robot&amp;#39;s work pace to optimize workload and enhance overall well-being.Exploring psycho-social effects more on a team level in this research topic is done by Cymek and colleagues. Their contribution focuses on the well-studied phenomenon of social loafing (Cymek et al., 2023). Using a visual-search task, the presented study investigates whether reduced individual effort, the phenomenon in question, which is commonly observed in human teams, also occurs in human-robot teams.The findings suggest that working with a robot team partner may lead to less attentive task execution, highlighting the need to address mental effort and attention allocation in human-robot collaboration to ensure optimal performance and, consequently, well-being.A human-centred technology design can contribute to a positive human-robot interaction and thus ensure a seamless workflow. One very relevant aspect of robot design which is touched upon in research is the application of anthropomorphic design features (Roesler et al., 2021). Two papers of this research topic explore the unique effects of anthropomorphic features in human-robot-interaction on different aspect of the distinct interaction quality and user experience. As mentioned earlier, Onnasch et al. (2023) examine how the design of predictive robot eyes influences human attention. The results indicate that anthropomorphic features contribute to a smooth interaction experience. Anthropomorphic robotic eyes trigger reflexive attention reallocation, hinting at a social and automatic processing of artificial stimuli, emphasizing the emotional and cognitive impact of such interactions on well-being. Through their analysis of anthropomorphic framing discussed earlier, Roesler (2023) show that an adequate level of trust within human-robot-interaction is also an important element contributing to a smooth interaction and a humancentered design. In this paper the perceived transparency of anthropomorphic robots emerges as a key factor, underscoring its role in shaping individuals&amp;#39; well-being.A novel design approach in order to facilitate socially adaptive robot behaviour in industrial settings is presented by Freire and colleaguesFreire et al. (2024). The authors present a theoretical cognitive architecture for robotic actions control, highlighting modules that among others take into account human preferences and situational awareness and by thus can adapt to human needs. The presented cognitive architecture is integrated into a recycling plant use case for disassembly tasks showcasing the basic functionalities of the systems. In the piloted use cases, the architecture demonstrated key Frontiers},
