  abstract     = {In the aftermath of a sudden catastrophe, first responders (FRs) strive to reach and rescue immobile victims. Simultaneously, civilians use the same roads to evacuate, access medical facilities and shelters, or reunite with their relatives via private vehicles. The escalated traffic congestion can significantly hinder critical FR operations. A proposal from the Türkiye Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is to allocate a lane on specific road segments exclusively for FR use, mark them clearly, and precommunicate them publicly. For a successful implementation of this proposal, an FR path should exist from designated entry points to each FR demand point in the network. The reserved FR lanes along these paths will be inaccessible to evacuees, potentially increasing evacuation times. Hence, in this study, we aim to determine a subset of links along which an FR lane should be reserved and analyze the resulting evacuation flow under evacuees’ selfish routing behavior. We introduce this problem as the first responder network design problem (FRNDP) and formulate it as a mixed-integer nonlinear program. To efficiently solve FRNDP, we introduce a novel bilevel nested heuristic, the Graver augmented multiseed algorithm (GAMA) within GAMA, called GAGA. We test GAGA on synthetic graph instances of various sizes as well as scenarios related to a potential Istanbul earthquake. Our comparisons with a state-of-the-art exact algorithm for network design problems demonstrate that GAGA offers a promising alternative approach and highlights the need for further exploration of quantum-inspired computing to tackle complex real-world problems.

  abstract     = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) tackles combinatorial optimization problems in a quantum computing context, where achieving globally optimal and exact solutions is not always feasible because of classical computational constraints or problem complexity. The performance of QAOA generally depends on finding sufficiently good parameters that facilitate competitive approximate solutions. However, this is fraught with challenges, such as “barren plateaus,” making the search for effective parameters a nontrivial endeavor. More recently, the question of whether such an optimal parameter search is even necessary has been posed, with some studies showing that optimal parameters tend to be concentrated on certain values for specific types of problem instances. However, these existing studies have only examined specific instance classes of Maximum Cut, so it is uncertain if the claims of instance independence apply to a diverse range of instances. In this paper, we use instance space analysis to study QAOA parameter initialization strategies for the first time, providing a comprehensive study of how instance characteristics affect the performance of initialization strategies across a diverse set of graph types and weight distributions. Unlike previous studies that focused on specific graph classes (e.g., d -regular or Erdős–Rényi), our work examines a much broader range of instance types, revealing insights about parameter transfer between different graph classes. We introduce and evaluate a new initialization strategy, quantum instance-based parameter initialization, that leverages instance-specific information, demonstrating its effectiveness across various instance types. Our analysis at higher QAOA depths ( p = 15) provides insights into the effectiveness of different initialization strategies beyond the low-depth circuits typically studied.

  abstract     = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has enjoyed increasing attention in noisy, intermediate-scale quantum computing with its application to combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA has the potential to demonstrate a quantum advantage for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. As a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, the classical component of QAOA resembles a simulation optimization problem in which the simulation outcomes are attainable only through a quantum computer. The simulation that derives from QAOA exhibits two unique features that can have a substantial impact on the optimization process: (i) the variance of the stochastic objective values typically decreases in proportion to the optimality gap, and (ii) querying samples from a quantum computer introduces an additional latency overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel stochastic trust-region method derived from a derivative-free, adaptive sampling trust-region optimization method intended to efficiently solve the classical optimization problem in QAOA by explicitly taking into account the two mentioned characteristics. The key idea behind the proposed algorithm involves constructing two separate local models in each iteration: a model of the objective function and a model of the variance of the objective function. Exploiting the variance model allows us to restrict the number of communications with the quantum computer and also helps navigate the nonconvex objective landscapes typical in QAOA optimization problems. We numerically demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm using the SimOpt library and Qiskit when we consider a metric of computational burden that explicitly accounts for communication costs.

  abstract     = {Optimizing the controls of quantum systems plays a crucial role in advancing quantum technologies. The time-varying noises in quantum systems and the widespread use of inhomogeneous quantum ensembles raise the need for high-quality quantum controls under uncertainties. In this paper, we consider a stochastic discrete optimization formulation of a discretized binary optimal quantum control problem involving Hamiltonians with predictable uncertainties. We propose a sample-based reformulation that optimizes both risk-neutral and risk-averse measurements of control policies, and solve these with two gradient-based algorithms using sum-up-rounding approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the differentiability of the objective function and prove upper bounds of the gaps between the optimal solutions to binary control problems and their continuous relaxations. We conduct numerical simulations on various sized problem instances based on two applications of quantum pulse optimization; we evaluate different strategies to mitigate the impact of uncertainties in quantum systems. We demonstrate that the controls of our stochastic optimization model achieve significantly higher quality and robustness compared with the controls of a deterministic model.

  abstract     = {A key component of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is the choice of classical optimizer employed to update the parameterization of an ansatz. It is well recognized that quantum algorithms will, for the foreseeable future, necessarily be run on noisy devices with limited fidelities. Thus, the evaluation of an objective function (e.g., the guiding function in the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) or the expectation of the electronic Hamiltonian in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)) required by a classical optimizer is subject not only to stochastic error from estimating an expected value but also to error resulting from intermittent hardware noise. Model-based derivative-free optimization methods have emerged as popular choices of a classical optimizer in the noisy VQA setting, based on empirical studies. However, these optimization methods were not explicitly designed with the consideration of noise. In this work we adapt recent developments from the “noise-aware numerical optimization” literature to these commonly used derivative-free model-based methods. We introduce the key defining characteristics of these novel noise-aware derivative-free model-based methods that separate them from standard model-based methods. We study an implementation of such noise-aware derivative-free model-based methods and compare its performance on demonstrative VQA simulations to classical solvers packaged in scikit-quant .

  abstract     = {This study introduces a new optimization model and a branch-and-cut approach for synthesizing optimal quantum circuits for reversible Boolean functions, which are pivotal components in quantum algorithms. Although heuristic algorithms have been extensively explored for quantum circuit synthesis, research on exact counterparts remains relatively limited. However, the need to design quantum circuits with guaranteed optimality is increasing, especially for improving computational fidelity on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. This study presents mathematical optimization as a viable option for optimal synthesis, with the potential to accommodate practical considerations arising in fast-evolving quantum technologies. We set a demonstrative problem to implement reversible Boolean functions using high-level gates known as multiple control Toffoli gates while minimizing a technology-based proxy called quantum cost—the number of low-level gates used to realize each high-level gate. To address this problem, we propose a discrete optimization model based on a multicommodity network and discuss potential future variations at an abstract level to incorporate technical considerations. A customized branch and cut is then developed upon different aspects of our model, including polyhedron integrality, surrogate constraints, and variable prioritization. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach in finding cost-optimal circuits for all benchmark instances within a two-hour time frame. Furthermore, we present interesting intuitions from these experiments and compare our computational results with relevant studies, highlighting newly discovered circuits with the lowest quantum costs reported in this paper.

  abstract     = {Quantum computation promises to advance a wide range of computational tasks. However, current quantum hardware suffers from noise and is too small for error correction. Thus, accurately utilizing noisy quantum computers strongly relies on noise characterization, mitigation, and suppression. Crucially, these methods must also be efficient in terms of their classical and quantum overhead. Here, we efficiently characterize and mitigate crosstalk noise, which is a severe error source in, for example, cross-resonance based superconducting quantum processors. For crosstalk characterization, we develop a simplified measurement experiment. Furthermore, we analyze the problem of optimal experiment scheduling and solve it for common hardware architectures. After characterization, we mitigate noise in quantum circuits by a noise-aware qubit routing algorithm. Our integer programming algorithm extends previous work on optimized qubit routing by swap insertion. We incorporate the measured crosstalk errors in addition to other, more easily accessible noise data in the objective function. Furthermore, we strengthen the underlying integer linear model by proving a convex hull result about an associated class of polytopes, which has applications beyond this work. We evaluate the proposed method by characterizing crosstalk noise for two chips with up to 127 qubits and leverage the resulting data to improve the approximation ratio of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm by up to 10% compared with other established noise-aware routing methods. Our work clearly demonstrates the gains of including noise data when mapping abstract quantum circuits to hardware native ones.

  abstract     = {Quantum relative entropy (QRE) programming is a recently popular and challenging class of convex optimization problems with significant applications in quantum computing and quantum information theory. We are interested in modern interior-point (IP) methods based on optimal self-concordant barriers for the QRE cone. A range of theoretical and numerical challenges associated with such barrier functions and the QRE cones have hindered the scalability of IP methods. To address these challenges, we propose a series of numerical and linear algebraic techniques and heuristics aimed at enhancing the efficiency of gradient and Hessian computations for the self-concordant barrier function, solving linear systems, and performing matrix-vector products. We also introduce and deliberate about some interesting concepts related to QRE such as symmetric quantum relative entropy. We design a two-phase method for performing facial reduction that can significantly improve the performance of QRE programming. Our new techniques have been implemented in the latest version (DDS 2.2) of the software package Domain-Driven Solver (DDS). In addition to handling QRE constraints, DDS accepts any combination of several other conic and nonconic convex constraints. Our comprehensive numerical experiments encompass several parts, including (1) a comparison of DDS 2.2 with Hypatia for the nearest correlation matrix problem, (2) using DDS 2.2 for combining QRE constraints with various other constraint types, and (3) calculating the key rate for quantum key distribution (QKD) channels and presenting results for several QKD protocols.
