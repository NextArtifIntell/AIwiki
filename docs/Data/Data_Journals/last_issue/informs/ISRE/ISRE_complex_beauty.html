  abstract     = {Fueled by social media, health misinformation is spreading rapidly across online platforms. Myths, rumors, and false information on vaccines are flourishing, and the aftermath can be disastrous. A more concerning trend is that people are increasingly relying on social media to obtain healthcare information and tending to believe what they read on social media. Given the serious consequences of misinformation, this study aims to explore the efficacy of a potential cure for the infodemic we face. Specifically, we focus on a countermeasure that Twitter used, which is to nudge users toward credible information when users search topics for which erroneous information is rampant. This Twitter’s policy is unique, in that the intervention is not about censorship but about redirecting users away from false information and toward facts. Our analysis uses 1,468 news articles that contain misinformation about health topics such as measles, vaccines, and cancer. Our analysis reveals that Twitter’s nudging policy reduces misinformation diffusion. After the policy introduction, a news article that contains misinformation is less likely to start a diffusion process on Twitter. In addition, tweets that contain a link to misinformation articles are less likely to be retweeted, quoted, or replied to, which leads to a significant reduction in the aggregated number of tweets each misinformation article attracts. We further uncover that the observed reduction is driven by the decrease both in original tweet posts—those that first introduce misinformation news articles to the Twitter platform—and in those resharing the misinformation, although the reduction is more significant in resharing posts. Last, we find that the effect is driven primarily by a decrease in human-like accounts that share links to unverified claims but not by a decrease in activities by bot-like accounts. Our findings suggest that a misinformation policy that relies on a nudge to a credible source rather than on censorship can suppress misinformation diffusion.

  abstract     = {Many online labor platforms employ reputation systems and monitoring systems to mitigate moral hazard. Whereas reputation systems have the potential to reduce moral hazard, they suffer from the cold-start problem, in which new entrants without an established reputation face a high entry barrier as employers predominantly select workers based on their existing reputation. Monitoring systems, providing employers with direct oversight of workers’ actions, offer a different approach. By tracking and reporting workers’ effort levels, monitoring systems reduce ex post information asymmetry and, thus, lower employers’ expected moral hazard risk from workers. However, unlike reputation systems, monitoring systems do not directly address ex ante information asymmetry, failing to assist employers in identifying the right workers. This inherent limitation raises questions about their effectiveness in resolving the cold-start problem. In this paper, we first propose a stylized theoretical model that characterizes worker entry in the presence of reputation and monitoring systems. Based on a unique data set from a leading online labor platform, we then empirically investigate the effect of monitoring systems on the entry barriers by examining the change in workers’ entry behaviors after the introduction of the monitoring system along with associated project outcomes, which include employers’ hiring preferences, hiring prices, and project performance. We exploit the differential availability of the monitoring system across two project types: time-based projects, for which the monitoring system is accessible, and fixed-price projects, for which it is not. Employing a difference-in-differences estimation with a sample including 9,344 fixed-price projects and 3,118 time-based projects, we report that the introduction of the monitoring system increases the number of bids on time-based projects by 27.8%, and the incremental bids predominantly originate from inexperienced workers who lack platform reputation. We further find that, following the introduction of the monitoring system, employers’ preference for experienced workers diminishes, accompanied by an average reduction of 19.5% in labor costs, whereas we observe no significant decrease in project completion and review rating. Our results collectively suggest that monitoring systems alleviate the cold-start problem in online platforms. History: Xiaoquan (Michael) Zhang, Senior Editor; Beibei Li Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Suicidal ideation (SI), as a psychiatric emergency, requires immediate assistance and intervention. Most people with SI do not actively seek help from mental health professionals, which may result in irreversible consequences. Research has shown that individuals experiencing SI increasingly express their thoughts and emotions on social media platforms, making the latter a viable venue for suicidal ideation detection (SID). This paper proposes, develops, and evaluates a knowledge-enhanced transformer-based approach (KETCH) to SID from social media content. KETCH comprises several key novel design artifacts, including a social media-oriented SI lexicon, a model-level method for integrating domain knowledge (i.e., lexicon) into a state-of-the-art transformer, and aligned dynamic embedding and lexicon-based enhancement that integrate domain relevance and contextual importance of terms to effective SID. We evaluate KETCH’s performance with social media data in two different languages collected from distinct platforms, and further examine its generalizability to user-level models for suicide risk prediction and depression detection. The results demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of KETCH via a series of empirical evaluation and a field study. Our research makes multifold research contributions and opens up practical opportunities for timely detection and proactive intervention of SI, which can have far-reaching impacts on public health, the economy, and society.

  abstract     = {Effective customer acquisition heavily hinges on sequential targeting to ensure that appropriate marketing messages reach customers. Sequential targeting could guide customers through the acquisition process and thus, optimize long-term revenue for the firm. Toward this goal, reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in facilitating sequential targeting during user acquisition. However, decisions made by RL during this process often lack explainability. We introduce the deep recurrent Q-network with attention model, which optimizes the long-term reward of sequential targeting while enhancing the explainability of the decisions. The key idea of the proposed model is to revise Q-learning by adding an attention mechanism to create a bottleneck, forcing the model to focus on features of the next ad exposure that will lead to optimal long-term rewards. We estimate our model using a comprehensive data set from a digital bank. The empirical results show that the proposed model is explainable and also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of long-term revenue optimization. Specifically, the attention mechanism within the model functions as forward planning. The forward planning can spot those features in the next ad exposure that are more likely to lead to the optimal outcome. We further demonstrate how the model makes targeting decisions of advertising channel choices by showing that the model can (1) learn optimal ad channels to target customers from different industries, (2) adjust advertising channels in response to dynamic customer behaviors, and (3) learn the seasonality of the customer’s industry and calibrate the ad channel correspondingly.

  abstract     = {Sponsored search results (SSRs) that deviate from users’ search queries often raise suspicion despite receiving positive evaluations from previous users. Such a suspicion typically prompts users to avoid SSRs. To address this issue, our study focuses on the role of online informational cues, such as product reviews and ratings from user-generated content, in reducing users’ suspicion when encountering these SSRs. Drawing on the theoretical perspective of state suspicion, we contextualize the dimensions of suspicion in the SSR context, including decision uncertainty , perceived malintent of the search platform , and processing of an SSR . We propose theory-based strategies for reducing the suspicion of users by incorporating informational cues about an SSR in the product search process in e-commerce contexts. Specifically, we theorize that the internalization of an informational cue can reduce users’ decision uncertainty and/or their perceived malintent of the platform, which will increase their processing of an SSR. Our approach also considers contingent factors that trigger users’ internalization. We conducted three laboratory experiments, and the results support our theorization. Our study uncovers the internalization mechanism of informational cues in addressing the suspicion of users in online information search contexts and offers practical implications to e-commerce platforms to facilitate users’ decision-making processes.

  abstract     = {Argumentation is an omnipresent rudiment of daily communication and thinking. The ability to form convincing arguments is not only fundamental to persuading an audience of novel ideas but also plays a major role in strategic decision making, negotiation, and constructive, civil discourse. However, humans often struggle to develop argumentation skills, owing to a lack of individual and instant feedback in their learning process, because providing feedback on the individual argumentation skills of learners is time-consuming and not scalable if conducted manually by educators. Grounding our research in social cognitive theory, we investigate whether dynamic technology-mediated argumentation modeling improves students’ argumentation skills in the short and long term. To do so, we built a dynamic machine-learning (ML)–based modeling system. The system provides learners with dynamic writing feedback opportunities based on logical argumentation errors irrespective of instructor, time, and location. We conducted three empirical studies to test whether dynamic modeling improves persuasive writing performance more so than the benchmarks of scripted argumentation modeling (H1) and adaptive support (H2). Moreover, we assess whether, compared with adaptive support, dynamic argumentation modeling leads to better persuasive writing performance on both complex and simple tasks (H3). Finally, we investigate whether dynamic modeling on repeated argumentation tasks (over three months) leads to better learning in comparison with static modeling and no modeling (H4). Our results show that dynamic behavioral modeling significantly improves learners’ objective argumentation skills across domains, outperforming established methods like scripted modeling, adaptive support, and static modeling. The results further indicate that, compared with adaptive support, the effect of the dynamic modeling approach holds across complex (large effect) and simple tasks (medium effect) and supports learners with lower and higher expertise alike. This work provides important empirical findings related to the effects of dynamic modeling and social cognitive theory that inform the design of writing and skill support systems for education. This paper demonstrates that social cognitive theory and dynamic modeling based on ML generalize outside of math and science domains to argumentative writing.

  abstract     = {Advertising on e-commerce marketplaces, wherein sponsored product listings are interleaved with organic product listings in the search results, is a large and growing phenomenon that falls under the umbrella of “retail media.” In this paper, taking the perspective of the marketplace, we obtain insights into the impact of sponsored listings being shown at the most salient positions in the list of results. To do so, we analyze data from a large-scale field experiment at Flipkart, a leading online marketplace in India. We find nuanced results that substantially vary across categories. In the electronics category, the sponsored listings perform worse (in terms of clicks and conversions) than the organic listings that they replace, whereas the organic listings in the neighborhood of the sponsored listings perform better than in the absence of the sponsored listings. Surprisingly, these effects are reversed in the clothing and footwear categories, in which the ads perform better than the displaced organic listings, suggesting that sponsored listings might help the platform identify new high-relevance products and improve search rankings for these categories. However, at the search level, because of the countervailing impacts on sponsored listings and neighboring organic listings (even though the directions of these effects are different for different categories), we find that increasing the fraction of sponsored listings (by about 10% points) does not affect clicks and conversions in any product category. This implies that ads bring in additional revenue for the marketplace yet do not hurt overall consumer response (in the short run). We theorize that the variation across categories occurs because of differing degrees of information asymmetry on product relevance to a query between the marketplace and the independent sellers of listed products and provide supporting evidence for this mechanism.

This paper proposes machine learning–based methods to quantify the evasiveness and incoherence of the more-informed party during real-time strategic conversations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in a real-world setting, we consider the question-and-answer sessions of earnings conference calls, during which managers face scrutinizing questions from analysts. Being reluctant to disclose adverse information, managers may resort to evasive answers and sometimes respond less coherently than they otherwise would. Using data from the earnings calls of S&amp;P 500 companies from 2006 to 2018, we show that the proposed measures predict worse next-quarter earnings. The stock market also perceives incoherence as a negative signal. This paper contributes methodologically to business analytics by developing machine learning methods to extract behavioral cues from real-time strategic conversations. We believe the wide adoption of these tools can increase the efficiency of various markets and institutions where real-time strategic conversations routinely occur, which ultimately benefits business and society.

Through a case study of Mayo Clinic Connect, an online patient community sponsored by Mayo Clinic, we uncover how firm and community stakeholders jointly align firm- and community-based governance. We introduce the concept of a governance alignment capability, which helps avoid and resolve governance tensions, contributing to the success of participatory governance. We specifically uncover two governance alignment mechanisms: informalizing the formal and formalizing the informal. These mechanisms adapt firm-based governance to align more closely with community norms and standardize community-based governance within the firm’s governance structure. The study contributes to both the nascent literature on firm-sponsored online communities and the broader literature on governance by highlighting the importance of participatory governance capabilities in balancing effectiveness and legitimacy in firm-sponsored online communities and emphasizing governance as a dynamic, rather than a static, system.

  abstract     = {With the explosive growth of data and the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and automated working processes, humans inevitably fall into increasingly close collaboration with machines as either employees or consumers. Problems in human–machine interaction arise as a consequence, not to mention the dilemmas posed by the need to manage information on ever-expanding scales. Considering the general superiority of machines in this latter respect, compared with human performance, it is essential to explore whether human–machine collaboration is valuable and, if so, why. Recent studies propose diverse explanation methods to uncover machine learning algorithms’ “black boxes,” aiming to reduce human resistance and enhance efficiency. However, the findings of this literature stream have been inconclusive. Little is known about the influential factors involved or the rationale behind their impacts on human decision processes. We aimed to tackle these issues in the present study by specifically examining the joint impact of information complexity and machine explanations. Specifically, we cooperated with a large Asian microloan company to conduct a two-stage field experiment. Drawing upon studies in dual-process theories of reasoning that propose different conditions necessary to arouse humans’ active information processing and systematic thinking, we tailored the treatments to vary the level of information complexity, the presence of collaboration, and the availability of machine explanations. We observed that, with large volumes of information and with machine explanations alone, human evaluators could not add extra value to the final collaborative outcomes. However, when extensive information was coupled with machine explanations, human involvement significantly reduced the default rate compared with machine-only decisions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms with three-step empirical analyses. We reveal that the coexistence of large-scale information and machine explanations can invoke humans’ active rethinking, which, in turn, shrinks gender gaps and increases prediction accuracy. In particular, we demonstrate that humans can spontaneously associate newly emerging features with others that had been overlooked but had the potential to correct the machine’s mistakes. This capacity not only underscores the necessity of human–machine collaboration, but also offers insights into system designs. Our experiments and empirical findings provide nontrivial implications that are both theoretical and practical. History: Param Vir Singh, Senior Editor; Tianshu Sun, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Guided Diverse Concept Miner (GDCM) is an interpretable deep learning algorithm to (1) automatically extract corpus-level concepts from text data, (2) focus the discovery of concepts to filter through only the concepts highly correlated to the user-specified managerial outcome, and (3) quantify the concept’s correlational importance to the outcome. GDCM is used to explore and potentially extract previously unknown concepts and insights from the text that may explain the managerial outcome, without the need to provide any human-predefined guidance or labeled data on concepts. GDCM embeds words, documents, and concepts all in the same vector space, enabling easy interpretation of discovered concepts by associating words local to the concept vector. GDCM is explicitly configured to increase recovered-concept diversity, coherence, and relevance to managerial outcomes. We demonstrate GDCM as a “guided exploratory” tool for a hypothetical managerial case involving online purchase journey data connected to consumed reviews. GDCM scalably extracts concepts hidden in customer reviews highly correlated to conversion and provides concept importance in comparison with product ratings. Concepts produced turn out to be product qualities previously theorized to impact conversion in the literature, and correlational importance gauged by GDCM closely matches estimates from a previous causal study run on a similar data set, serving as external validations of GDCM as a “guided exploratory” tool. Additional experiments with other data show that extracted insights are sensitive to guiding managerial variables and sensibly so, further demonstrating the flexibility of GDCM as a managerial tool.

In this network space, we find a significant increase over time in the proximity of non–information and communication technologies (ICT) industries to the ICT industry. Such “ICT-closeness” of an industry relates to a significant increase in the proportion of ICT technologies in the industry’s patent portfolio and complementarity between ICT and non-ICT patents in its portfolio. We hypothesize and find that ICT-Closeness has a significant positive impact on innovation outcomes of the citing industry, including innovative efficiency, recombinant capabilities, and creation of new products, services, and business methods. ICT-closeness also engenders hypercompetition in the citing industries, as reflected in greater winner-take-all dynamics and turbulence.

  abstract     = {Although online lending enjoyed explosive growth in the past decade, its market size remains small compared with other financial assets. The risk of losing money, stringent government regulations, and low awareness of the benefits have hampered the realization of the full potential of the online lending market. Because online loans are an emerging asset class, investors may not be aware of the investment performance of online loans compared with other assets, and it remains an open question whether online loans offer sufficiently attractive returns to warrant inclusion in an asset allocation decision. To attract lenders, platforms must provide an appealing investment opportunity which entails construction of portfolios of loans that investors find attractive. We propose general characteristics-based portfolio policy (GCPP), a novel framework to overcome the difficulties associated with portfolio construction of loans. GCPP directly models the portfolio weight of a loan as a flexible function of its characteristics and does not require direct estimation of the distributional properties of loans. Using an extensive data set spanning over one million loans from 2013 to 2020 from LendingClub, we show that GCPP portfolios can achieve an average annualized internal rate of return (IRR) of 8.86%–13.08%, significantly outperforming an equal-weight portfolio of loans. We then address the question of whether online loans can earn competitive rates of return compared with traditional investment vehicles through six market indices covering stocks, bonds, and real estate. The results demonstrate that a portfolio of online loans earns competitive or higher rates of return compared with traditional asset classes. Furthermore, the IRRs of the loan portfolios have small correlations with the benchmark index IRRs, pointing toward significant diversification benefits. Together, we demonstrate that GCPP is an approach that can help platforms better serve both borrowers and lenders en route to growing their business.

  abstract     = {The rapidly growing sharing economy is characterized by improved resource utilization through peer-to-peer transactions. Sharing platforms usually adopt one of three rental models, long-term, on-demand, and hybrid, where the long-term rental requires full dedication of resources to market over a predefined period, the on-demand rental allows resources to be exchanged for a fraction of the period, and the hybrid rental model provides both options. We develop an analytical model consisting of a monopolistic sharing platform that connects renters with owners who have heterogeneous asset utilization and incur different setup and transaction costs of participation under different rental models. We identify the conditions under which each of the three rental models can emerge as the platform’s optimal rental strategy and further examine their impacts on social welfare and consumer surplus. We find that the relative setup cost and the relative transaction cost between owners and renters play a crucial role in shaping the equilibrium market price and optimality of the three rental models, whereas the total costs determine the equilibrium transaction volume and sustainability of the three rental models. Only when the total cost is low can all three models be sustainable, and each model could emerge to be optimal in the presence of a moderately high relative transaction cost on the owners’ side. Specifically, when the owners’ setup cost is significantly higher than the renters’, the on-demand model is optimal. When the owners’ setup cost is significantly lower than the renters’ and the renter’s setup cost is low, the long-term model is optimal. Only when their setup costs are comparable or when the owners’ setup cost is significantly lower than the renters’ and the renter’s setup cost is high can the hybrid model be optimal. When the platform optimally chooses the long-term or hybrid model, it also generates the highest social welfare, and in a wide range of parameter regions, it also yields the highest consumer surplus, leading to a win–win outcome. Overall, our results offer important new insights into the platform’s optimal rental-model choice in the sharing economy and its implications for consumers and society.

  abstract     = {The healthcare market faces severe information asymmetry; patients struggle to evaluate the quality of hospitals and make informed decisions about their healthcare. Review platforms (e.g., Yelp) have begun to display the clinical quality of hospitals (alongside consumer reviews) to inform patients about hospital selection. In 2017 and 2019, Yelp introduced a feature with clinical measures of maternity care for hospitals that deliver babies in select markets. We study how clinical quality measures displayed on Yelp—especially for those (clinically) high-quality hospitals—influence subsequent patients’ ratings of hospitals. Our difference-in-differences estimation shows that when clinical quality measures are displayed, high-quality hospitals are surprisingly punished with lower subsequent ratings on Yelp, especially hospitals with low staffing capacity. This novel finding is consequential for hospitals as patient dissatisfaction can jeopardize the federal funding that hospitals receive ( CMS.gov ). To tease out the underlying mechanism, we queried SafeGraph’s precise foot traffic data, and we observed a significant patient surge for hospitals that have high maternity care clinical scores displayed on Yelp. We used transfer deep learning to show that because of the patient surge, (only) hospitals with high maternity scores that were short staffed received significantly more negative patient reviews and more complaints about key hospital service areas, thus driving patient dissatisfaction and lower ratings. We contribute to theory and practice by elucidating the role of publicly displaying clinical quality measures in patient (dis-)satisfaction with hospitals.

  abstract     = {The abundance of consumer data has given rise to a new data broker industry that plays a pivotal role in targeted advertising. Many publishers rely on data brokers to gain (i) individual insights drawn from their own data or (ii) collective insights drawn from both their data and those of their competitors, thus improving their targeting capabilities. As data brokers control large volumes of data, they can govern how data insights are sold to downstream publishers. Despite their importance, prior studies provide little insight into the strategic function of data brokers and their subsequent impact on downstream competition. To address this research gap, we build an analytical model to analyze the interactions among a data broker, two competing publishers, and advertisers. Our analysis yields several novel findings. First, we show that the data broker may strategically set prices in a manner that leads to the exclusive selling of collective insights to one publisher, as opposed to nonexclusive selling involving two publishers. This result implies that it may be advantageous for the data broker to pursue an exclusive strategy that makes data insights scarcer for some firms. Second, we illustrate that competition between publishers can be either facilitated or impeded by the data broker depending on the broker’s interests when selling the data insights. Finally, the data broker may induce both competition-mitigation and value-enhancing effects that affect aggregate welfare. Interestingly, although the data broker’s decision (i.e., exclusive selling) may reduce market competition, the aggregate welfare can still improve because collective insights allow publishers to increase their targeting value for advertisers more efficiently.

  abstract     = {Hospitals have implemented health information technology (HIT) for clinical care to address rising operating costs in recent years. We integrate behavioral and institutional perspectives to explain how hospitals differentiate technological search relative to industry peers (i.e., search differentiation) for HIT portfolios. In the context of the U.S. healthcare industry, we theorize that hospitals’ search differentiation for HIT results jointly from idiosyncratic learning in response to cost-based performance shortfalls and isomorphic pressures in relation to changing policy uncertainty as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act has unfolded. Based on a panel data set from 3,319 hospitals in 2007–2014, we demonstrate that when costs increase relative to aspiration level, a hospital differentiates its search for HIT by exploring more novel technologies for clinical care relative to peers. As policy uncertainty declines from the conceptualization phase to the enactment phase of the HITECH Act, a hospital’s search differentiation for HIT increases to a greater extent in response to cost-based performance shortfalls as lower uncertainty reduces the need to imitate peers’ search. As policy uncertainty further declines from the enactment phase to the enforcement phase of the HITECH Act and reaches its lowest level, however, the hospital’s search differentiation for HIT increases to a smaller extent in response to cost-based performance shortfalls because of policy incentives and professional norms to promote implementation of common technologies. Overall, we provide a more holistic picture of how uncertainty in a dynamic regulatory context intertwines with organizational learning from performance feedback in shaping search differentiation.

  abstract     = {Businesses have widely used email ads to directly send promotional information to consumers. Whereas email ads serve as a convenient tool to allow firms to target consumers online, there is little evidence of their multichannel impact on consumer spending in both online and brick-and-mortar stores. In this paper, we utilize a unique high-dimensional data set from one of the world’s largest office supplies retailers to link each consumer’s online behaviors to item-level purchase records in physical stores. We employ a doubly robust estimator that incorporates nonparametric machine learning methods for causal estimation on observational data. Our results show that email ads significantly increase the retailer’s sales across different channels. We also investigate the effects of email ads on diverse consumer behaviors along the purchase funnel and find that increased sales result from increased purchase probability and a wider variety of products purchased by consumers. Further, we examine several moderating factors, such as product types and consumer segments, that influence the multichannel effects of email advertising. Overall, our study provides empirical evidence for the economic impact of email ads on consumer behavior across different channels and the underlying mechanisms thereof.

  abstract     = {Match formation is challenging in online matching platforms where suppliers are subject to dynamic capacity constraints. We provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how online matching platforms support the transmission and triangulation of multisource information for consumers to infer provider service quality and dynamic capacity states, and achieve desirable matching outcomes. Situating this study in the context of an online health consultation community (OHCC) and drawing upon signaling theory, we theorize how physicians’ owned and earned signals influence physicians’ voluntary online consultations with new patients they have not consulted with previously. Importantly, we articulate how these signaling effects are contingent upon physicians’ dynamic capacity in OHCC. We collected longitudinal data from a large OHCC in China and used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to characterize the dynamic physician capacity in the OHCC and test the hypotheses. Our findings reveal that service professionals’ owned and earned signals interactively work together to balance supply and demand dynamically, and thereby facilitating matchmaking. In OHCCs, where physicians provide voluntary service beyond their primary jobs at hospitals, we find that owned and earned signals increase patient consultations in different patterns contingent upon physicians’ capacity states. In addition, we discover the complementary and substitute relationships between owned signals and earned signals change when physicians are in different capacity states. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of online match formation under dynamic capacity constraints and the design of OHCCs.

  abstract     = {This study examines the impact of different mobile content delivery mechanisms on consumers’ coupon redemption behavior. Firms have two distinct content delivery options when engaging with consumers’ mobile devices: mobile push and mobile pull . Mobile push delivers firm-initiated (ad) content directly to consumers, whereas mobile pull requires consumers to initiate requests for (ad) content. We hypothesize that mobile push delivery increases the likelihood of coupon redemption due to reduced app-specific search costs compared with mobile pull. We further examine how app-specific use experience and store density influence the heterogeneity of consumer responses. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment in a geo-conquesting setting, targeting customers located around competitor retail stores with mobile coupons to drive them to stores of the focal retailer. Our results reveal that mobile push increases coupon redemption rates by 6.0%, with substantial heterogeneity based on app-specific use experience and store density. Notably, app-specific usage experience negatively moderates the effect of mobile push delivery on redemptions, likely because both usage experience and push notifications reduce app-specific search costs, thereby acting as substitutes for one another. In areas with higher store density, the positive effect of mobile push delivery on the redemption likelihood is greater, suggesting that push notifications can highlight the focal coupon among alternative store choices, thereby lowering consumer switching costs. These findings have important implications for retailers and brands in creating competitive mobile targeting campaigns that effectively leverage both mobile push and pull delivery mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Users on online dating platforms tend to encounter a cold-start problem, with limited user engagement in the initial stages of the matching process; this is partially due to privacy concerns. In this study, we propose ephemeral sharing as a privacy-enhancing design to strike a balance between users’ privacy concerns and the need for voluntary information disclosure. Ephemeral sharing refers to a digital design in which the information shared (e.g., a personal photo) becomes invisible and irretraceable to the receiver shortly after the receipt of such information. In partnership with an online dating platform, we report a large-scale randomized field experiment with more than 70,000 users to understand how ephemeral sharing influences users’ disclosure of personal photos, match outcome, and receiver engagement. The experiment features a treatment group in which subjects can upload an ephemeral photo along with their matching request and a control group in which subjects can instead upload a persistent photo. We find that users in the treatment group send more personal photos (and ones with human faces) compared with users in the control group. Additionally, the ephemeral sharing treatment leads to a higher number of matches and a higher level of receiver engagement. Further analyses suggest that the treatment effects are more salient for privacy-sensitive senders. Moreover, we find that the treatment effects on match outcome and receiver engagement can be explained by increases in the disclosure of personal photos. Last, through an online experiment, we show that ephemeral sharing increases disclosure intention by reducing privacy concerns related to data collection, dissemination, and identity abuse. Our study contributes to the literature and practice on privacy-enhancing designs for online matching platforms. History: Alessandro Acquisti, Senior Editor; Beibei Li, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Online peer-to-peer lending (i.e., P2P lending) has grown rapidly in recent years and is a new source of fixed income for investors. However, there is limited understanding of factors affecting individual lenders’ decision making in this context, which is characterized as highly risky. Drawing on construal level theory, we theorize how bidding amounts lenders submit are affected by interest rates and psychological distance caused by the borrower’s demographic attributes (i.e., geographic location, age, educational degree, and marital status) relative to those of the lender. Specifically, we study how psychological distance directly influences and shapes the effects of the duality of interest rates (i.e., as rates of return and as signals of potential risk) on bidding amounts. Using a rich data set from a popular Chinese online P2P lending platform, we apply multiple identification strategies and estimation methods to conduct our analyses. We find that geographic distance decreases the lenders’ bidding amounts (i.e., home bias effect ), whereas social distance increases the bidding amounts (i.e., social distance effect ). In addition, the positive effects of interest rates on bidding amounts are strengthened by the geographic and social distance between the lender and the borrower. Furthermore, we conduct four controlled experiments to explore the causality and mechanisms behind these relationships. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed.

  abstract     = {Platform giants typically possess strong power over other participants on the platforms. Such power asymmetry gives platform owners the edge on setting platform fees to capture the surplus created on their platforms. Although there is a heated debate on regulating these powerful platforms, the lack of empirical studies hinders the progress toward evidence-based policymaking. This research empirically investigates this regulatory issue in the context of on-demand delivery. Delivery platforms (e.g., DoorDash) charge restaurants a commission fee, which can be as high as 30% per order. To support small businesses, recent regulatory scrutiny has started to cap the commission fees for independent restaurants. This research empirically evaluates the effectiveness of platform fee regulation, by investigating recent regulations across 14 cities and states in the United States. Our analyses show that independent restaurants in regulated cities (i.e., those paying reduced commission fees) experience a decline in orders and revenue, whereas chain restaurants (i.e., those paying the original fees) see an increase in orders and revenue. This intriguing finding suggests that chain restaurants, not independent restaurants, benefit from the regulations that were intended to support independent restaurants. We find that platforms’ discriminative responses to the regulation may explain the negative effects on independent restaurants. That is, after cities enact commission fee caps, delivery platforms become less likely to recommend independent restaurants to consumers, and instead turn to promoting chain restaurants. Moreover, delivery platforms increase their delivery fees for consumers in regulated cities, suggesting that these platforms attempt to cover the loss of commission revenue by charging customers more.

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing is about leveraging information technologies to outsource tasks to a large group of people, who can either be paid workers or nonpaid workers. Differing from monetarily incentivized workers, nonpaid workers are more likely to be affected by coworking relationships. To explore the link between the network and volunteering behavior, we construct dynamic collaboration networks from 827,260 unique volunteers’ participation in 183,445 projects initiated by 74,556 nonprofit organizations over nine years in the capital city of China. Following a multiplex perspective, we allow each type of organization (i.e., school-based, community-based, other-based) to represent a separate network layer. We construct the measures of multiplex ties (i.e., social connections that are linked through multiple layers) and relational pluralism (i.e., involvement diversity in different layers). We find that volunteers with more multiplex ties and a lower level of relational pluralism have higher volunteering continuity and intensity of engagement, guaranteeing the supply of the volunteer labor force. However, they are less likely to explore unfamiliar organizations through interorganization movements. At a macro level, we show how the reduced interorganization movements impeded the development of small and newly established organizations. In addition, we show that incorporating these multiplexity measures improves the prediction of volunteer behavior by 5.390%, 1.624%, and 8.792% for continuity, movement, and engagement, respectively.

  abstract     = {Product recommendation and search are two technology-mediated channels through which e-commerce platforms can help customers find products. However, the relationship between the two channels and the underlying mechanisms and implications for platform design are not well understood. We leverage a randomized field experiment with 555,800 customers on a large e-commerce platform to investigate how product recommendation affects customer search. We vary the relevance of the recommendation that users experience upon arriving at the home page of the platform and find that a decrease in recommendation relevance leads to a significant increase in consumers’ use of the search channel, indicating a (partial) substitution effect between the two at the aggregate level. We find substantial heterogeneity across product categories, propose a conceptual framework, and theorize how different states of customer demand—demand fulfillment and demand formation—may drive such heterogeneity. The results are aligned with our framework and provide evidence that both demand formation and fulfillment are at work in the channel interactions between recommendation and search. Specifically, when customers receive more product recommendations in a category, they search more in that category with generic query words, which indicates complementarity between recommendation and search. However, when customers receive fewer product recommendations in a category of interest, they compensate for this reduction by searching more in that category with long-tail query words, which indicates a substitution between recommendation and search. This experimental study is among the first to examine the causal relationship between the recommendation channel and search channel and offers implications for the design of e-commerce platforms.

  abstract     = {Financial social media platforms, which rely on social media analysts (SMAs) to contribute content to investors, have emerged as a crucial channel for investors to gain access to financial information and for SMAs to monetize their content. However, we still have a limited understanding of the factors that affect how content is generated and monetized in financial social media platforms. This study focuses on the novel role of investors’ preferences for free/paid content and its sentiment and investigates the extent to which SMAs exhibit strategic content generation and monetization behaviors by catering to and trading off the investors’ preferences. We also evaluate the underlying mechanisms and implications of such strategic behaviors. Utilizing a data set from a financial social media platform based in China, we propose a Bayesian empirical model to jointly analyze the investor’s demand and SMAs’ strategic supply of financial social media content. The model estimation results show that SMAs cater to investors’, especially paid subscribers’, preferences in their content generation such that their strategic behaviors account for 46.20% (24.50%) of the variation in SMAs’ generation decision for free (paid) content sentiment. In addition, an SMA is more likely to produce paid content when the expected free readership increases and is less likely to do so when the expected paid subscriptions increase, evidence that SMAs do balance the preferences of different investors when monetizing content. We find that SMAs are strategic in acquiring readers via their content monetization decisions and retaining subscribers via their content generation decisions. Importantly, we uncover that the orientation of an SMA’s strategic catering behavior is driven by the audience composition effect. Our study provides new empirical evidence, associated theoretical explanations for the results, and a practical illustration of an approach to reduce the potential confirmation bias of investors who may favor information from some SMAs that are prone to strategic catering behaviors.

  abstract     = {In modern enterprise computing environments, multiple information technology (IT) services from first and third parties are often integrated to form coherent solutions for business customers. Using transaction cost economics (TCE) as a theoretical foundation, we seek to understand how uncertainties introduced by third-party services shape enterprise customers’ use of various IT services in these multivendor service settings. Specifically, we analyze a case of service disruption caused by a third party that affects the multivendor service but does not directly affect the first-party services. In line with the tenets of TCE, we find a temporary increase in the use of first-party services that can serve as a similar-goal substitute to fulfill the organization’s needs during the disruption; however, on average, we observe a net decline in the total use of services in the long run. We empirically analyze the role of first-party technical support during the disruption. Based on textual data from the first party’s technical support log, we use deep learning to assess what actions the first party can take during such disruptions to turn the challenge into an opportunity. We find that if the first party offers high-quality technical support that specifically addresses issues related to its product, it may be able to make lemonade out of lemons. Such technical support effectively boosts customers’ use of first-party services in the long run. Curiously, however, similar efforts by the first party in the predisruption period are ineffective in achieving the same effect. History: Bin Gu, Senior Editor; Yili (Kevin) Hong, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of information technology has fundamentally transformed the way information is processed in the financial market. One such technological advancement is algorithm trading, which allows traders to develop sophisticated strategies based on historical price data. This raises important questions: Do these algorithm trading strategies contribute to market instability? When do they yield profits for different market participants? To address these questions, we must move beyond the efficient market hypothesis, as this theory would suggest that such strategies yield no profit due to market efficiency. Instead, we explicitly incorporate initial market mispricing into our analysis and develop a stylized continuous-time model of algorithm feedback trading to investigate market outcomes. Our model yields closed-form solutions, enabling us to assess the degree to which the price diverges from the efficient level. We discover that algorithmic trading, when combined with initial market mispricing, can lead to significant market volatility, resulting in financial bubbles and crashes. However, this scenario only occurs when there is overpricing and the algorithm traders collectively employ a strategy that enlarges the mispricing. Depending on the initial mispricing in the form of underpricing or overpricing, different algorithm trading strategies (positive or negative) have different market impact, profitability, and policy implications.
