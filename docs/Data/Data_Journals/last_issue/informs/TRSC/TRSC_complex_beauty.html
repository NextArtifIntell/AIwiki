  abstract     = {In railway systems, a deadlock occurs when trains accidentally occupy positions that prevent each other from moving forward. Although deadlocks are rare events, they do occur from time to time, requiring costly recourse actions and generating significant knock-on delays. In this paper, we present a noncompact 0,1 linear programming formulation and a methodology for discovering (possibly future) deadlocks and the subsequent implementation of optimal recovery measures. The approach is implemented in a tool to dispatch trains in real time developed in cooperation with Union Pacific (UP) and currently in operations on the entire UP network.

  abstract     = {Less-than-truckload (LTL) freight carriers operate consolidation networks that utilize cross-docking terminals to facilitate the transfer of freight between trailers and enhance trailer utilization. This research addresses the problem of determining an optimal schedule for unloading inbound trailers at specific unloading doors using teams of dock workers. The optimization objective is chosen to ensure that outbound trailers are loaded with minimal delay with respect to their target loading due dates. Formulating this problem, which is known to be NP-hard, using a typical time-expanded network often results in an excessively large mixed-integer programming (MIP) model. To overcome this challenge, we propose an exact dynamic discretization discovery (DDD) algorithm that iteratively solves MIPs formulated over partial networks. The algorithm employs a combination of a simple time discretization refinement strategy to progressively refine the partial network until a provably optimal solution is obtained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving problem instances representative of a large L-shaped cross-dock in Atlanta. The DDD algorithm outperforms solving the model formulated over a complete time-expanded network with a commercial solver in terms of both computational time and solution quality for practical instances with 180 trailers, 44 unloading doors, and 57 loading doors. Additionally, we compare the DDD algorithm with a state-of-the-art interval scheduling approach using instances from a previous study with a different objective function and additional constraints. The DDD algorithm is computationally faster for most of the small and medium instances and achieves competitive bounds for the larger instances.

In this paper, a multiperiod, multicommodity, international, agricultural trade network equilibrium model is constructed with capacity constraints on the production, transportation, and storage of agricultural commodities. The model allows for multiple routes between supply and demand country markets, different modes of transport, and storage in the producing and consuming countries as well as in the intermediate countries. The generality of the underlying functions, coupled with the capacity constraints, allow for the modeling of competition among agricultural commodities for production, transportation, and storage. The capacity constraints also enable the quantification of various disaster-related disruptions to production, transportation, and storage on the volumes of commodity flows as well as on the prices. A series of numerical examples inspired by the effects of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on agricultural trade is presented, and the results are analyzed to provide insights into food insecurity issues caused by the war.},

  abstract     = {Integrated demand management and vehicle routing problems are characterized by a stream of customers arriving dynamically over a booking horizon and requesting logistical services, fulfilled by a given fleet of vehicles during a service horizon. Prominent examples are attended home delivery and same-day delivery problems, where customers commonly have heterogeneous preferences regarding service fulfillment and requests differ in profitability. Thus, demand management methods are applied to steer the booking process to maximize total profit considering the cost of the routing decisions for the resulting orders. To measure the requests’ profitability for any demand management method, it is common to estimate their opportunity cost. In the context of integrated demand management and vehicle routing problems, this estimation differs substantially from the estimation in the well-examined demand management problems of traditional revenue management applications as, for example, found in the airline or car rental industry. This is because of the unique interrelation of demand control decisions and vehicle routing decisions as it inhibits a clear quantification and attribution of cost, and of displaced revenue, to certain customer requests. In this paper, we extend the theoretical foundation of opportunity cost in integrated demand management and vehicle routing problems. By defining and analyzing a generic Markov decision process model, we formally derive a definition of opportunity cost and prove opportunity cost properties on a general level. Hence, our findings are valid for a wide range of specific problems. Further, based on these theoretical findings, we propose approximation approaches that have not yet been applied in the existing literature, and evaluate their potential in a computational study. Thereby, we provide evidence that the theoretical results can be practically exploited in the development of solution algorithms.

  abstract     = {Given a set of agents and a set of pickup-delivery requests located on a two-dimensional grid map, the multi-agent pickup and delivery problem assigns the requests to the agents such that every agent moves from its start location to the locations of its assigned requests and finally, to its end location without colliding into other agents and that the sum of arrival times is minimized. This paper proposes two exact branch-and-cut-and-price algorithms for the problem. The first algorithm performs a three-level search. A high-level master problem selects an optimal sequence of requests and a path for every agent from a large collection. A mid-level sequencing problem and a low-level navigation problem are solved simultaneously to incrementally enlarge the collection of request sequences and paths. The second algorithm first solves the sequencing problem to find a set of request sequences and then solves the navigation problem to determine if paths compatible with the request sequences exist. Experimental results indicate that the integrated algorithm solves more instances with higher congestion, and the deferred algorithm solves more instances with lower congestion and could scale to 100 agents and 100 requests, significantly higher than a state-of-the-art suboptimal approach.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes the use of heatmaps as a control lever to manage the probabilistic repositioning of independent drivers in crowdsourced delivery platforms. The platform aims to maximize order fulfillment by dynamically matching drivers and orders and selecting heatmaps that trigger the probabilistic flow of unmatched drivers to balance driver supply and delivery requests across the service region. We develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model to sequentially select matching and heatmap decisions in which the repositioning behavior of drivers is captured by a multinomial logit discrete choice model. Because of the curse of dimensionality and the endogenous uncertainty of driver repositioning, the MDP model is solved using a rolling-horizon stochastic lookahead policy. This policy decomposes matching and heatmap decisions into two optimization problems: a two-stage stochastic programming upper bounding problem for matching decisions and a mixed-integer programming problem for heatmap decisions. We also propose a simple policy for efficiently solving large-scale problems. An extensive computational study on instances derived from the Chicago ride-hailing data set is conducted. Computational experiments demonstrate the value of heatmaps in improving order fulfillment beyond the level achieved by matching alone (up to 25%) and identify conditions that affect the benefit of using heatmaps to guide driver repositioning.

  abstract     = {The vehicle routing problem with drones (VRP-D) that we consider is an extension of the capacitated vehicle routing problem in which the fleet consists of trucks equipped with one drone each. A truck and its drone can either move together or separately. A truck can release its drone at the depot or at a customer location and must pick it up later at another customer or the depot location. In this way, both trucks and drones deliver goods to customers working together as synchronized working units. A feasible route has to satisfy the capacity constraints of both the truck and the drone. A feasible solution to the VRP-D is a set of feasible routes such that each customer is served exactly once by either a truck or a drone. We investigate two standard objectives considered in the literature, that is, the minimization of the total routing cost and the sum of the routes’ durations. To solve the VRP-D exactly, we develop a branch-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm. In particular, we present a new forward and implicit bidirectional labeling algorithm defined over an artificial network to solve the column-generation subproblems. The new bidirectional labeling algorithm substantially accelerates the solution process compared with its monodirectional counterpart. The time needed to solve the pricing problems is reduced by 55% on average when minimizing routing costs and by 30% when minimizing the sum of the routes’ durations. In further computational experiments, we analyze algorithmic components of the BPC algorithm, compare the cost and duration objectives, and highlight the impact of the drones’ speed on the structure of VRP-D solutions. For the routing-cost minimization objective, our BPC algorithm is able to solve several VRP-D instances with 50 vertices to proven optimality within one hour of computation time. The same instances with duration minimization are more difficult, and the BPC algorithm provides only heuristic solutions with an average gap not exceeding 3%.

  abstract     = {In the age of e-commerce, logistics companies often operate within extensive road networks without accurate knowledge of travel times for their specific fleet of vehicles. Moreover, millions of dollars are spent on routing services that fail to accurately capture the unique characteristics of the drivers and vehicles of the companies. In this work, we address the challenge faced by a logistic operator with limited travel time information, aiming to find the optimal expected shortest path between origin-destination pairs. We model this problem as an online shortest path problem, common to many last-mile routing settings; given a graph whose arcs’ travel times are stochastic and follow an unknown distribution, the objective is to find a vehicle route of minimum travel time from an origin to a destination. The planner progressively collects travel condition data as drivers complete their routes. Inspired by the combinatorial multiarmed bandit and kriging literature, we propose three methods with distinct features to effectively learn the optimal shortest path, highlighting the practical advantages of incorporating spatial correlation in the learning process. Our approach balances exploration (improving estimates for unexplored arcs) and exploitation (executing the minimum expected time path) using the Thompson sampling algorithm. In each iteration, our algorithm executes the path that minimizes the expected travel time based on data from a posterior distribution of the speeds of the arcs. We conduct a computational study comprising two settings: a set of four artificial instances and a real-life case study. The case study uses empirical data of taxis in the 17-km-radius area of the center of Beijing, encompassing Beijing’s “5th Ring Road.” In both settings, our algorithms demonstrate efficient and effective balancing of the exploration-exploitation trade-off.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of jointly pricing and designing a smart transit system, where a transit agency (the platform ) controls a fleet of demand-responsive vehicles (cars) and a fixed line service (buses). The platform offers commuters a menu of options ( modes ) to travel between origin and destination (e.g., direct car trip, a bus ride, or a combination of the two), and commuters make a utility-maximizing choice within this menu, given the price of each mode. The goal of the platform is to determine an optimal set of modes to display to commuters, prices for these modes, and the design of the transit network in order to maximize the social welfare of the system. In this work, we tackle the commuter choice aspect of this problem, traditionally approached via computationally intensive bilevel programming techniques. In particular, we develop a framework that efficiently decouples the pricing and network design problem: Given an efficient (approximation) algorithm for centralized network design without prices , there exists an efficient (approximation) algorithm for decentralized network design with prices and commuter choice . We demonstrate the practicality of our framework via extensive numerical experiments on a real-world data set. We moreover explore the dependence of metrics such as welfare, revenue, and mode usage on (i) transfer costs and (ii) cost of contracting with on-demand service providers and exhibit the welfare gains of a fully integrated mobility system.
