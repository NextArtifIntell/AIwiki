  abstract     = {The consumption of digital content products (e.g., video games and live streaming) is often associated with multifaceted, dynamically interacting consumer behavior that is subject to influence from pertinent external events. Inspired by these characteristics, we develop a novel attention-based neural point process approach to holistically capture the richness and complexity of consumer behavioral dynamics in modern digital content consumption. Our model features a new multirepresentational, continuous-time attention mechanism that can flexibly model dynamic interactions between different types of behavior under external influence. Using learned representations as sufficient statistics of past events, we build a marked point process to efficiently characterize the occurrence time, behavior combination, and consumption quantity of consumers’ future activities. We illustrate our model development and applications in the empirical context of a sports video game, showing its superior predictive performance over a wide range of baseline methods. Leveraging individual-level parameter estimates, we further demonstrate our model’s utility for conducting segmentation analysis and evaluating the effects of past events on consumers’ future engagement. Our model provides managers and practitioners with a powerful tool for developing more effective and targeted marketing strategies and gaining insights into consumer behavioral dynamics in digital content consumption.

  abstract     = {This paper develops a theory-based, explainable deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to predict the time-varying emotional response to music. We design novel CNN filters that leverage the frequency harmonics structure from acoustic physics known to impact the perception of musical features. Our theory-based model is more parsimonious, but it provides comparable predictive performance with atheoretical deep learning models while performing better than models using handcrafted features. Our model can be complemented with handcrafted features, but the performance improvement is marginal. Importantly, the harmonics-based structure placed on the CNN filters provides better explainability for how the model predicts emotional response (valence and arousal) because emotion is closely related to consonance—a perceptual feature defined by the alignment of harmonics. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our model with an application involving digital advertising. Motivated by YouTube’s midroll ads, we conduct a laboratory experiment in which we exogenously insert ads at different times within videos. We find that ads placed in emotionally similar contexts increase ad engagement (lower skip rates and higher brand recall rates). Ad insertion based on emotional similarity metrics predicted by our theory-based, explainable model produces comparable or better engagement relative to atheoretical models.

Assessing the effectiveness of such advertising remains a challenge in research and practice. This paper proposes a new approach to perform causal inference on advertising bought through such mechanisms. Leveraging the economic structure of first- and second-price auctions, we establish novel results that show how the effects of advertising are connected to and, hence, identified from optimal bids. Importantly, we also outline the precise conditions under which these relationships hold. Because these optimal bids are required to estimate the effects of advertising, we present an adapted Thompson Sampling algorithm to solve a multiarmed bandit problem that succeeds in recovering such bids and, consequently, the effects of advertising, while minimizing the costs of experimentation. We also show that a greedy variant of this algorithm can perform just as well, if not better, when exploiting the structure of the model we consider. We use data from real-time bidding auctions to show that it outperforms commonly used methods to estimate the effects of advertising.

  abstract     = {Customer reviews help communicate product information, but their effectiveness may suffer from selection bias (i.e., depending on factors, such as the individual experience and price, not all consumers may voluntarily write reviews). Consequently, a seller may have to resort to additional means (e.g., signaling through price in the context of an experience good) to convey its quality. This paper develops an analytical model to investigate the interaction of customer reviews and price with the presence of selection bias in marketing an experience good with uncertain quality to consumers. Our analysis reveals the dual roles played by both customer reviews and price in communicating quality information. On one hand, customer reviews may either directly convey product information with unbiased distribution of reviews or facilitate price signaling when reviews are biased because of selection. On the other hand, price may be adjusted to mitigate the selection bias of reviews to make them more informative, and it may also signal quality directly in the presence of review bias. As a result, we show that bias in reviews may actually benefit consumers without compromising information communication as the incentive to reduce review selection bias makes it credible and profitable for the high-quality seller to signal its type by undercutting the price that would be set if it is of low quality. We then extend our analysis to examine the information, profits, and welfare impacts of several important design elements of a review system as well as the impact of consumers’ aversion to risk. Finally, the implications of our findings on the management of user-generated content and pricing are discussed. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor. Funding: J.

  abstract     = {Academics and practitioners acknowledge the value of customer feedback in improving firm performance. Companies routinely solicit feedback from different customer subsets. However, the extent to which this feedback impacts nonsolicited customers depends on whether firms implement meaningful business-level changes that resonate with customers. This paper assesses customer feedback’s impact on firm learning and business improvements as well as its spillover effects on nonsolicited customers using a randomized, controlled field experiment conducted in Rwanda over two years. We hypothesize that private feedback seeking could operate through two broad mechanisms: (a) directly influencing solicited customers and/or (b) prompting firms to improve their offerings, leading to spillover effects on other customers. Our results demonstrate a 38.2% increase in recall and a 77.4% increase in purchases for customers not engaged in the feedback process. The analysis further suggests that business-level changes driven by customer feedback fuel these spillovers. Additionally, customer feedback seeking significantly improves treatment firm performance, resulting in a 62.0% revenue increase and 54.5% profit increase compared with control firms. Our study also introduces a basic customer feedback-seeking technology for small businesses to improve performance. These findings can guide firms in leveraging customer feedback to undertake business changes and generate greater revenues/profits.

We train neural nets to provide the parameter estimate of a given (structural) econometric model, for example, discrete choice or consumer search. Training examples consist of datasets generated by the econometric model under a range of parameter values. The neural net takes the moments of a dataset as input and tries to recognize the parameter value underlying that dataset. Besides the point estimate, the neural net can also output statistical accuracy. This neural net estimator (NNE) tends to limited-information Bayesian posterior as the number of training datasets increases. We apply NNE to a consumer search model. It gives more accurate estimates at lighter computational costs than the prevailing approach. NNE is also robust to redundant moment inputs. In general, NNE offers the most benefits in applications where other estimation approaches require very heavy simulation costs. We provide code at: https://nnehome.github.io .

Using data from a field experiment conducted by an online freelance platform, we examine the effect of exposure to platform endorsement on user search and purchase behavior. We find that exposure to platform endorsement increases user search and purchases not only for endorsed services but also, for unendorsed services. We link the increase in search and purchases to an increase in the perception of the quality of services offered on the platform. We further explore heterogeneity in the effect of platform endorsement and find that the effect of exposure to platform endorsement on purchase is more pronounced for users with a higher propensity to purchase.

  abstract     = {This paper explores the impact of using advanced technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) to match marketers with social media influencers. We develop a theoretical model to examine how matching accuracy affects the competition between influencers and the profitability of a social media platform. Our findings show that improving matching accuracy may not always benefit the platform, especially for platforms with intermediate follower density. Two opposing effects of technology improvement affect the prices of influencer marketing campaigns: advanced technology, such as AI, enhances the matching between influencers and marketers and also intensifies competition between different types of influencers. The overall effect on prices can be negative for some influencers because of the asymmetric nature of such matching technology: the matching outcome for influencers with a narrower audience (niche influencers) is more sensitive to matching accuracy than that for those with a broader audience (general influencers). As a result, more niche influencers begin to participate in marketing campaigns when matching accuracy improves, which reduces the prices offered by sufficiently general influencers and may lead to a decline in platform revenue. Additionally, we find that adjusting commission rates in response to technology improvements could help mitigate the negative impact although it may not eliminate it entirely. Our findings offer valuable insights for social media platforms seeking to remain competitive in the influencer marketing landscape. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

We find that users prefer to follow playlists featured in the app. According to our estimates, being featured on the Search Page raises daily playlist followers by 0.95%—which is about two times larger than the effect on followers of including a song by an exceptionally popular major label artist (0.45%). Our examination of playlist demand has two important implications. First, Spotify can effectively guide user attention to certain playlists, supporting industry executives’ and artists’ concerns that the platform has the potential to favor some producers by selectively promoting their content. Second, popular artists signed with major labels play an important role in attracting followers to playlists on Spotify. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor for this article.

  abstract     = {We develop an AI and AI-human-based model for salesforce hiring using recordings of conversational video interviews that involve two-sided, back-and-forth interactions with messages conveyed through multiple modalities (text, voice, and body language). We derive objective, theory-backed measures of sales performance from these modalities, leveraging recent advances in body language analysis, conversational analysis, and large language models (LLMs). These measures serve as explanatory variables in our AI model. Our key contribution to the broader research on persuasion and influence is that we show how to use conversational videos to capture features related to (i) two-way conversational interactivity; (ii) real-time adaptation; and (iii) human body language, with minimal measurement error relative to extant survey-based approaches that suffer from recall biases. We use rubric-based scores by panels of sales professionals (correlated with hiring decisions) to isolate a candidate’s “latent sales ability” and use these as outcome variables to be predicted by the AI model. The AI model achieves reasonable predictive accuracy, yet incorporating human judgments into an AI-human hybrid model enhances its effectiveness—improving workforce quality by 67% over random selection. Although the content of what is spoken is most important in prediction, conversational interactivity, sellers’ real-time adaptation to the buyer, and body language also have good explanatory power. Finally, in terms of performance-cost trade-offs, the addition of just one human professional evaluation in the hiring loop in combination with AI is optimal. Further, using human input based on only the two early stages of the interview in a task-based hybrid model is the most cost-effective in improving performance.

  abstract     = {Recommender systems play a vital role in driving the long-term values for online platforms. However, developing recommender systems for multi-sided platforms faces two prominent challenges. First, recommending for multi-sided platforms typically involves a joint optimization of multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. Second, many platforms adopt hierarchical homepages, where items can either be individual products or groups of products. Off-the-shelf recommendation algorithms are not applicable in these settings. To address these challenges, we propose MOHR, a novel multi-objective hierarchical recommender. By combining machine learning, probabilistic hierarchical aggregation, and multi-objective optimization, MOHR efficiently solves the multi-objective ranking problem in a hierarchical setting through an innovative formulation of probabilistic consumer behavior modeling and constrained optimization. We implemented MOHR at Uber Eats, one of the world’s largest food delivery platforms. Online experiments showed significant improvements in consumer conversion, retention, and gross bookings, resulting in a $1.5 million weekly increase in revenue. Moreover, MOHR offers managers a mathematically principled tool to make quantifiable and interpretable trade-offs across multiple objectives. As a result, it has been deployed globally as the recommender system for Uber Eats’ app homepage. History: Puneet Manchanda served as the senior editor for this article.
