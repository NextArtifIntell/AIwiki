  abstract     = {Problem definition : Prototyping and testing are an integral part of almost any new product development process, helping firms navigate the inherent uncertainties of creating new products. Recent developments in rapid prototyping, including technologies that enable cheaper low-fidelity tests, have opened up the possibilities for firms in reconfiguring their product development processes. Firms can, by choosing the level of evaluation fidelity, alter the traditional cost-quality trade-offs inherent in sequential prototyping. Methodology/results : The current article formulates a general model of sequential search where firms can proceed by obtaining noisy low-fidelity evaluations of their prototypes. Our results demonstrate that the imperfect fidelity of evaluations alters the firm’s optimal experimentation, with the starkest difference being that it may make it optimal for the firm to select and launch a prototype that did not yield the best evaluation. In addition, our analysis of optimal measurement technology reveals that the focal firm should demand the most precise measurements when their ex-ante uncertainty is moderate (not too high or low). We also consider extensions analyzing how the optimal choice of evaluation fidelity is affected by the number of available prototypes, by operational flexibility (to dynamically change measurement technology), and by the ability to outsource evaluations to an experimentation platform. Managerial implications : We develop managerial insights for how the optimal choice of fidelity and the optimal length of the evaluation cycle should be planned depending on the evaluation costs and the firm’s ex-ante uncertainty. The resulting framework offers guidance to product and software development firms to successfully leverage imperfect fidelity experiments.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Limited resources in the judicial system can lead to costly delays, stunted economic development, and even failure to deliver justice. Using the Supreme Court of India as an exemplar for such resource-constrained settings, we apply ideas from service operations to study delay. Specifically, court dynamics constitute a case-management queue , whereby each case may experience multiple service encounters spread across time, but all are necessarily with the same server. Our goal is to elucidate the drivers of congestion, focusing on metrics such as the expected case-disposition time (delay) and expected number of cases awaiting adjudication (pendency), and leverage this understanding to recommend operational interventions. Methodology/results : We employ data-driven calibrated simulations to model the analytically intractable case-management queue. The life cycle of a case comprises two stages: preadmission (before determining its merit for detailed hearings) and postadmission. Our methodology allows us to capture the queueing dynamics in which the judges are shared resources across the two stages. It also permits modeling of holiday capacity, which is flexibly tailored to address any surplus work that spills over from the regular year. We find that the second stage of this judicial queue is overloaded, but holiday capacity creates a perception of stability by steadying performance metrics. Managerial implications : The sources of inefficiency that drive congestion include a misalignment between scheduling guidelines and judicial capacity, coupled with the requirement to schedule hearings in advance. Together, these factors inhibit utilization of shared capacity across the two-stage judicial queue. We demonstrate how interventions that account for these inefficiencies can successfully tackle judicial delay. In particular, scheduling to improve the allocation of time across preadmission and postadmission cases can cut down the expected delay by as much as 65%.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we investigate how line-sitting and express lines affect customers’ satisfaction and fairness perception about queues. In line-sitting, customers skip the wait by hiring others to stand in line on their behalf. In express lines, customers skip the wait by purchasing priority. Because both schemes disrupt the first-in-first-out (FIFO) rule, they may be perceived to be unfair and lead to customer dissatisfaction. Methodology/results : In three experiments, we find that customers are more satisfied with the overall queueing experience when they encounter a line-sitter than when they encounter an express-line customer, even when the wait time is held constant. We also find that customers perceive express lines as less fair than line-sitting, which has a significant influence on their satisfaction. A key operational difference between line-sitting and express lines is that line-sitting involves a one-to-one swap between a line-sitter doing a fair share of waiting and their client, whereas express lines insert a new priority customer into the queue without an existing surrogate in the queue. We show that if line-sitting includes an insertion by letting a line-sitter hold a spot for more than one customer, then line-sitting is perceived to be just as unfair and unsatisfying as express lines. Managerial implications : Our results imply that express lines can engender a lower fairness perception, thus harming future business through both more negative word of mouth and a higher customer churn. Therefore, service providers should beware of customer backlash against express lines and yet be more open-minded about line-sitting, provided that one-to-one swaps can be enforced.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : With the rapid growth of e-commerce, platforms are able to gather large quantities of data, which can result in high-precision predictions regarding consumer purchasing patterns and future demand. A fundamental question is whether a platform has the incentives and ability to share such nonverifiable information with its sellers. Methodology/results : We show that when information is nonverifiable, sharing the precise value of the platform’s private information by means of cheap-talk cannot result in an equilibrium. This outcome is due to the incentive of the platform to portray a more favorable market condition than that predicted, in order to encourage the sellers to raise their prices and improve market efficiency. In spite of this negative result, we demonstrate that the level of incentives misalignment between the platform and its sellers is bounded; consequently, a region-forecast information-sharing equilibrium can emerge. In this equilibrium, the support of the platform’s private information is divided into several intervals, and the platform strategically chooses to report truthfully the interval containing its private information. The structure of the partition is influenced by two main factors: the incentive of the platform to reduce market uncertainty for the sellers, and the motivation of the platform to soften competition among the sellers. Although both the sellers and the platform benefit from the ability to share some level of information, such an outcome hurts the consumers. Managerial implications : This work explains the observed practice of a platform providing nonverifiable information to its sellers via cheap-talk. The main advantage of this equilibrium is the ability to share information in a costless manner; however, the amount of information that can be shared is limited and is influenced by the level of market competition between the sellers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Online retailing platforms are increasingly relying on personalized recommender systems to help guide consumer choice. An important but understudied question in such settings is how many products to include in a recommendation set. In this work, we study how the number of recommended products influences consumers’ search and purchase behavior in an online personalized recommender system within a retargeting setting. Methodology/results : Via a field experiment involving 1.6 million consumers on an online retailing platform, we causally demonstrate that consumers’ likelihood of purchasing any product from the recommendation set first increases then decreases as the number of recommended products increases. Importantly, as much as 64% of the decrease in purchase probability (i.e., the choice overload effect) can be attributed to a decrease in consumers’ likelihood of starting a search (i.e., clicking on any recommended product). We discuss the possible behavioral mechanisms driving these results and analyze how these effects could be heterogeneous across different product categories, price ranges, and timing. Managerial implications : This work presents real-world experimental evidence for the choice overload effect in online retailing platforms, highlights the important role of consumer search behavior in driving this effect, and sheds light on when and how limiting the number of options in a recommender system may be beneficial to online retailers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the problem of forecasting an entire demand distribution for a new product before and after its launch. Firms need accurate distributional forecasts of demand to make operational decisions about capacity, inventory, and marketing expenditures. We introduce a unified, robust, and interpretable approach to producing these pre- and postlaunch distributional forecasts. Methodology/results : Our approach is inspired by Bayesian model averaging. Each candidate model in our ensemble is a life-cycle model fitted to the completed life cycle of a comparable product. A prelaunch forecast is an ensemble with equal weights on the candidate models’ forecasts, whereas a postlaunch forecast is an ensemble with weights that evolve according to Bayesian updating. Our approach is part frequentist and part Bayesian, resulting in a novel approach tailored to the demand forecasting challenge. We also introduce a new type of life-cycle or product diffusion model with states that can be updated using exponential smoothing. The trend in this model follows the density of an exponentially tilted Gompertz random variable. For postlaunch forecasting, this model is attractive because it can adapt itself to the most recent changes in a product’s life cycle. We provide closed-form distributional forecasts from our model. In two empirical studies, we show that when the ensemble’s candidate models are all in our new type of exponential smoothing model, this version of the ensemble outperforms several leading approaches in both point and quantile forecasting. Managerial implications : In a data-driven operations environment, our model can produce accurate forecasts frequently and at scale. When quantile forecasts are needed, our model has the potential to provide meaningful economic benefits. In addition, our model’s interpretability should be attractive to managers who already use exponential smoothing and ensemble methods for other forecasting purposes.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by carbon emissions trading schemes (ETSs), Treasury auctions, procurement auctions, and wholesale electricity markets, which all involve the auctioning of homogeneous multiple units, we consider the problem of learning how to bid in repeated multiunit pay-as-bid (PAB) auctions. In each of these auctions, a large number of (identical) items are to be allocated to the largest submitted bids, where the price of each of the winning bids is equal to the bid itself. In this work, we study the problem of optimizing bidding strategies from the perspective of a single bidder. Methodology/results : Effective bidding in PAB auctions is complex due to the combinatorial nature of the action space. We show that a utility decoupling trick enables a polynomial time algorithm to solve the offline problem where competing bids are known in advance. Leveraging this structure, we design efficient algorithms for the online problem under both full information and bandit feedback settings that achieve an upper bound on regret of O ( M T log T ) and O ( M T 2 3 log T ) , respectively, where M is the number of units demanded by the bidder, and T is the total number of auctions. We accompany these results with a regret lower bound of Ω ( M T ) for the full information setting and Ω ( M 2 / 3 T 2 / 3 ) for the bandit setting. We also present additional findings on the characterization of PAB equilibria. Managerial implications : Although the Nash equilibria of PAB auctions possess nice properties such as winning bid uniformity and high welfare and revenue, they are not guaranteed under no-regret learning dynamics. Nevertheless, our simulations suggest that these properties hold anyways, regardless of Nash equilibrium existence. Compared with its uniform price counterpart, the PAB dynamics converge faster and achieve higher revenue, making PAB appealing whenever revenue holds significant social value—for example, ETSs and Treasury auctions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The paucity of data on governmental regulatory agencies’ product safety defect investigations has restricted our knowledge about (1) the determinants of a regulator’s decisions to open or close an investigation, (2) the process it follows between opening and closing of an investigation, and (3) the outcomes of the investigation when it is closed. Methodology/results : The authors view a safety regulator’s opening and closing of a product defect investigation as a decision of interest to the operations management discipline. This data paper describes a rich, novel, and hand-collected data set of all investigations that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration—the U.S. regulator for automobile safety—opened and closed against 187 manufacturers between 2009 and 2021. The authors provide two Microsoft Excel data files, one capturing data for the investigations opened and the other for the investigations closed. The data files enable researchers to address three sets of research questions. First, researchers can use the “Data on Investigations Opened” file to model the determinants of a regulator’s opening of a product defect investigation. Second, researchers can mine the textual variables from both files to identify the steps involved in the investigation process. They can also use the process variables included in the data to investigate the regulator’s efficiency in opening and closing investigations. Third, researchers can use the “Data on Investigations Closed” file to better understand when and why a regulator closes an investigation and the outcomes of the closed investigations. Managerial implications : The data files can also be valuable to nonacademic stakeholders (e.g., governmental organizations and regulators, journalists, liability lawyers, politicians, and safety advocates).

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies the joint estimation of the consumer arrival rate and choice model parameters when “no-purchasers” (customers who considered the product but did not purchase) are not observable. Estimating this unconstrained demand even with the simplest discrete-choice model such as the multinomial logit (MNL) becomes challenging as we do not know the fraction that have chosen the outside option (i.e., not purchased). Methods have been proposed to use market share to pin down the parameter associated with the outside option. However, market share data are difficult to obtain in many situations, and in some industries, such as fashion retail, have little meaning as the items are difficult to compare. In this paper, we point out an additional difficulty that can arise in practice: Many firms monitor sales and optimize their prices and assortments within the sale period as part of their revenue management (RM) process, based on partially observed demand. This can potentially cause a revenue management induced endogeneity as the data used for estimation is the result of optimization (in turn based on prior data) to set controls. As we demonstrate, methods that work well on randomly generated assortments may do badly on optimized assortment data. Methodology/results : In this paper, we propose a robust method when the firm cannot observe no-purchases and has no market share information, and the data have been revenue-managed. We develop a two-step generalized method-of-moments (GMM) procedure that is based on a modified moment condition, and importantly, does not require instrumental variables (IVs), a significant advantage in practice. Managerial implications : In Monte Carlo simulations, the performance of our method matches existing methods when the controls are generated randomly, and is robust under all conditions, whether RM-induced endogeneity is present or not. On a large real-world data set from the fashion industry, subject to stock-outs and markdown pricing along with unknown management controls, our method provides robust estimates compared with existing methods without requiring any input on market shares, which is especially difficult to pin down at a category and season/collection level.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper examines the impact of retail store closures on omnichannel sales and consumer shopping behavior in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To explain the likelihood of store closure, we develop a novel instrumental variable motivated by varying geopolitical responses across the United States to the pandemic. Methodology/results : Using data from a luxury fashion retailer, we find that when a store is closed, the volume of online orders originating from its location increases by 24%. Furthermore, when the retailer closes 10% of its stores, the omnichannel total sales (offline + online) decrease by 5.5%. Notably, our findings indicate that the online channel enables the retailer to recover 11% of offline sales that would have otherwise been lost because of store closures. We also show that compared with existing e-shoppers, new e-shoppers are more likely to order popular product models in an effort to mitigate the heightened mismatch risk associated with online transactions. For new e-shoppers, the likelihood of ordering a popular model stands at 70%, whereas it is 45% for existing online consumers. Additionally, the conservative behavior of favoring popular models reduces the likelihood of returns by new e-shoppers. Managerial implications : Even for luxury apparel, which is often associated with in-store purchases requiring “touch and feel” and customer tryout, the option to purchase online proves immensely valuable. The tendency of new e-shoppers to limit product mismatch risk by choosing popular products may create an opportunity for retailers to strategically target these inexperienced online customers with advertisements, product promotions, or virtual fitting rooms, all geared toward reducing online shopping risk of product mismatch.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The improper disposal of electronic and electrical goods at the end of their useful lives (i.e., e-waste) can have adverse effects on the environment and human health. The increased awareness of the negative consequences of e-waste has prompted many regulators to enact recycling standards that promote the proper disposal and recycling of e-waste. A large body of research has used analytical models to explore how recycling standards affect firms that make electronic and electrical goods. A key insight from this research is that e-waste recycling standards would induce firms to design products that have reduced environmental impact and are easier to recycle. In other words, e-waste recycling standards would enhance inventive activity at firms to better comply with regulatory requirements. But hardly any empirical work has validated the insights developed with analytical models. Methodology/results : We empirically examine whether California’s Electronic Waste Recycling Act (EWRA) affects the inventive output (i.e., measured as patents) of firms that manufacture electronic and electrical goods. We leverage a quasi-experimental setup that arises when California enacted the EWRA and use multiple identification strategies to isolate the law’s effect on the inventive output of firms. We disentangle two causal pathways, industry and headquarter location , by which EWRA affects manufacturers. We find that EWRA increased the environmentally focused inventive output (i.e., “green” patents) of affected firms in California by nearly 14% and by nearly 8% for firms in other states. Interestingly, we also observe spillover effects—EWRA increased other inventive output (i.e., patents other than green patents) of affected firms in California by nearly 41% and by nearly 24% for firms in other states. Managerial implications : Our study provides important insights for managers and policy makers by empirically quantifying the impact of recycling standards on environmentally focused inventions and by identifying spillover effects for other inventions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : To investigate the interplay between servicizing and remanufacturing, two widely used strategies in the circular economy, and its impact on firms’ economic and environmental performance, we consider a profit-maximizing manufacturer who explores the possibility of jointly adopting the two strategies. Methodology and results : We develop optimization models that capture the main attributes for servicizing (pay-per-use, demand pooling) and remanufacturing (lower production costs, higher operating costs). We show that the presence of remanufacturing always makes servicizing less attractive to adopt, and having servicizing may discourage the adoption of remanufacturing if the remanufacturing cost reduction effect is not sufficiently large. The joint adoption of servicizing and remanufacturing is preferred when the remanufacturing cost is neither too high nor too low and the range of the remanufacturing cost that favors the joint adoption is further moderated by the firm’s pooling level and the operating cost of remanufactured products. Lastly, we find that when the firm adopts servicizing in the presence of remanufacturing with relatively high remanufacturing costs, it can reduce the number of remanufactured products with low environmental impact in the market and, thus, harm the environment, resulting in a misalignment between economic and environmental goals. Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that managers considering jointly adopting servicizing and remanufacturing must balance their competition on the low-usage end of the market with the potential complementarity due to remanufacturing cost reduction. Further, by showing the win-win conditions under which the joint adoption of servicizing and remanufacturing improves firms’ economic and environmental performance, we demonstrate that there are no one-size-fits-all circular economy strategies and call for caution when promoting these strategies across industries.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A growing number of firms are encouraging consumers to participate in “bring-your-own-container” (BYOC) behavior in which consumers bring their own reusable packaging to purchase and consume products, thus reducing single-use packaging waste. In this paper, we study the environmental implications of a firm’s BYOC implementation when considering its disposable packaging choice and communication strategy. Methodology/results : We build a stylized model to study a firm’s joint decisions on BYOC, disposable packaging choice, and communication and their implications on the environment. Our main results follow. First, allowing BYOC reduces the firm’s incentive to make fraudulent green claims about its disposable product packaging; however, BYOC implementation may harm the overall environment while improving the firm’s profit, thereby creating a new form of greenwashing. Second, the adoption of third-party certification for green disposable packaging is an effective remedy to mitigate the negative environmental impact of BYOC. In addition, the environmental implications of adopting third-party certification (either voluntarily or because of government mandates) depend on the relationship between the environmental qualities of green disposable packaging and reusable packaging. Whereas it always benefits the environment when the firm’s green disposable packaging has better environmental performance, adopting certification may negatively impact the environment if consumers’ reusable packaging is greener. Furthermore, we find numerically that offering a price discount for BYOC may encourage the firm to adopt certification because of increased profitability, thereby leading to the aforementioned environmental implications. Managerial implications : We offer operational insights on how firms should make joint decisions on BYOC, disposable packaging choice, and communication. We also generate insights on how governments should regulate firms’ green claims when firms start to allow BYOC.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This work aims to examine the role of emergency department (ED) operational status related to congestion in fast-track (FT) routing decisions and the subsequent effects on patient outcomes. Methodology/results : In this paper, we utilize a two-year data set from two hospital EDs in Alberta, Canada, and adopt an instrumental variable approach to examine the effects of FT routing decisions on patient outcomes. Based on the empirical findings, we utilize a data-calibrated simulation to compare the performance of different routing policies. First, our study reveals that FT routing decisions are not purely clinically driven, and ED operational status is also associated with FT routing decisions. Second, being routed to FT can improve ED efficiency by reducing the average length of stay and left without being seen rates. However, this efficiency improvement comes at the cost of potential quality decline. In particular, being routed to the FT leads to an 8.2% increase in the 48-hour revisit rate for the high-complexity group and a 2.3% increase for the medium-complexity group. Third, we delve into the mechanisms behind observed patient outcomes and find that physicians in the FT area may prioritize expediting patient flow by simplifying patient diagnosis and treatment procedures. Consequently, the quality of care may be compromised for high- and medium-complexity patients. Finally, our simulation findings highlight the importance of selecting the “right” patients to be routed to the FT unit. To this end, the complexity-based classification method and dynamic routing policies emerge as promising avenues. Managerial implications : Our findings call for immediate attention from healthcare practitioners to carefully balance the trade-off between emergency care efficiency and quality, emphasizing the necessity of selecting the right patients for routing.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies a multichannel healthcare system where physicians diagnose patients and prescribe treatment in-person or through asynchronous telemedicine (AT), a widely adopted yet relatively under-explored form of telemedicine. In collaboration with physicians at the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA), we examine the impact of introducing an AT channel on the existing in-person channel and on overall system performance. Methodology/results : VHA implemented AT at select clinics in the state of Georgia in 2012. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the introduction of the AT channel led to a sorting process whereby more complex patients were seen in the in-person channel. AT implementation led to a 20% increase in recommended visit time and an 8.5% increase in required clinical resources for in-person consultations. In addition, the adoption of AT resulted in higher throughput—more patients seen by the specialists per month across both channels. Using a fixed-effects model we find a reduction in average wait time for in-person referrals (37.5%), and for the most common medically necessary procedure (43%) despite an increase in the total number of consultations at the specialist clinic. We attribute the improved efficiency to early patient triage, better match between patient needs and treatment modality, and reduction of setup and switching costs in physicians’ workflow. Managerial implications : This paper contributes to our understanding of a rapidly expanding form of healthcare delivery: multichannel healthcare with in-person and AT channels. Our results suggest that healthcare managers and physicians can adopt AT to improve overall system efficiency. At the same time, they should take into account the additional impact of AT on the in-person channel when making capacity decisions and developing guidance on patient referrals.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In response to the increased use of telehealth to replace traditional office visits with a physician, several U.S. states have recently adopted telehealth pay-parity policies. Such policies state that payers must reimburse healthcare providers for telehealth services at the same rate that would apply if those services had been provided in a traditional office setting. But health policy researchers have pointed out that telehealth may not be as effective as a traditional office visit for acute care. Specifically, telehealth is associated with increased probability of a subsequent office visit (a “duplicate visit”). We examine whether telehealth pay-parity policies are effective at improving access to acute care, and under what conditions. Methodology/results : We use a three-stage game-theoretic model to study the impact of telehealth pay parity. In the first stage, the payer sets a reimbursement policy for telehealth visits. In the second stage, a healthcare provider commits a portion of its capacity to telehealth, and in the third stage, patients arrive and choose between telehealth and office visits according to an equilibrium queueing network. We find structural results for the equilibria and characterize the equilibria in closed-form. When the chance of a duplicate visit is moderate (neither too high nor too low), pay parity leads providers to allocate too much capacity to telehealth, resulting in lower overall patient access than could be otherwise achieved. We characterize a reimbursement level that avoids this misalignment and maximizes patient access, which we show is less than parity. Managerial implications : The literature shows that patients receiving acute care via telehealth may be more likely to require a duplicate, in-person visit to resolve their health concern. In the fee-for-service environment that is common in the United States for acute care, duplicate visits resulting from telehealth lead to an incentive alignment problem because they generate extra work and provider revenue, without any corresponding increase in patient access. Legislating pay parity for telehealth can lead to providers committing more capacity to telehealth, which may not always be good. However, there is good news in that all parties (payers, providers, and patients) would be better off if duplicate visits could be decreased. Policy makers should understand these implications before enacting policies that affect reimbursements for telehealth.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Coordinated care network (CCN) is a burgeoning paradigm where patients’ diagnosis and treatment plans are developed based on collaboration between multiple, colocated medical specialties to holistically address patients’ health needs. A primary performance metric for CCNs is how quickly patients can complete their itinerary of appointments at multiple medical services in the network. Rapid completion is critical to care delivery but also presents a major operational challenge. Because information about a patient’s condition and treatment options evolves over the course of the itinerary, care paths are not known a priori. Thus, appointments (except for the first one) cannot be reserved in advance, which may result in significant delays if capacity is not allocated properly. Methodology/results : We study capacity allocation for the patient’s first (root) appointment as the primary operational lever to achieve rapid itinerary completion in CCNs. We develop a novel queueing-based analytical framework to optimize this root appointment allocation, maximizing the proportion of patients completing care by prespecified deadlines. Our framework accounts for the complex interactions among all patients in the network through the blocking process, which contrasts with conventional siloed planning. We provide an exact characterization of the itinerary time and develop a mean-field approximation with convergence guarantees that permits tractable solutions for large-scale network problems. In a simulation case study of Mayo Clinic, our solution improves on-time completion from 60% under the current plan to more than 93%. Managerial implications : We demonstrate that root appointment allocation is a multifaceted problem and that ignoring any of those facets can lead to poor performance. Simultaneously accounting for all of these complexities makes manual template design or traditional optimization methods inadequate, highlighting the significance of our integrated approach.
