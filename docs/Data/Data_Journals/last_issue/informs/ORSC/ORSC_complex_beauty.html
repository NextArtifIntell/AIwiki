  abstract     = {Leader emotional expressions have profound implications for team members. Research has established that how frequently leaders express positive and negative emotional expressions shapes team member performance through conveying critical social-functional information about team member social worth. Yet, this social-functional approach to emotions has not fully considered how the timing of leader emotional expressions during a team’s lifecycle can also shape the information conveyed to individual team members about their social worth. In this paper, we integrate the social-functional approach to emotions with imprinting theory to propose that the temporal context of leader emotional expressions has performance implications for individual team members through two distinct facets of social worth: respect and status. Specifically, our imprinting framework explains how positive leader emotional expressions during the early team phase have the most beneficial performance implications through imprinting respect in individual team members. We then propose that these positive implications are amplified by more-frequent-than-average negative leader emotional expressions during the midpoint phase. When filtered through earlier positive expressions, negative emotional expressions during the midpoint phase may signal opportunities for respect and status gains rather than respect and status losses. We find general support for our model in a preregistered four-wave longitudinal archival study of 9,968 team members on 234 consulting teams at a leading professional services company and a four-wave longitudinal field study at a NCAA Division 1 sports program including 245 student-athletes and 86 coaches on 20 varsity teams. Our work highlights that the temporal context of leader emotional expressions is an important performance predictor through social worth.

  abstract     = {Employees from marginalized groups frequently face low performance expectations based on group membership. Although past research shows several different reactions to these types of expectations, such as stereotype threat and stereotype reactance, scholars still know little about when and why low expectations spur individuals to not only try to prove themselves, but to seek to change expectations and opportunities for others like them. Addressing this discrepancy, I introduce trailblazing motivation, which captures the desire to set new precedents that open doors for others. I integrate self-determination theory and regulatory focus theory to identify group-based low expectations, moderated by a sense of belonging with one’s broad marginalized group, and core self-evaluations as key antecedents of trailblazing motivation. I hypothesize that trailblazing motivation will lead to not only greater persistence in one’s work—as with stereotype reactance—but also potentially riskier behaviors aimed at changing expectations for one’s broad group on a larger scale, including advocacy for other marginalized group members and diversity, equity, and inclusion–related issue selling. I test and find support for these hypotheses across a time-lagged survey study and a preregistered experiment. I also establish discriminant validity for trailblazing motivation from other responses to group-based low performance expectations. This research advances our understanding of the behavior of marginalized individuals at work by helping to explain (1) when and why people facing group-based low expectations go beyond seeking to prove their own abilities and also strive to effect change for their marginalized group as a whole and (2) how a closer connection to one’s marginalized group can drive people to increase opportunities for that broad group.

  abstract     = {Past research has examined the link between initiatives promoting entrepreneurship and compensation, but scholars have predominantly focused on earnings of individuals directly engaged in the founding process, such as founders, cofounders, and start-up employees. Shifting our focus to incumbent workers, we instead propose that a decline in the cost of entrepreneurship increases the variance in pay among incumbent workers who are not involved in entrepreneurial activities. We posit that, as entrepreneurship becomes a more attractive career option, due to institutional changes, the outside option value of entrepreneurship increases. The resulting increase in mobility threat will disproportionately benefit high earners or those employees who are more difficult to replace: As their bargaining power increases, incumbents will disproportionately reward these workers, especially when they are systematically more inclined to leave for entrepreneurship. We explore these arguments using a difference-in-differences methodology, based on the enactment of an entry reform that reduced the cost of entry in Portugal between 1995 and 2009. We find that an exogenous decrease in the administrative costs of establishing a new venture led to high earners capturing disproportionate rewards relative to low earners. We further show that this relationship was especially pronounced among high earners who (a) exhibited a higher ex ante propensity to transition into entrepreneurship; (b) had fewer credible outside options in paid employment; and (c) operated in industries with decentralized wage bargaining arrangements. By documenting the impact of institutional changes that promote entrepreneurship on incumbent workers’ pay, our study contributes to recent debates about the impact of entrepreneurship on individual earnings.

  abstract     = {Virtual teams are ubiquitous in the workplace, yet they experience frequent collaboration challenges. Successfully managing the team collaboration paradox, in terms of maintaining a unified team perspective and diverse individual perspectives, presents a potentially important lever to improve virtual team performance. However, scholars have conflicting opinions regarding whether such improvement is possible. We argue that team collaboration paradox management will positively relate to team performance over time and can be improved via a theory-based intervention. This intervention draws from theory on paradoxes for its content (paradoxical thinking) and team development interventions for its structure (general content knowledge, team-specific feedback, action-focused planning). Given the complexity of paradoxes, it is unclear whether a single training session could substantively improve their management; therefore, one intervention condition was comprised of a single training session and the other condition included a follow-up session. Analyzing two waves of multisource quantitative data from a sample of 76 virtual teams from 37 organizations, we find a positive relationship between team collaboration paradox management and team performance at both time periods. We also find that only the intervention condition with the follow-up session, as compared with untreated control teams, significantly improved how well teams managed the collaboration paradox and thereby facilitated subsequent changes in team performance. Supplementary qualitative insights from the intervention sessions illuminate the actions virtual teams took to improve their collaboration paradox management. These results have important implications for the paradox and teams literatures, as well as the managers and members of virtual teams.

  abstract     = {In searching for the sources of heterogeneity in organizational cultures, one possibility is that new ventures show a cultural spawning of incorporating elements from the culture of the organization that the founder left (the parent) when starting the new venture. Such a genealogical effect would explain why some organizational cultures remain different, despite the opportunities to learn cultural elements from other organizations. This study investigates whether and under what circumstances such cultural spawning occurs. We argue that cultural spawning occurs, but with varying strength, depending on the founder and the culture of the parent organization. Applying the cultural toolkit perspective, we predict that it is stronger when founders have a longer tenure in the parent organization, the parent culture is more internally coherent, and the parent culture is more atypical, compared with other organizations. These ideas were tested with a sample of U.S. technology startups in Crunchbase. Natural language processing of Glassdoor employee reviews was used to identify the cultural elements of the technology companies. The analysis demonstrates that cultural spawning occurs and reveals previously unexplored contingencies of cultural transmission through congruency and atypicality. It contributes to research on new venture formation and organizational culture. Funding: Financial support from the Rudolf and Valeria Maag Endowment is gratefully acknowledged.

  abstract     = {Budgetary constraints force organizations to pursue only a subset of possible innovation projects. Identifying which subset is most promising is an error-prone exercise, and involving multiple decision makers may be prudent. This raises the question of how to most effectively aggregate their collective nous. Our model of organizational portfolio selection provides some first answers. We show that portfolio performance can vary widely. Delegating evaluation makes sense when organizations employ the relevant experts and can assign projects to them. In most other settings, aggregating the impressions of multiple agents leads to better performance than delegation. In particular, letting agents rank projects often outperforms alternative aggregation rules—including averaging agents’ project scores and counting their approval votes—especially when organizations have tight budgets and can select only a few project alternatives out of many.

  abstract     = {This study explores how Buddhist mindfulness as a self-reflective practice helps individuals respond to a paradox and ultimately dismantle it. To deeply immerse myself into this context, I conducted a nine-month ethnographic fieldwork in three Korean Buddhist temples that confront the paradox between the need for financial resources and spiritual values that disavow money. The findings show a series of cognitive mechanisms that reveal multiple roles of mindfulness, manifested as silence and skepticism of language. First, the monastic environment enables monks to become familiar with a life of silence that turns their attention to the inner mind from the external-empirical world. The silence serves as a mental buffer when monks switch between their sacred role and their business role. Over time, deep silence directs them to skepticism of language that triggers doubt on preexisting linguistic categories, boundaries, and separations. When the preexisting linguistic categories finally disappear in their mind, monks no longer rely on any differentiating or integrating tactic to navigate their paradox. In other words, they no longer perceive a paradox, which means the paradox has disappeared from their life. These cognitive mechanisms construct the monks’ worldview on contradictions, conflicts, and dualities, leading them from the experience of paradox to a unique mental state, the nonexperience of paradox. Integrating this mental state and the worldview of Buddhist monks with paradox research, this study theorizes a Buddhist mindfulness view of paradox.

Through in-depth interviews with professionals working with individuals suffering from various distressing conditions, events, and situations, I develop generalizable theoretical insights about interpersonal holding as a specific form of helping dedicated to surfacing, expanding, and integrating aspects of individuals’ selves that have receded amid distress. The findings indicate a sequence of holding behaviors marked by three overlapping phases: holders coming alongside, linking up with, and guiding individuals in distress through narrowed intrapsychic spaces. This sequence is enabled, first, by the availability of individuals to interpersonal holding and second, by aspects of the holders that stabilize them during the complicated work of attending to the agentic selves of others.

  abstract     = {We examine whether investors value workforce gender diversity. Consistent with the view that investors believe workforce gender diversity can be valuable in major firms, we use event studies to demonstrate that U.S. technology firms and financial firms experience more positive stock price reactions when it is revealed that they have relatively higher (versus lower) workforce gender diversity numbers. For instance, we find that Google’s revelation of relatively low workforce gender diversity numbers triggered a negative stock price reaction, whereas eBay’s revelation of relatively high workforce gender diversity numbers triggered a positive stock price reaction. These stock price reactions are both economically and statistically significant; for example, we estimate that if a technology firm had revealed gender diversity numbers that were one standard deviation higher, its market valuation would have increased by $1.11 billion. Corroborating this plausibly causal field evidence, we also find positive investor reactions to workforce gender diversity in randomized experiments using Prolific participants with investing experience; these reactions seem to be underpinned by investors’ beliefs about potential upsides of diversity for the firm (e.g., reduced legal risks; increased creativity) but not by investors’ beliefs about potential downsides of diversity for the firm (e.g., increased conflict). Our findings highlight the importance of understanding investors’ intuitions or beliefs about major organizational phenomena such as workforce gender diversity. Our results also point toward a new type of business case for diversity, driven by investors: if major firms had more workforce gender diversity, investors may “reward” them with substantially higher valuations.

However, at the organization level, practice abandonment can be a slow process. Organizations may continue to use a practice that is in decline or out of date, coupling asynchronously with a prior institutional environment. In this paper we develop the concept of temporal miscoupling and examine the challenges of performing a practice under this condition. Drawing on a field study of a labor strike in Canada, we examine the difficulties of inhabiting the practice of striking—picketing a workplace—with eroding political, legal, and cultural support; declining familiarity with the practice; and fading narratives to motivate and justify the practice. We show how strikers developed extemporaneous resources that gave local meaning and form to the practice. These improvised resources supported the practice but distorted historical meanings and performances. Our study expands the analytical repertoire of inhabited institutionalism by problematizing the temporal lag between institutional conditions and organizational practices for the on-the-ground enactment of practices. The extemporaneous resources generated in the context of temporal miscoupling threaten future enactments, indicating an important role for practice enactment in processes of decline and revitalization.

  abstract     = {The recent wave of corporate scandals has necessitated a more systematic investigation of internal whistle-blowing as a potential way to prevent wrongdoing. Our understanding of whistle-blowing, however, has been hampered by a deep chasm that exists between employees’ intent to blow the whistle and their whistle-blowing behaviors. We argue that to fully bridge this gap, we need to consider employees’ cognitive states at the time of whistle-blowing intentions versus behaviors and to link these cognitive states to the ethical systems within the organization’s ethical infrastructure to understand which systems are more effective in cultivating whistle-blowing intentions and which systems help translate those intentions into behaviors. Across one multisource field study and one multiwave experiment, we found support for our arguments that top management values-based communication systems, which are more high construal (abstract), affect whistle-blowing intentions whereas ethical accountability systems and ethical retaliatory systems, which are more low construal (concrete), moderate the relationship between whistle-blowing intentions and behaviors. By linking ethical systems within the organization’s ethical infrastructure to the two stages (intentions and behaviors) of the whistle-blowing process and the accompanying cognitive states, we develop and empirically test a construal level theory of internal whistle-blowing.

  abstract     = {Previous literature offers conflicting findings on how the restrictiveness of the regulatory environment—the amount of rules that prohibit specific activities—affects innovation of firms. One camp suggests that restrictiveness circumscribes the range of available technological components and therefore decreases innovation. The other camp believes that restrictiveness can lead firms to seek new alternative technological components, which could increase innovation. In this article, we develop a new theory on regulation and innovation to reconcile these views, which we test using novel data on federal regulations and the patents of 1,242 firms, from 1994 to 2013. We find that restrictiveness can have both a negative and positive relationship with innovation output depending on the level of regulatory uncertainty and the innovation type in question.

  abstract     = {Organizational research has documented that scandals lead to negative aggregate stakeholder reactions. There is little reason to believe, however, that the effects of a scandal are homogenous across different types of engagement. We therefore compare the effects of a scandal on member engagement in two types of rites at normative organizations: rites of integration and rites of passage. Rites of integration focus on the community, celebrate organizational values, and help strengthen organizational identification; they are thus enacted more by core members. Rites of passage focus on the individual, celebrate transition between social roles, and require only occasional engagement; they are thus enacted by core and peripheral members. Because of these differences, we hypothesize that a normative organization’s implication in a scandal affects rites of passage more negatively than rites of integration, but that this effect depends on scandal prevalence among neighboring organizations, organizational age, and organizational size. We test our hypotheses in the context of a child abuse scandal in the Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Using yearly parish-level data from 1990 to 2010, we find that a parish’s implication in the scandal was associated with a larger decline in rites of passage (marriages, baptisms, and funerals) than in rites of integration (mass attendance). This difference was reversed with the increase in scandal prevalence. Furthermore, rites of integration were more resilient than rites of passage at older and larger parishes. To help rule in the plausibility of our organization-level theory, we present a simulation grounded in individual-level polling data from the context.

  abstract     = {The precipitous growth of remote work has given rise to a new phenomenon: the emergence of relocation incentive programs that localities use to compete for the physical presence of remote workers. Remote workers with high general human capital may create value for their new destinations and reverse net talent outflow from smaller cities in middle America and globally. However, localities seeking to attract, retain, and create value from remote workers face significant challenges because such workers may have a low attachment to their new destination. Analogizing these challenges to the problem of creating and capturing value from workers with general human capital, we argue that localities can benefit from using relocation incentive program by leveraging location-specific attributes that create value for the individual and the locality. We examined these ideas in the context of Tulsa Remote, a program that provides relocation incentives and a bundle of services to increase engagement and embeddedness in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We found that Tulsa Remote increased community engagement, real income, and entrepreneurship of remote workers, benefiting both the community and the individual. Tulsa Remote increased the worker’s willingness to stay, and local community engagement is a key driver of this relationship. This work thus suggests that location specificity enables localities to both create and capture value from remote workers.

  abstract     = {We conduct an experiment to examine how providing decision makers with high versus low peer performance information influences choices between exploration and exploitation. Previous work on organization-level learning suggests that a high-performing peer would fuel exploration, whereas a low-performing peer would dampen it. In line with this, we find that individuals who receive information about a high-performing peer explore more than those who receive information about a low-performing peer. However, we also find that compared to individuals with a low tendency to self-enhance, individuals with a high tendency to self-enhance are less likely to explore when receiving information about a high-performing peer. In fact, these individuals explore at levels comparable to those who receive information about a low-performing peer. We explain this behavioral pattern by demonstrating that as individuals learn and improve, information about a high-performing peer increasingly results in mixed performance feedback; under these conditions of relative interpretive flexibility, exploration is moderated by decision makers’ tendency to self-enhance. When these individual dynamics are aggregated, our data suggest that an organization that provides peer performance information may experience either the same or less exploration than an organization that does not, with the exact difference depending on its proportion of high self-enhancers. These insights into the contingencies and aggregate effects of how individuals interpret and respond to peer performance information are particularly relevant given recent interest in designing organizations that shape employee behavior through the provision of feedback rather than through traditional instruments of coordination and control, such as incentives or hierarchy.

Previous studies offer conflicting predictions regarding the relationship, and much of the empirical evidence suffers from issues like selection, measurement error, reverse causality, and omitted variable bias. Leveraging a difference-in-differences design, we first examine quasirandom fluctuations in retailers’ financial resources resulting from large windfalls from selling winning lottery tickets. Our results suggest that an increase in financial resources from selling a large winning lottery ticket reduces retailers’ tobacco sales to minors. Next, to rule in strain theory and to rule out alternative explanations, we leverage a second natural experiment, heterogeneity analysis, an alternate measure of misconduct, and an online randomized experiment. In doing so, we provide plausibly causal evidence on the relationship between a firm’s financial resources and its propensity for misconduct and provide potentially useful findings for policymakers and regulators.

Using a two-stage model of evaluation (initial screening and subsequent assessment), we propose that exemplar similarity enhances a firm’s recognizability and legitimacy, increasing the likelihood that it passes the initial screening stage and attracts analyst coverage. However, exemplar similarity may also prompt unfavorable comparisons with exemplar firms, leading to lower analyst recommendations in the assessment stage. We further argue that category coherence, distinctiveness, and exemplar typicality influence the impact of exemplar similarity on firm evaluation. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a sample of 7,603 U.S. public firms from 1997 to 2022, we find robust support for our predictions. By highlighting the intricate role of strategic positioning vis-à-vis category exemplars in shaping audience evaluations, our findings have important implications for research on positioning relative to category exemplars, category viability, optimal distinctiveness, and security analysts.

  abstract     = {By studying three promising venture pairs with different business models in different nascent markets, we explore how some new firms grow into mature firms and some promising peers do not. The successful firms first use a learning process that begins with (1) focused attention on unit profitability (not growth), then broad (not narrow) learning, and finally active delay (not acceleration) of growth. They then use a capability-building process that (2) shifts to focused attention on unit-profitable growth, then makes long-term investments in profit-oriented capabilities, and finally leverages these capabilities into new products. In contrast, peers with focused attention on growth ironically fail to achieve it. Broadly, we contribute a process theory of exceptional growth that fills the gap between the growth of new firms in the entrepreneurship literature and the growth of mature firms in the strategy and organization theory literatures. Further, we add the importance of learning content —not just learning processes—to the entrepreneurship literature on new firm growth and a rare, novel, and grounded account of the origin of capabilities to the strategy literature on the resource-based view and mature firm growth. Finally, we add to practice the significance of product–market–profit fit and a precise definition of premature scaling .

  abstract     = {We examine the organizational impact of CEO initial contract duration on corporate acquisitions. We argue that CEOs with shorter initial contract durations are more likely to experience time pressure. Consequently, they are more likely to manage time by engaging in corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) to achieve quick growth. In addition, these CEOs are more likely to engage in straightforward deals, acquiring targets that are private, divested, related, small, and using cash payment, because these types of transactions are quicker to complete, carry less risk, and generally come with good performance prospects. Using a sample of firms that underwent new CEO appointments between 1990 and 2017 and detailed employment contract data collected from SEC filings, we find strong support for our hypotheses. In addition, we apply UK corporate governance reform to CEO contract duration as an exogenous shock to show causal evidence of such relations.

  abstract     = {Environmental jolts can trigger more conducive conditions for driving change in organizations. However, punctuated equilibrium theories of organizational change concentrate on top managers’ implementation of de novo radical changes after jolts. Existing research has not examined frontline-driven, incremental change efforts during these periods of disrupted stasis, despite the value of frontline change ideas. We develop a process model to explain how and when those on an organization’s front lines can leverage a jolt to opportunistically implement long-desired change ideas in ways that promote their retention. We conducted a two-year qualitative field study at a hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic, examining the trajectories of 33 premeditated change ideas raised by frontline staff. By comparing ideas that persisted to become part of normal operations with those that failed to be selected or retained, we identified practices and conditions that promoted the selection and retention of frontline change ideas. Our study suggests that frontline change advocates can seed the long-term retention of “shovel-ready” ideas—as opposed to de novo ideas—after a jolt by rapidly and opportunistically deploying a novel set of practices before the brief window of opportunity created by lessened constraints and increased managerial receptivity closes. Prior theories of change largely assume frontline-driven change to be slow and continuous, proceeding in a one-off fashion; we explain how and when frontline change can instead occur in rapid, opportunistic bursts. This study advances theories of punctuated equilibrium and bottom-up change in organizations by unearthing an alternative way that change can be intentionally accomplished in organizations.

  abstract     = {The strategy literature highlights the critical role that managerial attention plays in shaping firms’ responses to industry change. However, attention to change alone is not sufficient to precipitate action. The context in which this attention is paid is also critical in determining the translation of attention to action as managers generally pay attention to multiple issues within their strategic agendas. We argue that attention to a competing issue and the breadth of managerial strategic attention impair the relationship between attention to a focal issue and related organizational action as these attentional constraints may lead to hesitancy or confusion at an individual level and reduced coordination at an organizational level. Realizing that at an organizational level, firms vary tremendously with respect to their sizes, resources, and by implication their overall attentional capacities, we argue that the negative moderation impacts of attention to a competing issue and the breadth of strategic attention on the attention to a focal issue–subsequent action relationship are larger for smaller firms. Studying the U.S. electric utility industry and the emerging new distributed electricity generation business model, we find broad support for our arguments and also important nuance. By melding theory, important details of our empirical setting, and intriguing empirical results, we develop greater insights into when and how the other strategic issues to which managers pay attention can shape the translation of managerial attention to a new business model into subsequent organizational action.

  abstract     = {Despite the growing availability of algorithm-augmented work, algorithm aversion is prevalent among employees, hindering successful implementations of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) aids. Applying a social comparison perspective, this article examines the adverse effect of employees’ high performance ranking on their preimplementation attitudes toward the integration of powerful AI aids within their area of advantage. Five studies, using a weight estimation simulation (Studies 1–3), recall of actual job tasks (Study 4), and a workplace scenario (Study 5), provided consistent causal evidence for this effect by manipulating performance ranking (performance advantage compared with peers versus no advantage). Studies 3–4 revealed that this effect was driven in part by employees’ perceived potential loss of standing compared with peers, a novel social-based mechanism complementing the extant explanation operating via one’s confidence in own (versus AI) ability. Stronger causal evidence for this mechanism was provided in Study 5 using a “moderation-of-process” design. It showed that the adverse effect of high performance ranking on preimplementation AI attitudes was reversed when bolstering the stability of future performance rankings (presumably counteracting one’s concern with potential loss of standing). Finally, pointing to the power of symbolic threats, this adverse effect was evident both in the absence of financial incentives for high performance (Study 1) and in various incentive-based settings (Studies 2–3). Implications for understanding and managing high performers’ aversion toward the integration of powerful algorithmic aids are discussed. Funding: This work was supported by the Coller Foundation.
