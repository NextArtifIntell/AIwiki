  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore the applications of Tail Variance (TV) as a measure of tail riskiness and the confidence level of using Tail Conditional Expectation (TCE)-based risk capital. While TCE measures the expected loss of a risk that exceeds a certain threshold, TV measures the variability of risk along its tails. We first derive analytical formulas of TV and TCE for a large variety of probability distributions. These formulas are useful instruments for relevant research works on tail risk measures. We then propose a distribution-free approach utilizing TV to estimate the lower bounds of the confidence level of using TCE-based risk capital. In doing so, we introduce sharpened conditional probability inequalities, which halve the bounds of conventional Markov and Cantelli inequalities. Such an approach is easy to implement. We further investigate the characterization of tail risks by TV through an exploration of TV’s asymptotics. A distribution-free limit formula is derived for the asymptotics of TV. To further investigate the asymptotic properties, we consider two broad distribution families defined on tails, namely, the polynomial-tailed distributions and the exponential-tailed distributions. The two distribution families are found to exhibit an asymptotic equivalence between TV and the reciprocal square of the hazard rate. We also establish asymptotic relationships between TCE and VaR for the two families. Our asymptotic analysis contributes to the existing research by unifying the asymptotic expressions and the convergence rate of TV for Student-t distributions, exponential distributions, and normal distributions, which complements the discussion on the convergence rate of univariate cases in [28]. To show the usefulness of our results, we present two case studies based on real data from the industry. We first show how to use conditional inequalities to assess the confidence of using TCE-based risk capital for different types of insurance businesses. Then, for financial data, we provide alternative evidence for the relationship between the data frequency and the tail categorization by the asymptotics of TV.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a joint drift rate control and two-sided impulse control problem in which the system manager adjusts the drift rate as well as the instantaneous relocation for a Brownian motion, with the objective of minimizing the total average state-related cost and control cost. The system state can be negative. Assuming that instantaneous upward and downward relocations take a different cost structure, which consists of both a setup cost and a variable cost, we prove that the optimal control policy takes an $\left\{ {\!\left( {{s^{\ast}},{q^{\ast}},{Q^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}} \right),\!\left\{ {{\mu ^{\ast}}(x)\,:\,x \in [ {{s^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}}]} \right\}} \right\}$ form. Specifically, the optimal impulse control policy is characterized by a quadruple $\left( {{s^{\ast}},{q^{\ast}},{Q^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}} \right)$ , under which the system state will be immediately relocated upwardly to ${q^{\ast}}$ once it drops to ${s^{\ast}}$ and be immediately relocated downwardly to ${Q^{\ast}}$ once it rises to ${S^{\ast}}$ ; the optimal drift rate control policy will depend solely on the current system state, which is characterized by a function ${\mu ^{\ast}}\!\left( \cdot \right)$ for the system state staying in $[ {{s^{\ast}},{S^{\ast}}}]$ . By analyzing an associated free boundary problem consisting of an ordinary differential equation and several free boundary conditions, we obtain these optimal policy parameters and show the optimality of the proposed policy using a lower-bound approach. Finally, we investigate the effect of the system parameters on the optimal policy parameters as well as the optimal system’s long-run average cost numerically.},

The optimal stopping times forming a Nash equilibrium are shown to be the first times at which the original process hits certain boundaries depending on the running values of the associated maximum and minimum processes. The proof is based on the reduction of the original game to the equivalent coupled free-boundary problem and the solution of the latter problem by means of the smooth-fit and normal-reflection conditions. We show that the optimal stopping boundaries are partially determined as either unique solutions to the appropriate system of arithmetic equations or unique solutions to the appropriate first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes single-item continuous-review inventory models with random supplies in which the inventory dynamic between orders is described by a diffusion process, and a long-term average cost criterion is used to evaluate decisions. The models in this class have general drift and diffusion coefficients and boundary points that are consistent with the notion that demand should tend to reduce the inventory level. Random yield is described by a (probability) transition function which depends on the inventory on hand and the nominal amount ordered; it is assumed to be a distribution with support in the interval determined by the order-from and the nominal order-to locations of the stock level. Using weak convergence arguments involving average expected occupation and ordering measures, conditions are given for the optimality of an ( s , S ) ordering policy in the general class of policies with finite expected cost. The characterization of the cost of an ( s , S ) policy as a function of two variables naturally leads to a nonlinear optimization problem over the stock levels s and S , and the existence of an optimizing pair $(s^*,S^*)$ is established under weak conditions. Thus, optimal policies of inventory models with random supplies can (easily) be numerically computed. The range of applicability of the optimality result is illustrated on several inventory models with random yields.},

This paper studies how the perturbation of MCMC affects the convergence speed and approximation accuracy. Our results show that when the original Markov chain converges to stationarity fast enough and the perturbed transition kernel is a good approximation to the original transition kernel, the corresponding perturbed sampler has fast convergence speed and high approximation accuracy as well. Our convergence analysis is conducted under either the Wasserstein metric or the $\chi^2$ metric, both are widely used in the literature. The results can be extended to obtain non-asymptotic error bounds for MCMC estimators. We demonstrate how to apply our convergence and approximation results to the analysis of specific sampling algorithms, including Random walk Metropolis, Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm with perturbed target densities, and parallel tempering Monte Carlo with perturbed densities. Finally, we present some simple numerical examples to verify our theoretical claims.},

As a second contribution, we investigate the ergodic properties in the special case where the jumps consist of births and deaths, a situation observed in several applications including epidemiology, ecology, and microbiology. Based on a coupling argument, we obtain conditions for convergence to a stationary measure with a geometric rate of convergence. Throughout the article, we illustrate our results using general examples of systems of interacting particles in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with births and deaths. We show that in some cases the stationary measure can be made explicit and corresponds to a Gibbs measure on a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ .

The de Finetti measure describes the interaction between voters and possible outside influences on them. We assume that for each population size there is a (potentially) different de Finetti measure, and as the population grows, the sequence of de Finetti measures converges weakly to the Dirac measure at the origin, representing a tendency toward weakening social cohesion as the population grows large. The resulting model covers a wide variety of behaviours, ranging from independent voting in the limit under fast convergence, a critical convergence speed with its own pattern of behaviour, to a subcritical convergence speed which yields a model in line with empirical evidence of real-world voting data, contrary to previous probabilistic models used in the study of voting.

The second main result relaxes the distributional assumption and concerns the ${\mathbb{Z}}[x]$ -module structure. The motivation for this work arises from an open problem in spectral graph theory, which asks to show that random graphs are often determined up to isomorphism by their (generalised) spectrum. Sufficient conditions for generalised spectral determinacy can, namely, be stated in terms of the cokernel of a walk matrix. Extensions of our results could potentially be used to determine how often those conditions are satisfied. Some remaining challenges for such extensions are outlined in the paper.},

Given a degree sequence $\textbf{d}=(d_1,\ldots, d_n)$ , let ${\mathcal G}(n,\textbf{d})$ denote a uniformly random graph with degree sequence $\textbf{d}$ . We couple ${\mathcal G}(n,W)$ and ${\mathcal G}(n,\textbf{d})$ together so that asymptotically almost surely ${\mathcal G}(n,W)$ is a subgraph of ${\mathcal G}(n,\textbf{d})$ , where $W$ is some function of $\textbf{d}$ . Let $\Delta (\textbf{d})$ denote the maximum degree in $\textbf{d}$ . Our coupling result is optimal when $\Delta (\textbf{d})^2\ll \|\textbf{d}\|_1$ , that is, $W_{ij}$ is asymptotic to ${\mathbb P}(ij\in{\mathcal G}(n,\textbf{d}))$ for every $i,j\in [n]$ . We also have coupling results for $\textbf{d}$ that are not constrained by the condition $\Delta (\textbf{d})^2\ll \|\textbf{d}\|_1$ . For such $\textbf{d}$ our coupling result is still close to optimal, in the sense that $W_{ij}$ is asymptotic to ${\mathbb P}(ij\in{\mathcal G}(n,\textbf{d}))$ for most pairs $ij\in \binom{[n]}{2}$ .},

  abstract     = {We study computational aspects of repulsive Gibbs point processes, which are probabilistic models of interacting particles in a finite-volume region of space. We introduce an approach for reducing a Gibbs point process to the hard-core model, a well-studied discrete spin system. Given an instance of such a point process, our reduction generates a random graph drawn from a natural geometric model. We show that the partition function of a hard-core model on graphs generated by the geometric model concentrates around the partition function of the Gibbs point process. Our reduction allows us to use a broad range of algorithms developed for the hard-core model to sample from the Gibbs point process and approximate its partition function. This is, to the extent of our knowledge, the first approach that deals with pair potentials of unbounded range.},

A conjecture of Lovász and Simonovits from the 1970s states that, for every $r\ge 3$ , if $n$ is sufficiently large then, for every $e\le \binom{n}{2}$ , at least one extremal graph can be obtained from a complete partite graph by adding a triangle-free graph into one part. In this note, we explicitly write the minimum number of $r$ -cliques predicted by the above conjecture. Also, we describe what we believe to be the set of extremal graphs for any $r\ge 4$ and all large $n$ , amending the previous conjecture of Pikhurko and Razborov.},

  abstract     = {We consider the community detection problem in sparse random hypergraphs under the non-uniform hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM), a general model of random networks with community structure and higher-order interactions. When the random hypergraph has bounded expected degrees, we provide a spectral algorithm that outputs a partition with at least a $\gamma$ fraction of the vertices classified correctly, where $\gamma \in (0.5,1)$ depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the model. When the SNR grows slowly as the number of vertices goes to infinity, our algorithm achieves weak consistency, which improves the previous results in Ghoshdastidar and Dukkipati ((2017) Ann. Stat. 45 (1) 289–315.) for non-uniform HSBMs. Our spectral algorithm consists of three major steps: (1) Hyperedge selection: select hyperedges of certain sizes to provide the maximal signal-to-noise ratio for the induced sub-hypergraph; (2) Spectral partition: construct a regularised adjacency matrix and obtain an approximate partition based on singular vectors; (3) Correction and merging: incorporate the hyperedge information from adjacency tensors to upgrade the error rate guarantee. The theoretical analysis of our algorithm relies on the concentration and regularisation of the adjacency matrix for sparse non-uniform random hypergraphs, which can be of independent interest.},

By using multilayer perceptrons as agents, we create more realistic ABMs that better reflect actual agents. This approach yields multiple models, as core elements of the HK model can be defined in various ways.

  abstract     = {There has been increased attention on how scientific communities should respond to spurious dissent. One proposed method is to hide such dissent by preventing its publication. To investigate this, I computationally model the epistemic effects of hiding dissenting evidence on scientific communities. I find that it is typically epistemically harmful to hide dissent, even when there exists an agent purposefully producing biased dissent. However, hiding dissent also allows for quicker correct epistemic consensus among scientists. Quicker consensus may be important when policy decisions must be made quickly, such as during a pandemic, suggesting times when hiding dissent may be useful.},

  abstract     = {This essay introduces, develops, and appraises the mitonuclear compatibility species concept (MCSC), identifying advantages and limitations with respect to alternative species concepts. While the consensus amongst most philosophers of biology is that (kind) essentialism about species is mistaken, and that species at most have relational essences, we appeal to the MCSC to defend thoroughgoing intrinsic essentialism. Namely, the doctrine that species have fully intrinsic essences and, thus, are natural kinds (of sorts), while allowing that species aren’t categorically distinct.},

  abstract     = {How do opinion diversity and belief polarisation affect epistemic group decision-making, particularly if decisions must be made without delay and on the basis of permissive evidence? In an agent-based model, we track the consistency of group opinions aggregated through sentence-wise majority voting. Simulations on the model reveal that high opinion diversity, but not polarisation, incurs a significant inconsistency risk. These results indicate that epistemic group decisions based on permissive evidence can be particularly difficult for diverse groups. The results also improve our understanding of what can reasonably be expected of expert groups, and where expert advice might have limits.},

  abstract     = {One type of computational indeterminacy arises from partitioning a system’s physical state space into state types that correspond to the abstract state types underlying the computation concerned. The mechanistic individuative strategy posits that computation can be uniquely identified through either narrow physical properties exclusively or wide, proximal properties. The semantic strategy posits that computation should be uniquely identified through semantic properties. We develop, and defend, an alternative functional individuative strategy that appeals—when needed—to wide, distal functions. We claim that there is no actual computation outside of a functional context. Desiderata for the underlying notion of teleofunction are discussed.},

They also have the social responsibility of aligning their research with the needs and values of various societal stakeholders. Individual scientists may be left with no guidance on how to prioritize and carry these different responsibilities. As I will argue, however, the responsibilities of science can be harmonized at the collective level. Drawing from debates in moral philosophy, I will propose a theory of the collective responsibilities of science that accounts for the internal diversity of research groups and for their different responsibilities.},
