First, consensus-based adaptive Nash equilibrium seeking is studied for first-order nonlinear systems with parameter uncertainties. The case of high-order systems with mismatched parameter uncertainties and nonlinearities is then considered, and a distributed adaptive Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm is designed by incorporating the celebrated adaptive backstepping technique. Under the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proved that the players&#39; actions can globally asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium by the proposed seeking strategies. Finally, simulation results show the validness of the seeking strategies.},

  abstract     = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are a widely used technology for positioning and navigation. GNSS positioning relies on pseudorange measurements from satellites to receivers. A pseudorange is the apparent distance between two agents deduced from the time-of-flight of a signal sent from one agent to the other, because of the lack of synchronization between the agents&#39; clocks, it is a biased version of their distance. In this article, we introduce a new rigidity theory adapted to pseudorange measurements. The peculiarity of pseudoranges is that they are asymmetrical measurements. Therefore, unlike other usual rigidities, the graphs of pseudorange frameworks are directed. In this article, pseudorange rigidity is proved to be a generic property of the underlying undirected graph of constraints. The main result is a characterization of rigid pseudorange graphs as combinations of rigid distance graphs and connected graphs. This new theory is adapted for GNSS. It provides new insights into the minimum number of satellites needed to locate a receiver and is applied to the localization of GNSS cooperative networks of receivers. The interests of asymmetrical constraints in the context of formation control are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous inverter-based microgrids present new operational challenges, as the stabilizing inertia of synchronous generators is absent. The design of efficient control policies for grid-forming inverters is, however, a nontrivial problem where multiple control objectives need to be satisfied. We consider the problem of designing a controller that achieves desirable objectives. We propose in this article a decentralized polytopic control design that yields a state feedback voltage controller that stabilizes the inverters in the presence of droop-like controllers aiming to achieve power sharing. The voltage controller is synthesized via a convex optimization problem that uses a detailed nonlinear inverter model, where the nonlinearities are taken into account via a quasi-linear parameter-varying formulation. Our control design guarantees stability and plug-and-play capability via a decentralized condition with passivity properties, and appropriate performance specifications are satisfied, including voltage tracking capability, restricted control input, and robustness to state deviations. Our approach allows using a user-defined operating point, and through the polytopic control design, it allows us to take into account the bounds on the inverter state deviations. The performance of the controller is illustrated via simulations with detailed nonlinear models in a realistic setting.},

The advantage of the controller in this article lies in its robustness against random disturbances, which unavoidably exist in real networks because of environmental changes. Moreover, the proposed ETC effectively reduces energy consumption, because it achieves the control objective using the shortest possible time without unnecessary updates of the feedback gain. First, robust synchronization is equivalently converted to robust set stabilization of an augmented PBN using the semitensor product. Second, a feasible algorithm is presented to calculate the largest robust control invariant set of a given set, based on which a necessary and sufficient condition is developed for the existence of event-triggered controllers. Then, a detailed configuration of all feasible controllers is provided by a constructive algorithm. Under some mild conditions, global controllers are designed to further reduce computation load.

We consider a group of agents that communicate over a strongly connected, aperiodic graph and do not have any knowledge of the system dynamics. Each agent only measures some signals that are linear functions of the system states or inputs, and does not know the functional form of this dependence. The proposed distributed algorithm consists of two steps that rely on the collected data: first, the identification of an unforced trajectory of the system, and second, the estimation of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the system matrix using this unforced trajectory. We show that each step can be formulated as a problem of finding a common solution to a set of linear algebraic equations, which are amenable to distributed algorithmic solutions. We prove that under mild assumptions on the collected data, when the initial condition of the system is random, the proposed distributed algorithm accurately estimates the spectrum with probability 1.},

To characterize the generation power against the fuel cost, we denote various fuel choices by segmented nonconvex costs. To help address the lack of prior knowledge of the system model, we propose a novel distributed actor–critic algorithm to find the feasible power. The algorithm combines the actor policy network with the multiplier splitting approach and projected gradient method, maps the action&#39;s policy distribution to a feasible power interval, and finally realizes real-time dispatching in continuous action space by approximating the evaluation function from the critic network. The convergence of the algorithm is theoretically analyzed. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by several simulations.},

A key reason for this reluctance could be the competitive advantage that comes with lax regulation. A popular platform that starts enforcing content moderation rules may fear that it could lose users to less-regulated alternative platforms. Moreover, if users continue harmful activities on other platforms, regulation ends up being futile. This article examines the competitive aspect of content moderation by considering the motivations of all involved players (platformer, news source, and social media users), identifying the regulation policies sustained in equilibrium, and evaluating the information quality available on each platform. Applied to simple yet relevant social networks, such as stochastic block models, our model reveals the conditions for a popular platform to enforce strict regulation without losing users. Effectiveness of regulation depends on the diffusive property of news posts, friend interaction qualities in social media, the sizes and cohesiveness of communities, and how much sympathizers appreciate surprising news from influencers.},

To enhance the rapidity of the systems, a distributed bang–bang control algorithm is introduced with communication delays. It is shown that all trains will eventually achieve stable operation with a desired velocity while remaining in the self-adjusting zones in the absence of communication delays or remaining in the neighborhood of the self-adjusting zones in the presence of communication delays.

Numerous approaches to manage this impact have been proposed, ranging from stochastic and chance-constrained programming to robust optimization. However, these approaches either tend to be conservative or leave the system vulnerable to low-probability, high-impact uncertainty realizations. To address this issue, we propose a new formulation for stochastic optimal power flow that explicitly distinguishes between “normal operation,” in which automatic generation control (AGC) is sufficient to guarantee system security, and “adverse operation,” in which the system operator is required to take additional actions, e.g., manual reserve deployment. The new formulation has been compared with the classical ones in a case study on the IEEE-118 and IEEE-300 bus systems. We observe that our consideration of extreme scenarios enables solutions that are more secure than typical chance-constrained formulations, yet less costly than solutions that guarantee robust feasibility with only AGC.},

However, despite significant research on distributed optimization for single-layer networks, similar progress is lacking for multilayer systems. This article proposes two algorithms for distributed optimization problems in multiplex networks using the supra-Laplacian matrix and its diffusion dynamics. The algorithms include a distributed saddle-point algorithm and its variation as a distributed gradient descent algorithm. By relating consensus and diffusion dynamics, we obtain the multiplex supra-Laplacian matrix. We extend the distributed gradient descent algorithm for multiplex networks using this matrix and analyze the convergence of both algorithms with several theoretical results. Numerical examples validate our proposed algorithms, and we explore the impact of interlayer diffusion on consensus time. We also present a coordinated dispatch for interdependent infrastructure networks (energy–gas) to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework to real engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {With an escalating emphasis on distributed economic dispatch within microgrid systems due to its inherent adaptability, scalability, and sustainability, an extensive focus on the confidentiality of this field is pronouncedly emerging. The primary emphasis of this study is the safeguarding of power-sensitive information in the distributed economic dispatch issue prevalent in microgrids. This pursuit leads us to the development of a distributed optimization algorithm that preserves privacy, tailored for directed networks. The algorithm strives to secure a balance between supply and demand at the lowest economic cost, all while adhering to real-world constraints and maintaining the confidentiality of power-sensitive information. To fulfill this objective, we propose a novel privacy-preserving distributed algorithm that capitalizes on the inherent resilience exhibited by system dynamics toward uncertainty. Specifically, to ensure privacy preservation, we strategically incorporate randomness into the mixing weights, thereby generating a degree of uncertainty in communication messages during the initial iteration. Rigorous analysis is built to delineate that our method can achieve exact convergence and ensure the confidentiality of power-sensitive information. Further, additional numerical trials conducted on an IEEE 14-bus system substantiate the algorithm&#39;s practical efficiency.},

Difficulty in achieving formation control is exacerbated when agents are unable to access their absolute attitudes relative to a common frame of reference, and initial attitude matrices are required to be restricted to special sets. Addressing this issue, we present a distributed fixed-time attitude synchronization law, which utilizes only relative attitude measurements to align the agents&#39; coordinate frames almost globally in finite time and locally in fixed time. The proposed law ensures the global asymptotic convergence of formation tracking error for displacement-based formation control in a leader–follower topology. We also establish global uniformly asymptotic stability for bearing-only formation tracking. A Lyapunov-based attitude estimation algorithm is proposed to estimate the attitudes up to a common reference frame in finite time without using Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization. For nonholonomic agents, formation stabilization in agents&#39; local coordinate frame is studied using these attitude estimates and bearing-only measurements.

Following such adverse events, we investigate scenarios where a node of a linear network suffers a loss of control authority over some of its actuators. These actuators are not following the controller&#39;s commands and are instead producing undesirable outputs. The repercussions of such a loss of control can propagate and destabilize the whole network despite the malfunction occurring at a single node. To assess system vulnerability, we establish resilience conditions for networks with a subsystem enduring a loss of control authority over some of its actuators. Furthermore, we quantify the destabilizing impact on the overall network when such a malfunction perturbs a nonresilient subsystem. We illustrate our resilience conditions on two academic examples, on an islanded microgrid and on the linearized IEEE 39-bus system.},

Depending on the data-buffer-aided mechanism, a novel dynamic-memory event-triggered protocol is proposed to modulate the transmission frequency by drawing into historically released packets and two auxiliary internal dynamic variables. Then, a suitable event-triggered adaptive sliding-mode control strategy is developed to actualize the reachability of the specified integral sliding surface, which is capable of diminishing the impacts of model uncertainties. Stochastic admissibility and strict dissipativity conditions of closed-loop fuzzy implicit Markov jump systems are derived under the framework of linear matrix inequalities.

The algorithms rely on event-driven updates in order to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage. Finally, once the algorithms converge, nodes distributively terminate their operation. We prove that our algorithms converge in a finite number of iterations to the exact optimal solution depending on the quantization level, and we present applications of our algorithms to, first, optimal task scheduling for data centers, and second, global model aggregation for distributed federated learning.

We also examine an associated problem where every robot is limited by payload, budget, and communication to pick no more than a specified number of relative position measurements. The basic underlying formulation for these problems is nonlinear and is known to be NP-hard. Our approach formulates this problem as a mixed-integer semidefinite program, later reformulated into a mixed-integer linear program for obtaining optimal solutions using cutting plane algorithms. We introduce a novel upper bounding algorithm based on the principal minor characterization of positive semidefinite matrices and discuss a degree-constrained lower bounding formulation inspired by robust network structures.

Most of the existing research on the coordination control of multiple PDE systems assumes that the communication topology is undirected and that communication between neighboring agents is continuous, leading to significant consumption of communication resources. However, in this study, the communication topology among the virtual leader and followers is described by a directed graph, where the leader&#39;s reference signal is accessible only to a subset of the followers. Moreover, an event-triggering mechanism is proposed to avoid continuous signal transmission among agents, effectively mitigating the communication burden. An adaptive boundary control scheme based on filters is designed for each following flexible manipulator to track the leader&#39;s angle and eliminate unexpected vibrations in the presence of unknown external disturbances. All the signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded. Simulation results show that the presented control scheme is effective.},

For dependent attacks, a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee the unboundedness of the estimation error was obtained. Then, the problem of designing dependent attacks is further analyzed. Different suboptimal attack strategies are provided by solving nonconvex problem or transforming the nonconvex problem into a convex one. It is worth noting that all the attack signals concerned in this article are independent of real-time data of system operation, thus can be designed offline and be easier for application.

  abstract     = {Ambient monitoring through remote sensing is the first required step of many control operations in cyber-physical systems to enable accurate decision-making by network intelligence. We consider a controller that sends status updates about a process to a receiver, incurring a cost when doing so. The process is dynamic, implying that the information the receiver has may become outdated due to a natural drift of the process. To determine the correctness of the information at the receiver, we model this interaction using a Markov chain with two states, namely, right (R) and wrong (W). The controller can restore the receiver status to R by performing a new transmission, which comes at a cost. The staleness of information, when the system state is erroneous, is quantified through the average value of the age of incorrect information metric. Moreover, an adversary may inject false data at a price to make the information available at the receiver less fresh, which can only be contrasted by additional measurements by the controller. This results in a game played by strategic agents, namely, the controller and the adversary. The adversary&#39;s objective is to maximize the time the receiver is in the W state of the Markov chain, while the controller&#39;s objective is to minimize it. We provide a mathematical formulation of this strategic interaction using game-theory, demonstrating the existence of a Nash equilibrium. In our analysis, we discuss the role of different system parameters and the implications on the resulting system performance, providing a quantitative evaluation of the parameter ranges where an adversary can be effectively counteracted is an important guideline to improve the security of cyber-physical systems.},

Despite their beneficiary effects, matters, such as communication scheduling, have been proposed due to the aperiodic execution manner. In this work, we focus on constructing an abstracted system, named traffic model. This model can capture the sampling behaviors generated by a DPETC system and is equivalent to a timed automaton. During the construction, we first confine the infinite state space to a finite number of regions. Then, the interevent interval related to each region is calculated by the linear matrix inequality technique. Finally, the reachability analysis is used to locate state transitions between different regions. A numerical example demonstrates the validity of the proposed construction approach.},

Second, the radial basis function neural networks are utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions online to compensate for the system uncertainty. Furthermore, combining the neural network approximation mechanism and the adaptive communication policy of time-varying unknown weights, a novel fully distributed adaptive cooperative–antagonistic control strategy is presented to achieve the leader-following BI-consensus. The theoretical results show that the followers can reach the BI-consensus concerning the leader in both undirected and directed signed graphs.

First, the event-triggered zonotope is proposed to enclose the system state, where the observer gain only updates with the switching signal at triggering instants. The restriction on the switching signal is removed such that system switchings can happen more than once over each interevent interval. Then, specific iteration procedures are provided for the generator matrix in synchronous and asynchronous intervals. Solvable conditions are proposed to jointly optimize the event-triggered parameters and observer gains by constructing observer-mode-dependent radius functions. The boundedness and ${\mathcal {L}}_{\infty }$ performance are analyzed for the radius of the zonotope under restricted switchings.

In this article, we improve a recent hierarchical OPF algorithm that rested on primal–dual gradients evaluated with a linearized distribution power flow model. Specifically, we propose a more accurate gradient evaluation method based on an unbalanced three-phase nonlinear distribution power flow model to mitigate the errors arising from linearization. The resultant gradients feature a blocked structure that enables our development of an improved hierarchical primal–dual algorithm to solve the OPF problem. Numerical results on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder and a 4518-node test feeder show that the proposed method can enhance voltage safety at comparable computational efficiency with the linearized algorithm.},

We show that all the control laws together achieve semiglobal bipartite output consensus. Furthermore, we present a Q-learning algorithm to obtain both the low-gain parameter and the feedback gain matrix in the control law. We also present an online output-tracking-error-based updating algorithm to obtain the feedforward gain matrix in the control law. Thus, these control laws no more rely on the dynamics of linear systems. We show that the input saturation during the online updating algorithm does not affect the convergence of the algorithm. The control laws calculated from the model-free algorithms can prevent input saturation from occurring, and thus, the heterogeneous multiagent systems achieve global bipartite output consensus.

Complex frequency represents the rate of change of voltage amplitude and phase angle by its real and imaginary parts, respectively. This emerging notion is of significance as it accommodates the multivariable characteristics of power networks, where active power and reactive power are inherently coupled with both voltage amplitude and phase. We propose the notion of complex-frequency synchronization to study the phase–amplitude multivariable stability issue in a power system with dispatchable virtual oscillator-controlled converters. To achieve this, we separate the system into linear fast dynamics and approximately linear slow dynamics. The linearity property makes it tractable to analyze fast complex-frequency synchronization and slower voltage stabilization. From the perspective of complex frequency and complex-frequency synchronization, we provide novel insights into the equivalence of dispatchable virtual oscillator control and complex-power–frequency droop control, stability analysis methods, and stability criteria. Our study offers a practical solution to address challenging stability issues in converter-based power systems.},

For each SS, the corresponding global cost function is constructed based on a linear combination of all SSs’ local cost functions. The optimal control signal of each SS is obtained using its constructed corresponding global cost function. Sufficient conditions are provided on the sampling time, which guarantees the recursive feasibility of the proposed CDMPC approach. Moreover, sufficient conditions are presented, which guarantees that the deviation of the state variables, control inputs, and outputs of the LS system (LSS) converge to the origin and, consequently, guarantees closed-loop stability.

We formulate a Nash-minmax strategy, where the interactions of players in the same agent are nonzero-sum, while interactions of players between agents are antagonistic (e.g., zero-sum game). That is, the players in each agent minimize their costs, while the players from neighboring agents go against and maximize the costs. This approach finds the Nash control solutions for players within each agent and the worst control solutions for players in neighboring agents. The asymptotic stability under mild conditions and Nash-minmax solutions are guaranteed in the games. Offline policy iteration and online data-driven off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms are proposed, with proven convergence, to compute the Nash-minmax solutions.

We consider a practical information structure where each node has local information and some common information obtained from overhearing. We approach the problem via two steps: 1) we show that it is sufficient for the policy to be “greedy” and “exhaustive”; limiting the policy to this class reduces the problem to obtaining a queue switching policy at queue emptiness instants; and 2) by formulating the delay optimal scheduling as a partially observed Markov decision process, we show that the optimal switching rule is stochastic largest queue. Using this theory as the basis, we develop a practical, tunable, distributed scheduler, QZMAC, which is an extension to the existing ZMAC protocol. We implement QZMAC on standard off-the-shelf TelosB motes and also use simulations to compare QZMAC with the full-knowledge centralized scheduler and with ZMAC. We use our implementation to study the impact of false detection, while overhearing the common information, and the efficiency of QZMAC.

In view of the fact that the system dynamics of CPSs are usually high dimensional, coupled, and unknown, this article studies the privacy enhancement of CPSs by optimizing the injection direction of artificial noises with data-driven technologies. However, as the excitation signals, artificial noises and their direction matrix are given in advance. Therefore, optimizing the noise direction matrix will lead to the re-excitation of CPSs, which is a significant challenge for the data-driven privacy enhancement. To solve this problem, a searchable virtual noise space is introduced to jointly design the controller gain and noise injection direction with the data-driven parameterization method. Then, the privacy of monitored data is optimally enhanced to prevent eavesdroppers from obtaining real data, while ensuring that the influence of the noises on the system performance remains below a specified level. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft model, and the simulation results show that the privacy of monitored data is greatly enhanced under a slight loss of the control performance.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with designing an encrypted observer-based controller for linear continuous-time systems. To be specific, this article deploys a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme to directly compute control inputs in an encrypted form without decryption, thus avoiding data eavesdropping. Note that the deployment of FHE in observer-based controllers inevitably faces challenges in handling quantization errors due to the quantization required by the encryption–decryption processes. This motivates us to propose a novel encrypted form for computations of the continuous-time controller and present rigorous stability analysis based on its virtual dynamics. Consequently, stability criteria are formulated in terms of tractable conditions associated with quantization gains and sampling intervals. Numerical results on dc motor control corresponding to several quantization gains and sampling intervals demonstrate the validity of our method.},

The learning MAS does not have prior knowledge of the cost function of the target MAS and aims to reconstruct it based on the target&#39;s demonstrations. We propose a scalable model-free IRL algorithm for a large-scale MAS, where dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) extracts dynamic modes and builds a projection matrix. This significantly reduces the data required while retaining the system&#39;s essential dynamic information. The proofs of the algorithm&#39;s convergence, stability, and nonuniqueness of the state reward weight are presented.

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop distributed computation algorithms for Nash equilibriums of linear–quadratic network games with proven differential privacy guarantees. In a network game with each player&#39;s payoff being a quadratic function, the dependencies of the decisions in the payoff function naturally encode a network structure governing the players&#39; interpersonal influences. Such social influence structure and the individual marginal payoffs of the players indicate economic spillovers and individual preferences, and thus, they are subject to privacy concerns. For distributed computing of the Nash equilibrium, the players are interconnected by a public communication graph, over which dynamical states are shared among neighboring nodes. When the players&#39; marginal payoffs are considered to be private knowledge, we propose a distributed randomized gradient descent algorithm, in which each player adds a Laplacian random noise to her marginal payoff in the recursive updates. It is proven that the algorithm can guarantee differential privacy and convergence in expectation to the Nash equilibrium of the network game at each player&#39;s state. Moreover, the mean-square error between the players&#39; states and the Nash equilibrium is shown to be bounded by a constant related to the differential privacy level. Next, when both the players&#39; marginal payoffs and the influence graph are private information, we propose two distributed algorithms by randomized communication and randomized projection, respectively, for privacy preservation. The differential privacy and convergence guarantees are also established for such algorithms.},

As we show, beyond certain coupling thresholds, the systems within each module synchronize rapidly with a weighted-average dynamical system that evolves more slowly than the individual systems. Then, the average dynamical systems corresponding to each and all the modules synchronize among themselves. Furthermore, we establish global asymptotic stability for the overall network under the conditions that the average dynamics admit the origin as a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium and each system be semipassive.

In order to capture the characteristics and interactions of the three phases, a group of coupled performance indexes is designed, based on which a backward strategy design mechanism is proposed, i.e., following the sequence of formation control $\rightarrow$ path planning $\rightarrow$ task allocation to obtain the optimal strategy of each phase. The proposed framework makes the strategies to be designed in a closed-loop form and the performance of each phase to be bidirectionally adjustable. It is rigorously proved that the designed strategies can achieve the desired performance of each phase, as well as the Gestalt Nash equilibrium of the integrated game.

  abstract     = {An optimal event-driven containment control problem is studied for partially unknown nonlinear multiagent systems with input constraints and state constraints. Its novelty lies in the optimization of the performance index while ensuring constraints handling abilities on states and inputs. First, an improved discounted cost function is constructed, and the state and input constraint information are encoded into the cost function by barrier functions and nonquadratic utility functions, respectively. Then, the approximate distributed optimal containment control policy is derived by an integral reinforcement learning (IRL)-based adaptive critic design, where the IRL technique can overcome the limitation of known drift dynamics in previous results. In critic neural networks learning, the weight tuning law is presented by virtue of the concurrent learning technique, which relaxes the persistence of excitation conditions by storing appropriate historical data. In order to reduce the amount of information transmitted through the controller-to-actuator channel, a containment error-dependent dynamic event-triggered mechanism is defined. Theoretical results indicate that signals in closed-loop systems driven by event-triggered optimal controllers are uniformly ultimately bounded, and Zeno behavior is avoided.

In particular, the proposed control protocols are differentiable, namely, chattering-free, which do not comprise the conventional discontinuous absolute value and/or signum functions anymore. Therefore, the undesirable chattering problem is effectively overcome.

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel algorithm for solving network utility maximization (NUM) problems that arise in resource allocation schemes over networks with known safety-critical constraints, where the constraints form an arbitrary convex and compact feasible set. Inspired by applications where customers&#39; demand can only be affected through posted prices and real-time two-way communication with customers is not available, we require an algorithm to generate “safe prices.” This means that at no iteration should the realized demand in response to the posted prices violate the safety constraints of the network. Thus, in contrast to existing distributed first-order methods, our algorithm, called safe pricing for NUM (SPNUM), is guaranteed to produce feasible primal iterates at all iterations. At the heart of the algorithm lie two key steps that must go hand in hand to guarantee safety and convergence: first, applying a projected gradient method on a shrunk feasible set to get the desired demand, and second, estimating the price response function of the users and determining the price so that the induced demand is close to the desired demand. We ensure safety by adjusting the shrinkage to account for the error between the induced demand and the desired demand. In addition, by gradually reducing the amount of shrinkage and the step size of the gradient method, we prove that the primal iterates produced by the SPNUM achieve a sublinear static regret of ${\mathcal O}(\log {(T)})$ after $T$ time steps.},

Specifically, an event-triggered distributed consensus estimator is proposed to estimate the leaders&#39; system matrices and the convex hulls spanned by the leaders while ensuring the exclusion of Zeno behavior. Based on the proposed estimator, we establish an approximate optimal distributed control protocol for each follower to achieve output group formation tracking, which can be solved by the designed data-driven policy iteration algorithm.

The edge-based representation framework is utilized and two strict Lyapunov functions are constructed to show that the initial edges can be maintained under the proposed control protocols. Furthermore, the fixed-time consensus is achieved, where all of the states reach a common value within a finite time, which is upper bounded regardless of initial states.

The control objective is to achieve similar formation transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling) while maintaining the desired formation shape. The desired formation shape is determined by a set of similarity constraints on the signed angle and the distance ratio of a pair of edges joining a common vertex. Instead of the error variables with respect to the angle or distance ratio usually used in traditional similarity-rigidity control methods, the relative position errors are obtained by the constant rigidity matrix. Once the position of each USV overlaps with the configuration of the target formation, the desired formation maneuver can be achieved. The proposed control strategy can be implemented in a local coordinate system and directed graphs without intervehicle communication. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

The scenario is that sensors transmit innovations to remote estimators, and event-based schedulers are equipped to save energy. Unlike the existing powerful cyber-attacks, the inversion attack is proposed for attackers with very limited capabilities. We demonstrate that a malicious attacker can degrade system performance simply by directly injecting an inverter into the event scheduler without any system knowledge. The stealthiness of the inversion attack is quantified by two types of failure detectors. To mitigate the attack effect, we further construct an alternative estimator as a countermeasure, based on which a defense strategy is designed for systems at risk of inversion attacks.

We start from an analytical model for the trailing upwash behind a fixed-wing uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), and we derive the optimal air speed for trailing UAVs to maximize their travel endurance. Next, we prove that simply flying at the optimal airspeed will never lead to emergent flocking behavior and propose a new decentralized “aneroid” behavior that yields emergent V formations. We encode these behaviors in a constraint-driven control algorithm that minimizes the locomotive power of each UAV. Finally, we prove that UAVs initialized in an approximate V or echelon formation will converge under our proposed control law, and we demonstrate that this emergence occurs in real time in simulation and in physical experiments with a fleet of Crazyflie quadrotors despite the noise and disturbances inherent in physical systems.},

This selection determines total arrival rates in station queues, which are represented by a fluid state; departure rates are modeled under the assumption that clients have a given sojourn time in the system. The resulting differential equation system is analyzed with tools of optimization. We characterize the equilibrium as the solution to a specific convex program, which has connections to optimal transport problems, and also with road traffic theory. In particular, a price of anarchy appears with respect to a social planner&#39;s allocation. From a dynamical perspective, global convergence to equilibrium is established, with tools of Lagrange duality and Lyapunov theory.

However, the existing results are difficult to ensure the positive minimum interevent times (MIETs) while achieving asymptotic convergence performance. Besides, the drawback that the controllers of the spacecraft suffer from chattering may exist, due to the transmitted discontinuous neighbors&#39; states. To overcome the difficulty and drawback, two novel distributed adaptive control strategies are presented under event-triggered communication condition. Specifically, we first consider the attitude synchronization convergence. To estimate the final synchronization value of the attitude while avoiding the undesirable chattering phenomenon of the controllers, a distributed attitude filter with event-triggered state transmission is presented for each spacecraft, which can generate a continuous reference signal for each spacecraft. To ensure the positive MIETs, a novel triggering condition is designed, by resorting to a clock-like variable. Based on the attitude filter and triggering condition, a distributed adaptive attitude synchronization control scheme is presented. Then, we further generalize the design idea to consider the attitude synchronization tracking of a stationary leader, where a distributed event-triggered adaptive attitude tracking control scheme is proposed. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.},

  abstract     = {This work studies a multiagent Markov decision process (MDP) that can undergo agent dropout and the computation of policies for the postdropout system based on control and sampling of the predropout system. The central planner&#39;s objective is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the value of the expected system given a priori knowledge of the agents&#39; dropout probabilities. For MDPs with a certain transition independence and reward separability structure, we assume that removing agents from the system forms a new MDP comprised of the remaining agents with new state and action spaces, transition dynamics that marginalize the removed agents, and rewards that are independent of the removed agents. We first show that under these assumptions, the value of the expected postdropout system can be represented by a single MDP; this “robust MDP” eliminates the need to evaluate all $2^{N}$ realizations of the system, where $N$ denotes the number of agents. More significantly, in a model-free context, it is shown that the robust MDP value can be estimated with samples generated by the predropout system, meaning that robust policies can be found before dropout occurs. This fact is used to propose a policy importance sampling (IS) routine that performs policy evaluation for dropout scenarios while controlling the existing system with good predropout policies. The policy IS routine produces value estimates for both the robust MDP and specific postdropout system realizations and is justified with exponential confidence bounds. Finally, the utility of this approach is verified in simulation, showing how structural properties of agent dropout can help a controller find good postdropout policies before dropout occurs.},

  abstract     = {The privacy preservation problem in distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking for noncooperative games is studied in this article. Different from adding random noises to the transmitted data in estimators for some global information, a dynamical privacy preservation method is used to both protect each agent&#39;s strategy and avoid reconstructing the privacy of agents. Thus, a novel distributed algorithm is proposed with the masked interactive information to seek NE. Moreover, a discrete-time communication scheme is designed based on an event-triggering rule without the Zeno behavior for the multiagent noncooperative game. The accurate convergence of the designed distributed algorithm is established, rather than the bounded convergence of the differential privacy-based algorithms. The performance of the designed algorithm with communication delay is also analyzed. Cournot competition with distributed energy resources is taken as an example to verify the proposed algorithm.},

One of the main challenges in solving this problem is removing the restrictions imposed on the exosystem matrix while avoiding using global information. To address this challenge, a distributed event-triggered observer is proposed for each agent to estimate the upper bound of the norm of the exosystem matrix, based on which all agents can obtain the same upper bound in finite time. In particular, two types of distributed event-triggered observers are designed to estimate the exosystem matrix and the exosystem state. Meanwhile, with a clock-like variable being incorporated into the event-triggered mechanism, the existence of a positive minimum interevent time can be guaranteed for each agent. Furthermore, external disturbances with known dynamics can be compensated effectively by the proposed adaptive controllers. A numerical example is finally given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control technique.},

The second algorithm operates over heterogeneous networks, i.e., nodes have varying processing delays and communicate in an asynchronous fashion. Our algorithms exhibit efficient communication, finite-time convergence, and operation termination after convergence, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments. We also present topological conditions under which our algorithms enable privacy preservation.

We then formulate optimization problems for unweighted complete graphs and transcribe it to the well-known maximum $k$-cut problem. To reduce the computational complexity, we identify a special solution structure of the optimization problem, and we develop an efficient heuristic descent-based algorithm by taking advantage of this special property of the optimal solution.

And, to guarantee the flexibility of the controller, the sampling fluctuation is taken into account in the design procedure. Then, on the basis of free-matrix-based inequalities, several sufficient consensus criteria with less conservativeness are obtained, which are presented as linear matrix inequalities.

In contrast to previous studies, our primary focus lies in addressing the following question: When we lack prior knowledge about disturbances, what synchronization performance can we achieve compared to a hindsight-based approach? To tackle this challenge, we introduce the concept of regret as a metric to model and quantify our problem, independent of any assumptions regarding disturbances. We define regret as the measure of deviation from an ideal synchronization outcome. Furthermore, we prove that the problem inherently possesses a lower bound of regret, which remains unaffected by disturbances. By appropriately setting the regret requirement, we can transform the problem into an $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ optimal control problem equivalently, which allows us to determine the corresponding synchronization strategy.

A problem with a moderate size may entail forming and then solving a few hundreds of such linear equations. Thus, the computational cost of solving such a problem can be formidable.

As a result, not only the computational cost of the problem is drastically reduced but also the solvability conditions for these equations are significantly weakened.

Despite the importance, research on privacy-preserving DER control in a fully scalable manner is still lacking. To fill this gap, a hierarchical DER aggregation and control framework is first developed to achieve scalability over a large DER population size. Second, a novel privacy-preserving optimization algorithm is proposed for the developed DER aggregation and control framework based on the secret sharing technique. Finally, privacy preservation guarantees of the developed algorithm are provided against honest-but-curious adversaries and external eavesdroppers.

Defense resources against the adversary are allocated by a defender on several selected vertices. First, the objectives of the adversary and the defender with uncertain targets are formulated in a probabilistic manner, resulting in an expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks. Next, we provide a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition under which the cost for the defender and the expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks are bounded. This condition enables the defender to restrict the admissible actions to dominating sets of the graph representing the network. Then, the security allocation problem is solved through a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework.

Each agent in the network possesses a private local convex function consisting of a differentiable term, a nonsmooth term, and a nonsmooth term combined with a linear operator. The objective is to minimize the sum of all local functions while achieving consensus among the local states through information exchange with neighboring agents. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel distributed proximal alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). By introducing the proximal operator of the nonsmooth term, linearizing the smooth term, and incorporating an additional proximal term, the ADMM subproblem can be solved more efficiently. One key advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it allows each agent to select parameters without being constrained by the network topology. In some instances, the algorithm can be transformed into some classical optimization algorithms. The algorithm is further extended to an asynchronous version by introducing randomized block coordinate. We further analyze the convergence of the proposed asynchronous algorithm and establish the sublinear convergence rate under synchronous conditions. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the author studies resilient strong structural controllability (SSC) in networks with misbehaving agents and edges. The author considers various misbehavior models and identifies the set of input agents offering resilience against such disruptions. The author&#39;s approach leverages a graph-based characterization of SSC, utilizing the concept of zero forcing in graphs. Specifically, the author examines three misbehavior models that disrupt the zero forcing process and compromise network SSC. The author then characterizes a leader set that guarantees SSC despite misbehaving nodes and edges, utilizing the concept of leaky forcing—a variation of zero forcing in graphs. The author&#39;s main finding reveals that resilience against one misbehavior model inherently provides resilience against others, thus simplifying the design process. Furthermore, the author explores combining multiple networks by augmenting edges between their nodes to achieve SSC in the combined network using a reduced leader set compared to the leader sets of individual networks. The author analyzes the tradeoff between added edges and leader set size in the resulting combined graph. Finally, the author discusses computational aspects and provides numerical evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the author&#39;s approach.},

We analyze the transient and asymptotic behavior of the infection dynamics in each node of the network. In contrast to the classical scalar epidemic SIR model, where the infection curve is known to be unimodal (either always decreasing over time, or initially increasing until reaching a peak and from then on monotonically decreasing and asymptotically vanishing), we show the possible occurrence of multimodal infection curves in the network SIR epidemic model with $n\geq 2$ subpopulations. We then focus on the special case of rank-1 interaction matrices, modeling subpopulations of homogeneously mixing individuals with different activity rates, susceptibility to the disease, and infectivity levels. For this special case, we find $n$ invariants of motion and provide an explicit expression for the limit equilibrium point. We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the equilibrium points. We then establish an upper bound on the number of changes of monotonicity of the infection curve at the single node level and provide sufficient conditions for its multimodality. Finally, we present some numerical results revealing that in the case of interaction matrices with rank larger than 1, the single nodes&#39; infection curves may display multiple peaks.},

We initially introduce the hidden Markov model (HMM), which accommodates incomplete transition descriptions found in both the transition probability matrix and the observation probability matrix of the observation signal. Importantly, the underlying HMM demonstrates applicability to a broader range of scenarios than certain existing works. Furthermore, data are vulnerable to cyberattacks before being transmitted to the controller due to the open communication architecture, in which adversaries are assumed to inject false data that are capable of affecting data security. To effectively mitigate unnecessary utilization, we develop a novel dynamic event-based protocol involving dynamic threshold parameter and system modes in the feedback channel. Our methodology tackles the vulnerability of data to cyberattacks in open communication architectures, and the proposed protocol provides a feasible security solution for the hidden Markov jump systems. Eventually, the theoretical findings are demonstrated by two provided simulation examples.},

For nondivergent systems over an infinite horizon, the optimal constant and alternating attacks are derived analytically for any system configuration. Characteristics of a novel low-dimensional sinusoidal class of attacks are investigated and procedures for optimization are given.

  abstract     = {It is still an open problem to output feedback stabilization with input quantizations and deception attacks for nonlinear cyber-physical systems subject to mismatched parametric uncertainties via backstepping design. This is because: first, the system contains mismatched uncertainties; second the output is corrupted by an additional attack signal, making the conventional recursive control design strategy using traditional error surfaces unsuitable; and third, since only the compromised output signal is available, the impacts of nonlinear items related to unknown attack weights become difficult to be explicitly addressed in the existing available output feedback control results. In this article, we present a solution to circumvent these obstacles by constructing a set of new $K$-filters using compromised output only, which, together with a coordinate transformation involving the attacked output and filter variables, allow a new form of state-observer-based resilient adaptive control scheme to be developed. Meanwhile, a novel compensation term is incorporated into the real controller to eliminate the effect of quantization on the system stability. It is shown that, by establishing Lyapunov functions appropriately, the original output of the system converges to zero, and all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded. A practice example is provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

The inclusion of control variation in the cost function presents significant challenges in both the design of the corresponding distributed optimal control and the convergence analysis of the resulting closed-loop system. By properly designing the network cost, it is shown that the optimal control law always exists, and the explicit expression of the optimal control gain is given.

Using disturbance observer, event-triggered containment control under DoS attacks and disturbance is guaranteed. It is assumed that separate attacks occurred on the control channels and the communication channels. Moreover, when effective DoS attacks occur, it becomes impossible to communicate data through a communication network, and if the DoS attack is ineffective, the topology graph has a united directed spanning tree. Our method does not require the continuous sharing of state information between neighboring agents; rather, at event times, information is sent to reduce the consumption of communication resources. Using state estimators, trigger times are determined according to the estimator&#39;s data without any continuous information of the neighbor&#39;s state. Using accurate analysis of the time and frequency of DoS attacks, the resilient conditions are obtained, and then, exponential stability of containment behavior under asynchronous attacks is proved by Lyapunov analysis. Moreover, the obtained strictly positive minimal interevent time for agents prevents Zeno behavior. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is shown by simulation.},

The reference generator is based on the estimation of the left eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix and is suitable for unbalanced digraphs. Moreover, the backstepping design technique is efficiently combined with the distributed optimization scheme, leading to a systematic solution for the high-order nonlinear MAS. It is proven that all the outputs of the MAS exponentially converge to the optimal solution of the resource allocation problem under the proposed control. Compared with the existing optimal resource allocation strategies for MASs, the proposed control strategy is applicable to high-order nonlinear MASs and shows favorable exponential convergence, even for unbalanced digraphs.

  abstract     = {This article deals with the formation control of multiagent systems (MASs) subject to disturbances and input constraints, and an active disturbance rejection formation control (ADRFC) approach based on distributed observation is proposed. First, the states and disturbances of tracking error systems are estimated by a distributed intermediate estimator (DIE). Second, an improved distributed model-predictive control (IDMPC) is proposed to achieve the formation control of MASs under disturbances and input constraints. Then, the robust ADRFC method is designed by combining the DIE and IDMPC, and the stability of the whole system is analyzed. Finally, experiments are conducted on an MAS consisting of four mobile robots to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the output regulation problem (ORP) of Boolean control networks (BCNs) is studied via the semitensor product of matrices, with consideration of probabilistic outputs from the reference Boolean networks (BNs). We first define the concept of mean square error (MSE) between outputs of two BNs, establishing several theoretical results on the solvability of the ORP. Subsequently, state feedback controllers are designed to address the ORP of BCNs under different scenarios. In the first scenario, ORP is addressed by developing control strategies that ensure the system&#39;s output remains within a predefined MSE threshold. In the second scenario, we focus on achieving the minimum MSE through the optimization of control strategies. The final scenario extends the second by conducting a detailed analysis to maintain this minimum MSE uniformly across all state pairs. To conclude, several numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel framework for characterizing the dissipativity of uncertain systems whose dynamics evolve according to differential–algebraic equations. Sufficient conditions for dissipativity (specializing to, e.g., stability or $L_{2}$ gain bounds) are provided in the case that uncertainties are characterized by integral quadratic constraints. For polynomial or linear dynamics, these conditions can be efficiently verified through sum-of-squares or semidefinite programming. The performance analysis of the IEEE 39-bus power network with a set of potential line failures modeled as an uncertainty set provides an illustrative example that highlights the computational tractability of this approach; conservatism introduced in this example is shown to be quite minimal.},

  abstract     = {We propose a continuous-time nonlinear model of opinion dynamics with utility-maximizing agents connected via a social influence network. A distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the inclusion of an opinion-dependent resource-penalty term in the utilities, which limits the agents from holding opinions of large magnitude. This model is applicable in scenarios where the opinions pertain to the usage of resources, such as money, time, computational resources, etc. Each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility by revising its opinion in the gradient ascent direction of its utility function, thus leading to the proposed opinion dynamics. We show that for any arbitrary social influence network, opinions are ultimately bounded. For networks with weak antagonistic relations, we show that there exists a globally exponentially stable equilibrium using contraction theory. We establish conditions for the existence of consensus equilibrium and analyze the relative dominance of the agents at consensus. We also conduct a game-theoretic analysis of the underlying opinion formation game, including on Nash equilibria and on prices of anarchy in terms of satisfaction ratios. In addition, we also investigate the oscillatory behavior of opinions in a two-agent scenario. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.},
