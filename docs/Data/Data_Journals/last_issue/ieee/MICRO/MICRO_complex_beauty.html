However, implementing such a solution on a large scale and maintaining it over time is a big challenge. This is due to the need to not only update the device firmware to remove errors and extend the functionality of the devices but also to update the ML models. This imposes several requirements for device monitoring and management mechanisms. In this article, we discuss not only the required aspects that an IoT system should meet, but we also show how they fit into the ML model management process.},

However, the demand for machine learning model updates on embedded systems has become relevant in multiple scenarios. This article proposes a methodology for tiny machine learning operations within the context of the Internet of Intelligent Vehicles, utilizing affordable microcontrollers based on the ESP32 platform. The solution presented in the article consists of two ESP32 devices: one functioning as a radio station (RS) and the other as the microcontroller of an onboard diagnostic (OBD-II) scanner. The RS hosts the updated model and transmits it to the OBD-II scanner using the Espressif Systems Peer-to-Peer Over Wi-Fi communication protocol over 802.11 Wi-Fi. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in model performance postupdate, but the article also identifies critical challenges to model robustness because of the use of the interpreter method on microcontrollers.},

The chiplet market is projected to significantly ramp up in the next few years, and we need to be able to support chiplets from multiple vendors in the same package. These realities create new test and debug challenges through all stages of chiplet productization from sort to in field. There is a scaling challenge to test and debug efficiently without growing package pin count; there is a challenge of test time reduction and interoperability when testing and debugging with chiplets from multiple vendors. Additionally, silicon lifecycle management (SLM) of chiplets in a system in package (SIP) for manufacturing quality monitoring and in-field predictive analysis is a significant challenge. This article presents a comprehensive test, debug, and SLM architecture for addressing these challenges in a Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express-based SIP, paving the way for an open chiplet ecosystem.},

Central to a successful chiplet-based product is the die-to-die interconnect technology between the chiplets. Based on product requirements, some chiplet designs can utilize a single interconnect technology such as 2-D signals over an organic substrate or higher-density 2.5-D integration technologies. With increasing demands on compute and memory capabilities, high-performance products are now moving to heterogeneous integration, which combines multiple advanced packaging technologies all within a single system on chip. To address the market demands for high-performance artificial intelligence solutions, AMD has introduced the AMD Instinct MI300X accelerator.

  abstract     = {Today, packaging plays a crucial role in determining chip performance in systems. As transistor sizes shrink and chip sizes grow to meet increasing processing demands, wafer yield drops. Connecting smaller chips within a package or using multidie designs has gained attention as it improves yield, enables intellectual property reuse, enhances performance, and lowers costs. The Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express standard, developed by industry leaders, supports these efforts by enabling different dies, or chiplets, to work together smoothly. Various structures based on this standard, such as standard 2-D organic substrate, 2.5-D through-silicon via interposer, Fanout redistribution layer organic interposer, and 3-D hybrid bonding, have been suggested. Despite the benefits, die integration faces challenges due to dense and intricate connections. This article focuses on achieving effective die-to-die connectivity using organic and advanced packaging. These patterns have been validated through simulations and the fabrication of the test chip.},

The rise in cost per transistor (CPT) is outweighing scaling benefits from advances in generational process technology. These diminishing silicon economies of scale have pushed foundries, EDA companies, and the manufacturing ecosystem to enable chiplet designs. Developments in packaging technology and standardization of die-to-die interfaces provide technology gains offsetting challenges of die sizes and CPT. Standards bodies and IP implementers have risen to the challenge, providing solutions to interface bottlenecks. We examine standards for chiplet and die-to-die interfaces, such as UCIe and the work done in the industry to enable these. Architectural partitions for chiplet implementations and development of reusable components that enable a future chiplet marketplace are considered. The juggernaut for differentiation and disaggregation in the more-than-Moore era continues to build momentum. We examine these trends and recent technology advances, looking at future directions for implementations.},
