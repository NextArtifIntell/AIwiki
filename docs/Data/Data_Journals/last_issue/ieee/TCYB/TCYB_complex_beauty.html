  abstract     = {Muscle force and morphology information offer complementary perspectives for gesture recognition and its applications. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) provides force and electrophysiological information associated with muscles, while A-mode ultrasound (AUS) reveals muscle morphological information. By leveraging these two modalities, more comprehensive muscle motor unit information relevant to gesture recognition can be obtained. In this article, we introduce the adaptive weight classification (AWC) module and its enhanced version with hierarchical classifiers, adaptive weight hierarchical soft voting (AWHSV), to integrate AUS and sEMG into a fused modality. This approach dynamically adjusts the weights of individual and fused features, compensating for lost details during fusion, leading to a richer information representation and significantly improving algorithm robustness in gesture recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves recognition rates that are 0.66%, 2.36%, and 1.30% higher than those of its counterparts using sEMG, AUS, and sEMG-AUS, respectively. Moreover, the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, confirming its effectiveness in gesture recognition across both single and multiple modalities. This work demonstrates the advantages of the proposed AWHSV method, providing broader application scenarios for gesture recognition.},

  abstract     = {A dynamic event-triggered load frequency control (LFC) is studied for interconnected multiarea power systems (IMAPSs) with stochastic semi-Markov parameters from the perspective of finite-time interval. To facilitate the sudden changes, the underlying semi-Markov process (SMP) is adopted to characterize the random behavior of IMAPSs. A dynamic event-triggered protocol (DETP) is developed to modulate the transmission frequency while maintaining predefined system performance. Owing to complicated grid environment, the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is proposed to solve the asynchronization between the system mode and the controller mode, which forms a new asynchronous mechanism to better understand the behavior pattern of the system. The novelty of this article is to construct a suitable asynchronous control strategy to solve the mismatch between the system mode and the controller mode under the framework of IMAPSs. Different from static event-triggered protocol (ETP), the DETP is proposed, in which the threshold parameters can be dynamically adjusted to reduce the waste of communication resources and achieve dynamic performance in limited time. According to the stochastic system theory and the finite-time theory, by constructing a modular dependent random Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the finite-time boundedness of the corresponding system with $H_{\infty }$ performance. Finally, the efficiency is demonstrated through three-area power systems.},

Taking into account the disturbance as control inputs, the optimal control problem for the nonlinear MASs is reformulated as a multiplayer zero-sum differential game. In addition, a single network ADP structure is constructed to approach the optimal consensus control policies. Subsequently, an event triggering mechanism is implemented to reduce the workload of the controller and conserve computing and communication resources. Since then, in order to further streamline the intricacies of controller design, this work is extended to self-triggered cases to alleviate the need for hardware devices to continuously monitor signals. By using the Lyapunov method, the stability of the nonlinear MASs and the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the weight estimation error of the critic neural network (NN) is proved.

  abstract     = {To alleviate data distribution under different operating conditions, domain generalization (DG) has been applied in mechanical diagnosis. Still, its effectiveness is limited when unknown fault states appear in the target domain. Consequently, open set DG (OSDG) has emerged to identify unknown classes in unknown domains. However, data collection costs and safety concerns have resulted in a significant class imbalance in OSDG. This imbalance causes the decision boundary to be skewed toward abundant positive classes, ultimately leading to misclassifying unknown states and increasing security risks. Currently, there is a lack of methods to simultaneously address domain shift and class shift in an imbalanced unknown domain. To tackle this issue, this article proposes a multisource domain-class gradient coordination meta-learning (MDGCML) framework, which can learn the generalized boundaries of all tasks by coordinating gradients between interdomains and interclasses. Based on the MDGCML, a joint learning paradigm involving the sharing of parameters between open-set classifiers and closed-set classifiers is constructed to enable quick adaption of the model to unknown domains. The superior performance of the proposed framework has been verified on two datasets.},

Scholars have proposed various effective constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) for such problems. However, most existing algorithms overlook the differences between different decision variables in influencing the degree of constraint violation and still lack an effective handling mechanism for constraint-sensitive variables. To address this issue, a two-stage cooperation multiobjective evolutionary algorithm guided by constraint-sensitive variables (CV-TCMOEA) is proposed. In the first stage, a relatively simple auxiliary problem with only a few dominant constraints is constructed to approximate the original problem. After obtaining a set of approximate Pareto optimal solutions by dealing with the auxiliary problem, in the second stage, a constraint-sensitive variable-guided multistrategy cooperation search method is developed. In this method, decision variables are divided into two types: 1) constraint-sensitive and 2) constraint-insensitive variables, and a variable-type-guided cooperative individual update strategy is proposed to autonomously select appropriate search strategies for different types of variables. Experimental results on 28 benchmark functions and 10 engineering problems demonstrated the superiority of the CV-TCMOEA over seven state-of-the-art CMOEAs.},

  abstract     = {Subspace clustering has attracted significant interest for its capacity to partition high-dimensional data into multiple subspaces. The current approaches to subspace clustering predominantly revolve around two key aspects: 1) the construction of an effective similarity matrix and 2) the pursuit of sparsity within the projection matrix. However, assessing whether the dimensionality of the projected subspace is the true dimensionality of the data is challenging. Therefore, the clustering performance may decrease when dealing with scenarios such as subspace overlap, insufficient projected dimensions, data noise, etc., since the defined dimensionality of the projected lower-dimensional space may deviate significantly from its true value. In this research, we introduce a novel reweighting strategy, which is applied to projected coordinates for the first time and propose a reweighted subspace clustering model guided by the preservation of the both local and global structural characteristics (RWSC). The projected subspaces are reweighted to augment or suppress the importance of different coordinates, so that data with overlapping subspaces can be better distinguished and the redundant coordinates produced by the predefined number of projected dimensions can be further removed. By introducing reweighting strategies, the bias caused by imprecise dimensionalities in subspace clustering can be alleviated. Moreover, global scatter structure preservation and adaptive local structure learning are integrated into the proposed model, which helps RWSC capture more intrinsic structures and its robustness and applicability can then be improved. Through rigorous experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, the effectiveness and superiority of RWSC are empirically verified.},

  abstract     = {In data stream (DS) learning, the system has to extract knowledge from data generated continuously, usually at high speed and in large volumes, making it impossible to store the entire set of data to be processed in batch mode. Hence, machine learning models must be built incrementally by processing the incoming examples, as data arrive, while updating the model to be compatible with the current data. In fuzzy DS clustering, the model can either absorb incoming data into existing clusters or initiate a new cluster. As the volume of data increases, there is a possibility that the clusters will overlap to the point where it is convenient to merge two or more clusters into one. Then, a cluster comparison measure (CM) should be applied, to decide whether such clusters should be combined, also in an incremental manner. This defines an incremental fusion process based on aggregation functions that can aggregate the incoming inputs without storing all the previous inputs. The objective of this article is to solve the fuzzy DS clustering problem of incrementally comparing fuzzy clusters on a formal basis. First, we formalize and operationalize incremental fusion processes of fuzzy clusters by introducing recursively extendable (RE) aggregation functions, studying construction methods and different classes of such functions. Second, we propose two approaches to compare clusters: 1) similarity and 2) overlapping between clusters, based on RE aggregation functions. Finally, we analyze the effect of those incremental CMs on the online and offline phases of the well-known fuzzy clustering algorithm d-FuzzStream, showing that our new approach outperforms the original algorithm and presents better or comparable performance to other state-of-the-art DS clustering algorithms found in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In the field of smart surface mount technology (SMT) production, integrating machines through a cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture holds significant potential for improving assembly quality and efficiency. However, fully unifying inspection and production systems to effectively address assembly-related quality issues remains a challenge. This study seeks to close these gaps by introducing collaborative optimization methods to ensure seamless operations. The research is driven by the need for precise control of key assembly parameters, such as placement height, x-offset, y-offset, rotation angle deviations, and blowing durations, all of which are major contributors to defects. To address these challenges, we propose a self-adaptive collaborative optimization (SACO) framework that prioritizes enhancements based on their impact on both quality and efficiency. The SACO framework combines customized Bayesian optimization and particle swarm optimization techniques, allowing for dynamic adjustments to process parameters, guided by real-time data from automatic optical inspection (AOI) systems. The primary goal of this study is to reduce defects and improve efficiency in the SMT assembly process through these targeted improvements. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating significant advancements in placement accuracy and overall assembly efficiency. Our findings confirm that the SACO framework provides a robust solution to persistent challenges in SMT production, addressing critical gaps in quality control and process optimization.},

Additionally, fractional differential calculus is based on differentiation and integration of arbitrary fractional order, which can more accurately describe the physical phenomenon model than the traditional integer calculus. Thus, this article proposes a novel fractional-order extended Kalman filter (FOEKF) based on the evolutionary algorithm and deep ensemble learning techniques for the state estimation problem of CPPSs from the fractional-order theory perspective. First, the power system is modeled as a fractional version to describe the physical phenomenon better according to the fractional differential calculus theory. Then, considering the difficulties in determining fractional orders in the fractional-order power system, a deep ensemble learning-based approach is used to design the fitness function and a genetic algorithm is developed to determine these parameters by optimizing the designed objective function. Furthermore, to solve the difficulties in estimating for fractional-order power system by integral extended Kalman filter (EKF), the evolutionary FOEKF (EFOEKF) is presented as the estimator for the designed fractional-order power system. Finally, to improve the performance of EFOEKF under bad datum scenarios caused by cyber-attacks or sudden loads, an enhanced EFOEKF method is developed by using an adapted exponential weighting function. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed EFOEKF is better than EKF and FOEKF on four different IEEE bus systems in terms of the mean absolute error.},

By means of the compressed sensing (CS) theory and a diffusion strategy, we propose a compressed distributed Kalman filter (CDKF). That is, each sensor first compresses the original high-dimensional regression data. Then, the covariance intersection fusion rule is utilized to obtain a distributed Kalman filter (DKF) estimate in the compressed low-dimensional space. Afterward, the original high-dimensional sparse state vector can be well recovered by a reconstruction technique. In terms of stability analysis, one of the main difficulties lies in analyzing the product of nonindependent and nonstationary random matrices in the context of time-varying communication topologies. Relying on the stochastic stability theory, the Markov chain theory, and the CS theory, we establish the upper bound for the estimation error under the compressed cooperative excitation condition, which is much weaker than the traditional uncompressed collective observability conditions used in the existing literature. Finally, we provide a simulation example to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

These two adaptive quantization mechanisms ensure convergence of the system output toward the desired reference without saturating the quantizer under any initial input.

  abstract     = {In this article, a policy-iteration-based active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is proposed for uncertain nonlinear systems to achieve real-time output tracking performance, regardless of the specific relative degree of the system. The approach integrates a partial control input generator with a policy-iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent for degree weight adjustment. The partial control input generator includes each ith order partial control input, which is constructed following the ADRC design framework for an ith order system. The RL agent adjusts the degree weights (its actions) to enhance the dominance of the partial control input corresponding to the unknown relative degree through iterative policy refinement. The RL agent is designed to minimize the quadratic reward as the performance index function while enhancing the influence of the partial control input associated with the correct relative degree via the policy iteration procedure. All signals in the closed-loop system (including the time-varying degree weights) ensure semi-global uniformly ultimately boundness using the Lyapunov stability theorem and the affinely quadratically stable property. Consequently, the degree weight adjustments by the RL agent do not affect the closed-loop stability. The proposed method does not require system dynamics, specific relative degree, external disturbances, and other state variable sensing beyond output sensing. The performance of the proposed method was validated via simulations for two different-order uncertain nonlinear systems and experiments using a permanent magnet synchronous motor testbed.},

  abstract     = {The coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) within virtual power plants (VPPs) is expected to generate significant economic benefits and enhance the operational stability of modern power systems. However, achieving massive coordination of heterogeneous and uncertain DERs remains a challenge in current research. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel bi-level optimization approach based on mean-field reinforcement learning (MFRL) to enable the coordination of massive DERs in VPPs. The problem is decomposed into multiple subproblems: the upper-level subproblem models power dispatch among integrated energy systems (IESs) in response to coordinated demand, while a series of lower-level subproblems determine the operational schemes of DERs within individual IESs. Considering the large decision space, an MFRL algorithm with fast Shapley credit allocation is developed to efficiently solve the upper-level optimization. Meanwhile, the lower-level subproblems are formulated as small-scale mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems, addressing the difficulties caused by IES heterogeneity in applying mean-field approximation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves convergence speed and reduces the global cost of VPP operation, especially in massive-scale scenarios. In test scenarios ranging from 10 to 500 agents, the proposed bi-level optimization approach improves the objective by 4.8%–26.6%, compared to the advanced baseline method.},

The introduction of a communication infrastructure inevitably brings communication threats, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and network induced delays. This article represents the first attempt toward a unified distributed digital predictor-based control scheme for the solution of the secondary voltage restoration problem in islanded MGs, which also involves external unknown disturbances and network vulnerabilities, thus enhancing its resilience and reliability. The novel sampled-data predictive controller revises the conventional model reduction approach to reformulate it in a fully distributed digital way and involves some external disturbances information for prediction performance improvement, even though these perturbations are completely unknown. The main features of the resulting method are: 1) large delays compensation accounting for networked-induced delays and sleeping time interval due to DoS attacks occurrence and 2) unknown disturbance attenuation, usually neglected in the controllers synthesis phase in MGs field. Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory is exploited to analytically prove the exponential stability of the MG voltage, thus leading to linear matrix inequality-based sufficient stability conditions. Numerical and experimental results confirm theoretical derivations.},

  abstract     = {Owing to advancements in deep learning technology, vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various computer vision tasks. Nonetheless, ViTs still face some challenges, such as high computational complexity and the absence of desirable inductive biases. To alleviate these issues, the potential advantages of combining eagle vision with ViTs are explored. A bi-fovea visual interaction (BFVI) structure inspired by the unique physiological and visual characteristics of eagle eyes is introduced. Based on this structural design approach, a novel bi-fovea self-attention (BFSA) mechanism and bi-fovea feedforward network (BFFN) are proposed. These components are employed to mimic the hierarchical and parallel information processing scheme of the biological visual cortex, thereby enabling networks to learn the feature representations of the targets in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, a bionic eagle vision (BEV) block is designed as the basic building unit based on the BFSA mechanism and the BFFN. By stacking the BEV blocks, a unified and efficient family of pyramid backbone networks called eagle ViTs (EViTs) is developed. Experimental results indicate that the EViTs exhibit highly competitive performance in various computer vision tasks, demonstrating their potential as backbone networks. In terms of computational efficiency and scalability, EViTs show significant advantages compared with other counterparts. The developed code is available at https://github.com/nkusyl/EViT.},

  abstract     = {Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms extract task information from experienced context in order to reason about new tasks, and facilitate rapid adaptation. The quality of these contextual representations (or embeddings) is therefore crucial for a meta-RL agent to make effective decisions in unknown environments. Current methods predominantly assume the existence of a single underlying task, but using a single contextual embedding may not be expressive enough to fully capture the broader distribution of task variations that an agent might encounter. Decomposing that information into different representations can allow them to capture more relevant features in context space while applying additional structure that aids downstream exploitation. In this article, we develop global-local embeddings for contextual meta-RL (GLOBEX), an off-policy contextual meta-RL algorithm that decomposes the contextual representation into separate global and local embeddings. The learning process maximizes information retained by the embeddings and utilizes a mutual information constraint to encourage decoupling. Illustrative examples show that our method effectively adapts by identifying global task dynamics and exploiting temporally local signals. In addition, GLOBEX outperforms existing state-of-the-art meta-RL algorithms on standard MuJoCo benchmarks.},

However, their performances are limited given complicated environments, especially when the speed of quadrupedal robots is relatively high. In this work, a newly designed VOT algorithm for a quadrupedal robot based on a Siamese network is introduced. First, a one-stage detector for locating moving objects is designed and applied. Then, position information of moving objects is fed into a newly designed Siamese adaptive network to estimate their scale and aspect ratio. For regressing bounding boxes of a target object, a box adaptive head with an asymmetric convolution (ACM) layer is newly proposed.

Furthermore, we reformulate the problem for enhanced index tracking by adding constraints based on a second-order stochastic domination rule. To overcome the nonconvexity of the objective function in the formulated problems, we propose a sparse Bayesian regression algorithm based on multiple recurrent neural networks in the collaborative neurodynamic optimization framework.

To overcome these challenges, an efficacious search method is usually needed to improve the efficiency of searching optimal solution and utilization of data structure used to store nondominated vectors. The originality of this work comes with a creative and novel design of Kriging surrogate model-based simplex crossover operator (KSCO) and Kriging surrogate model-based local search of simplex crossover operator (KLSSCO). KSCO is used to calculate the speed update equation, as well as the coefficients of the equation.

  abstract     = {The goal of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is to learn new concepts from a limited number of novel samples while preserving the knowledge of previously learned classes. The mainstream FSCIL framework begins with training in the base session, after which the feature extractor is frozen to accommodate novel classes. We observed that traditional base-session training approaches often lead to overfitting on challenging samples, which can lead to reduced robustness in the decision boundaries and exacerbate the forgetting phenomenon when introducing incremental data. To address this issue, we proposed the progressive learning strategy (PGLS). First, inspired by curriculum learning, we developed a covariance noise perturbation approach based on the statistical information as a difficulty measure for assessing sample robustness. We then reweighted the samples based on their robustness, initially concentrating on enhancing model stability by prioritizing robust samples and subsequently leveraging weakly robust samples to improve generalization. Second, we predefined forward compatibility for various virtual class augmentation models. Within base class training, we employed a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduced fewer to more virtual classes in order to mitigate any adverse effects on model performance. This strategy enhances the adaptability of base classes to novel ones and alleviates forgetting problems. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and miniImageNet datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed method over state-of-the-art models.},

The facilitation of communication between sensors and the remote estimator through wireless networks, which are subject to bit rate constraints, involves the use of a coding-decoding mechanism. For efficient estimation in the presence of periodic measurements, a specialized impulsive estimation method is developed, which aims to carry out impulsive corrections precisely at the instants when the measurement signal is received by the estimator. By employing the iteration analysis method under the impulsive mechanism, a sufficient condition is established that ensures the exponential boundedness of the estimation error dynamics. Furthermore, an optimization algorithm is introduced for addressing the challenges related to bit rate allocation and the design of desired estimator gains. Within the presented theoretical framework, the correlation between estimation performance and bit rate allocation is elucidated. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed estimation approach.},

  abstract     = {The innovation of optimal learning control methods is profoundly propelled due to the improvement of the learning ability. In this article, we investigate the synthesis of initialization and acceleration for optimal learning control algorithms. This approach contrasts with traditional methods that concentrate solely on either the improvement of initialization or acceleration. Specifically, we establish a novel relaxed policy iteration (PI) algorithm with self-learning horizon for stochastic optimal control. Notably, by suitably utilizing self-learning horizon, we can directly evaluate inadmissible policies to reduce the initialization burden. Meanwhile, the inadmissible policy can be rapidly optimized with few learning iterations. Then, several critical conclusions of relaxed optimal control are established by discussing algorithm convergence and system stability. Furthermore, to provide the convincing application potentials, a class of unconventional problems is effectively solved by the relaxed PI algorithm, including the dynamics with external noises and nonzero equilibrium. Finally, we present a series of nonlinear benchmarks with practical applications to comprehensively evaluate the performance of relaxed PI. The experimental results obtained from these diverse benchmarks uniformly highlight the effectiveness of self-learning horizon mechanism.},

First, an input saturation constraint based on the UAV dynamic model is investigated in this article, and an adaptive compensating term is developed to handle the input saturation. The DoS attacks considered in this article can interrupt all the communication transmissions of the attacked UAV from neighbors so that the victim is not able to receive any information from neighboring UAVs during DoS attacks. To deal with such a difficult problem, a fixed-time security constraint estimator (FTSCE) is proposed to ensure the stability and security of UAVs during the DoS attacks. Moreover, the unknown state is estimated to reduce the amount of the transferred information. Based on the proposed FTSCE, the relative position and velocity of UAV states are used to design the resilient consensus controller against the DoS attacks. By using the proposed controller, the system stability can be guaranteed according to the Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the numerical simulation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed resilient consensus control method.},

  abstract     = {This article first presents a dual flexible prescribed performance control (DFPPC) approach of input saturated high-order nonlinear systems (IS-HONSs). Compared to the existing PPC approaches of IS-HONSs, under which the performance constraint boundaries (PCBs) are usually fixed and bounded, resulting in a restriction of the initial error in the algorithm implementation; in addition, the coupling relationship between performance constraints and input saturation is usually ignored, resulting in the methods are very fragile when input saturation occurs. By designing the novel tensile model-based PCBs that depend on output and input constraints, the proposed DFPPC method provides sufficient resilience for both the initial conditions and the input saturation, so that the proposed DFPPC method can not only be suitable for multiple types of initial errors by adjusting the parameters, including $e_{1}(0)\in (\underline {\mathcal {B}}(0),\bar {\mathcal {B}}(0))$ , $e_{1}(0)\in (-\infty,\bar {\mathcal {B}}(0))$ , $e_{1}(0)\in (\underline {\mathcal {B}}(0),+\infty)$ and $e_{1}(0)\in (-\infty,\infty)$ , where $\underline {\mathcal {B}}(0)$ , and $\bar {\mathcal {B}}(0)$ denote the initial PCBs; but also can achieve a good balance between input saturation and performance constraints, i.e., when the control input reaches or exceeds the saturation threshold, the PCBs can adaptively extend to avoid the singularity, and when the control input returns to the saturation threshold range, the PCBs are then adaptively restored to the original PCBs. The results show that the proposed DFPPC algorithm guarantees semi-global boundedness for all closed-loop signals, while ensuring that the system output accurately tracks the desired signal, and it consistently maintains the tracking error within the PCBs. The developed algorithm is illustrated by means of simulation instances.},

  abstract     = {Industrial data often consist of continuous variables (CVs) and binary variables (BVs), both of which provide crucial information about process operating conditions. Due to the coupling between industrial systems or equipment, these hybrid variables are usually high-dimensional and highly correlated. However, existing methods generally model hybrid variables directly in the observation space and assume independence between the variables to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Thus, they are ineffective at capturing dependencies among hybrid variables, and the effectiveness of process monitoring will be compromised. To overcome the limitations, this study proposes to seek a unified subspace for hybrid variables using the probabilistic latent variable (LV) model. By introducing a low-dimensional continuous LV, the proposed method can avoid the curse of dimensionality while capturing the dependencies between hybrid variables. Nevertheless, the inference of LV is analytically intractable and thus time-consuming due to the heterogeneity of CVs and BVs. To accelerate offline learning and online inference procedures, this study originally derives an analytical Gaussian distribution to approximate the true posterior distribution of the LV, based on which an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm is developed for parameter estimation. The Gaussian approximation is simultaneously optimized with the latest parameters to achieve a high approximation accuracy. The LV is then estimated by the posterior mean of the Gaussian approximation. By mapping the heterogeneous variables into a unified subspace, the proposed method defines three monitoring statistics, which are physically interpretable and thoroughly evaluate the probability of hybrid variables being normal. The effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting anomalies in CVs and BVs is shown through a numerically simulated case and a real industrial case.},

  abstract     = {Neuroimaging analysis aims to reveal the information-processing mechanisms of the human brain in a noninvasive manner. In the past, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in capturing the non-Euclidean structure of brain networks. However, existing neuroimaging studies focused primarily on spatial functional connectivity, despite temporal dynamics in complex brain networks. To address this gap, we propose a spatio-temporal interactive graph representation framework (STIGR) for dynamic neuroimaging analysis that encompasses different aspects from classification and regression tasks to interpretation tasks. STIGR leverages a dynamic adaptive-neighbor graph convolution network to capture the interrelationships between spatial and temporal dynamics. To address the limited global scope in graph convolutions, a self-attention module based on Transformers is introduced to extract long-term dependencies. Contrastive learning is used to adaptively contrast similarities between adjacent scanning windows, modeling cross-temporal correlations in dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments on six public neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of STIGR across different platforms, achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and regression tasks. The proposed framework enables the detection of remarkable temporal association patterns between regions of interest based on sequential neuroimaging signals, offering medical professionals a versatile and interpretable tool for exploring task-specific neurological patterns.

  abstract     = {Process variables may exhibit both temporal trends and periodic responses, with their fault propagation pathways manifesting in time-domain and frequency-domain causalities, respectively. However, the differing causal perspectives of time-domain and frequency-domain methods can lead to distinct causalities, posing the causal heterogeneity challenge for root cause diagnosis (RCD). Thereupon, we reveal the mechanism of source consistency in Granger causality (GC), that is, the root cause variable provides the most significant predictive information in both time and frequency domains. Accordingly, we propose a causal source consistency analytics (CSCA) framework that achieves time-frequency synergy. First, we design a nonlinear enhancement module to extract temporal features for causal inference. Second, to extract time-domain and frequency-domain GC, we develop a parallel causality learning module, where a differentiable frequency-domain expansion operator is designed along with a temporal prediction submodule. Meanwhile, a time-frequency entropy constraint is constructed to ensure causal significance by inducing sparsity. Finally, a root cause alignment module is proposed to ensure source consistency. A predictive information quantification algorithm, formulated as an eigenvalue decomposition problem, is designed to locate the root cause. We develop an approximate exponential transformation to convert the eigenvalue decomposition into a differentiable source alignment loss. Thus, source consistency can be ensured during end-to-end inference. The validity of CSCA is illustrated through the Tennessee Eastman process and a gas turbine application. CSCA identified the root causes in both examples correctly. Furthermore, ablation studies validate that CSCA enables the time-domain and frequency-domain models to identify consistent root causes, thereby overcoming causal heterogeneity.},

The considered system features unknown time-varying parameters, mismatched uncertainties, and uncertain functions that satisfy nonlinear growth conditions. These complexities render the standard backstepping recursive design scheme inapplicable, as the derivative of the virtual controller does not exist. To address the intermittent output feedback problem, we introduce a novel dynamic backstepping control method. First, we establish a dynamic gain observer using the triggered output signals to reconstruct the unmeasurable state variables. Next, the concept of dynamic gain is introduced through a coordinate transformation, with its derivative employed to offset discontinuous terms, which solves the challenges in recursive backstepping design caused by intermittent output and regulates that the state variable converges asymptotically to the origin in the global sense.

Specifically, a distributed prescribed-time observer is constructed for each agent using event-based communications to estimate the states of the exosystem. The constructed observer operates without requiring prior knowledge of the exosystem dynamics or global information, ensuring that observation errors converge to a small neighborhood around zero within a user-determined time interval. Additionally, the incorporation of the DETM guarantees a positive lower bound on the interexecution intervals, thereby alleviating the communication demands. Building on this observer, neuro-adaptive prescribed-time controllers are derived for each agent, capable of maintaining the system states within a user-defined compact set without the need for prior knowledge of the initial system states. It is demonstrated that the regulated outputs converge to a region arbitrarily tuned by the user within a prescribed time, with all signals remaining bounded and Zeno behavior eliminated.

  abstract     = {Wastewater treatment processes (WWTPs) are operated under multiple operating conditions. Designing an appropriate optimal control strategy based on the identification of operating conditions is crucial for ensuring the safe operation of WWTPs. To effectively deal with the problem of multiple operating conditions in WWTPs, a data-knowledge-driven multiobjective adaptive optimal control (DK-MAOC) strategy is proposed. First, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is employed as the prediction model to obtain the concentrations of nitrate and total nitrogen. Then, the operating conditions of WWTPs can be determined. Second, an adaptive objective function (AOF) is proposed to dynamically adjust the weights of operating indices to meet the operational requirements of each operating condition. In particular, the AOF integrates operating requirements and tracking errors to simultaneously consider the feasibility of the controller when solving setpoints. Third, due to the differences in data distribution under each operating condition, real-time data during condition changing is insufficient to accurately predict. A data-knowledge-driven model, incorporating operational knowledge into the FNN-based predictive model, is established to predict the future dynamics of WWTPs. Finally, a collaborative gradient descent algorithm is proposed to simultaneously solve for setpoints and control laws. The effectiveness of the proposed DK-MAOC is tested on the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1. The experimental results indicate that DK-MAOC can effectively avoid the situation of effluent nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen exceeding the standards while reducing energy consumption of WWTPs. Therefore, the proposed DK-MAOC can guarantee optimal operation of WWTPs.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the secure leader-follower consensus of nonlinear multiagent systems under multimode Denial-of-Service attacks. According to the topology characteristics after attacks, three kinds of different attack modes are introduced. Moreover, the common zero-topology attack is encompassed within the multimode attacks considered in this article. Due to the difficulty of directly obtaining the state of the system in some circumstances, a state observer is designed utilizing localized output information of the MASs to estimate the state. By applying suitable observer-based controller and Lyapunov method, some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the observer-based secure consensus of the MASs under multimode DoS attacks. Furthermore, the obtained results can be extended to linear MASs under DoS attacks. Finally, two practical examples on power system are provided to demonstrate the validity of the derived theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Multistate coupled coupled neural networks (MSCCNN) and multiderivative coupled coupled neural networks (MDCCNN) are introduced in this article, and the lag outer synchronization for these two networks are tackled. First, a lag outer synchronization criterion for MSCCNN is derived using a node-based adaptive event-triggered control scheme, and the fact that the Zeno behavior does not exist is also proved. Moreover, the edge-based adaptive event-triggered control method is also utilized to address the lag outer synchronization for MSCCNN, and the existence of Zeno behavior is ruled out. In addition, two lag outer synchronization criteria for MDCCNN are given on the basis of the node- and edge-based adaptive event-triggered control strategies, and the nonexistence of Zeno behavior is also established. Finally, two examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control schemes.},

  abstract     = {The high level of autonomy within autonomous systems demands new control strategies to achieve more complex objectives while ensuring both safety and robustness, rather than relying solely on a given reference. To this end, this article addresses the problem of temporal logic disturbance rejection control (TLDRC) for a class of nonlinear systems subject to disturbances. Signal temporal logic (STL) specifications are introduced for the representation of complex tasks. A control barrier function (CBF), composed of a monotonic function characterizing the temporal behavior of the system and a predicate function, is constructed to encode the STL specifications. To guarantee robustness against disturbances, generalized proportional integral observers (GPIOs) are introduced for higher-accuracy disturbance estimation. It is shown that by fully exploiting the constructed CBF and the disturbance estimate, the developed TLDRC strategy is able to ensure the STL specifications and compensate undesirable effects caused by unknown disturbances, even if they are fast-time-varying. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {This study seeks to develop a constructive approach that settles the optimal control issue for nonlinear systems with known time delays. The feedback system, which depends on the state and control input, is built to identify the actual control rule utilizing the backstepping integral technique. Optimal control of the augmented system established on parallel control delivers a solution for nonlinear time-delayed systems. At the cost of the modified $L_{2}$ gain condition, the value function is specified in terms of the state and input delays, transforming the optimal control issue into a minimax task. Then, the critic-actor framework is employed to reconstruct the cost function and control rule while maintaining the persistently exciting (PE) condition so that the online optimal control algorithm is investigated. In addition, the Lyapunov proof discusses the system’s stability. Ultimately, the remarkable properties become visible through experimental findings.},
