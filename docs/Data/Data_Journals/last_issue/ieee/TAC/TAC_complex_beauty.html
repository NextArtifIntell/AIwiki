We propose a novel outlier-robust scheme, MCIC-MEKF, utilizing the minimum correntropy-induced cost (MCIC) criterion. We provide a theoretical analysis of its outlier robustness through stochastic stability, proving exponentially bounded mean square posterior estimation error under natural conditions. In addition, we present a technical approximation for the adaptive Kalman gain, enhancing efficiency without compromising performance. Simulation results confirm MCIC-MEKF&#39;s robustness against various non-Gaussian noises with large outliers, outperforming several filtering benchmarks.},

Different from the traditional stochastic systems with continuous or periodic output signals, the system output measurements under consideration are only available at sampling times and they are aperiodic. To deal with this problem, we propose a compensator for the unmeasurable system states and a novel aperiodic event-triggered control (AETC) based on the compensator and output to guarantee a good convergence of the state error. Subsequently, we apply the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method (LKFM) to solve the difficulty induced by the delays involved in both SFDSs and output values. Then, the mean-square exponential stabilization of SFDSs is established by AETC and LKFM. Finally, the obtained results are verified by a two-stage chemical reactor system.},

  abstract     = {This technical note deals with asymptotic stabilization of general nonlinear discrete-time systems by dynamic output feedback control. First, a sufficient condition for the dynamic output feedback stabilization with the closed-loop domain of attraction (DOA) estimation is given. For a given Lyapunov function of the plant state and the controller state, the negative-definite domain (NDD) in the $(z_+$-$u$-$z$-$y)$-space is proposed, where $z_+,u,z$, and $y$ denote the next controller state, the current control input, the current controller state and the current plant output, respectively. All points $(z_+;u;z;y)$ in the NDD can make the time difference of the Lyapunov function negative-definite for the controller state $z$ and all plant states in a set of plant states, which is determined by the controller state $z$ and the plant output $y$. The NDD in the $(z_+$-$u$-$z$-$y)$-space could be viewed as an unstructured dynamic output feedback stabilization controller set. And any invariant subset of the projection of the NDD in the $(z_+$-$u$-$z$-$y)$-space onto the $(z$-$x)$-space is an estimate of the DOA for the closed-loop, where $x$ denotes the current plant state. Second, based on the NDD, the controller design problem is converted to a set approximation problem in Euclidean space. Using numerical set approximation methods, dealing with strong nonlinearities is no longer the bottleneck. An estimation method for the unstructured dynamic output feedback stabilization controller set is proposed based on interval analysis, which is a kind of guaranteed numerical method for approximating sets.},

It employs a dynamics update law and a state synchronizing control law, collectively termed a two-level controller, to facilitate synchronization in heterogeneous MASs autonomously. Nevertheless, the existing theory is constrained by the requirement of network topology information for calculating sufficiently large gains to design both the dynamics update law and the state synchronizing control law. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a novel design for the two-level controller, enabling synchronization without reliance on network topology. The design parameters undergo adaptive updates until achieving autonomous synchronization, herein termed adaptive autonomous synchronization.},

In our method, the generalized blended dynamics is presented to analyze the heterogeneity of systems. By utilizing polynomial Lyapunov functions, the synchronization criterion for HPNSs under directed topology is presented, along with a bounded set where the synchronization errors of HPNSs reside when the time progresses towards infinity. Compared with the existing criteria from quadratic Lyapunov functions, our results yield a smaller bounded set and thus are less conservative. Drawing upon the established criterion, the synchronization verification problem is transformed into a sum-of-squares optimization problem. This consequential optimization problem aligns with the paradigm of convex programming, thereby affording a polynomial-time solvability. The proposed optimization algorithm efficiently generates polynomial Lyapunov functions, facilitating automatic verification of bounded synchronization. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.},

First, a distributed synergistic hybrid controller is synthesized by leveraging a coadjoint incidence matrix to assign to neighboring agents a hybrid feedback that is based on their relative position. It leads to robust and global asymptotic stability in tree networks. Second, the existence of synergistic potential functions (SPFs)—the key ingredient for deriving the hybrid feedback—is established on compact Lie groups. Moreover, a direct extension shows that there exists an SPF on the noncompact special Euclidean group $\text{SE}(n)$. In contrast with some existing results, the proposed controller removes the invariance condition on the hybrid feedback, and the existence of the SPF ensures that our controller is applicable to many Lie groups of practical interests. Finally, a worked example of multiple planar rigid-body systems on $\text{SE} (2)$ is used to illustrate our approach.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problems for networked games have been widely investigated in recent years. Despite the increasing attention, communication expenditure is becoming a major bottleneck for scaling up distributed approaches within limited communication bandwidth between agents. To reduce communication cost, an efficient event-triggered and compressed distributed NE seeking (ETC-DNES) algorithm is proposed in this article to obtain an NE for games over directed graphs, where the communication efficiency is improved by event-triggered exchanges of compressed information among neighbors. ETC-DNES saves communication costs in both transmitted bits and rounds of communication. Furthermore, our method only requires the row-stochastic property of the adjacency matrix, unlike previous approaches that hinged on doubly stochastic communication matrices. We provide convergence guarantees for ETC-DNES on games with restricted strongly monotone mappings and testify its efficiency with no sacrifice on the accuracy. The algorithm and analysis are extended to a compressed algorithm with stochastic event-triggered mechanism, i.e., stochastic event-triggered and compressed distributed NE seeking (SETC-DNES) algorithm. In SETC-DNES, we introduce a random variable in the triggering condition to further enhance the algorithm efficiency. We demonstrate that SETC-DNES guarantees linear convergence to the NE while achieving even greater reductions in communication costs compared to ETC-DNES. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The first Lyapunov function, in the continuous-time framework, covers general (full-order) gradient-like adaptive observer forms—possibly taking into account the presence of projection algorithms and exhibiting piecewise continuous regressor matrices—that have so far restrictively required uniform boundedness of the (everywhere defined) derivative of the regressor. The second Lyapunov function, in the discrete-time framework, owns the advantage feature of being nonanticipating (e.g., characterized by a causal time-varying matrix that is available at runtime), which allows the designer to solve further adaptation issues.},

The main feature of the proposed IDB attack is that, by intercepting the measurement output, the adversary can identify the important packets transmitting among sensing nodes, and by injecting more power to increase the attack success probability (ASP) of these packets, thereby enhancing the attack destructiveness. Then, according to the identified ASP of packets, a scheme is designed to allocate the attack power to each channel with the help of the signal-to-noise ratio such that packets with higher ASP would face attacks with more power. Subsequently, the relationships are characterized among the attack parameter, the ASP, the attack power, and the constrained energy via stochastic analysis method, and the threshold of the attack parameter is designed to achieve a balance between the attack effects and the energy constraint. Finally, an illustrative simulation is given to verify the effectiveness of the stochastic IDB attack strategy and stochastic IDB attack power allocation method.},

Using these concepts, we provide a comprehensive proof for the criterion. Our approach also induces a new, generalized cactus-based graph-theoretic criterion for the structural controllability. This not only extends Lin&#39;s cactus-based graph-theoretic condition to switched systems for the first time, but also provides a lower bound for the generic dimension of controllable subspaces of switched systems.},

  abstract     = {This article studies rigid formation control of multiagent systems with nonlinear uncertainties. Unlike most existing research, ratio-of-distance (RoD) rigidity theory is introduced, and nonlinear uncertainties are thoroughly discussed. Desired formation shapes are formulated by a special class of RoD-based rigid frameworks. This article considers how to design distributed adaptive control protocols to drive all agents to acquire and maintain desired formation shapes while simultaneously maneuvering along with desired velocities. Both time-invariant and time-varying formation maneuvering are involved. Along with leader–follower strategy, subgraphs of RoD-based rigid graphs are extracted out as maneuvering velocity graphs to save resources of velocity communication. As for complicated time-varying situations, the nonsmooth stability analysis based on differential inclusion theory is employed for controller design.},

A time interval is associated with each transition specifying at which clock values it may occur. In addition, a resetting condition associated to a transition specifies how the clock value is updated upon its occurrence. This work deals with the estimation of the current state given a timed observation, i.e., a succession of pairs of an observable event and the time instant at which the event has occurred. The problem of state estimation for a timed automaton is reduced to the reachability analysis of an associated zone automaton, which provides a purely discrete event description of the behavior of the timed automaton. An algorithm is formulated to provide an approach for state estimation of a timed automaton based on the assumption that the clock is reset upon the occurrence of each observable transition.},

A system is said to be predictable with respect to a fault pattern if any complete fault behavior in a fault pattern can be correctly predicted before its occurrence, where the fault patterns are characterized by a particular composition of a labeled Petri net with a fault pattern net. In this article, we construct a fault pattern predictor net and a basis fault pattern predictor graph (PG) that is based on the notion of basis markings. By exploiting the fault pattern predictor net and basis fault pattern PG, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition to check fault pattern predictability, which does not need the full reachability/coverability graph of a net, thus gaining practical computation benefits.},

Instead of using case-by-case relaxation techniques, we propose a tractable first-order method to solve this structural optimal control problem. More specifically, we equivalently reformulate it as a constrained optimization and characterize its first-order optimality condition via Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. To solve this NP-hard problem, we propose a novel optimization method, called log-barrier search (LBS), which incorporates a modified log-barrier term into the control objective function and adaptively changes its parameters during the computation process. The convergence of our method is theoretically guaranteed and at least a stationary solution can be obtained. We compare the proposed method with other existing algorithms, where the LBS method shows a very competitive performance in both speed and optimality.},

The challenge lies in how to design a broadcasting protocol when the communication bit is critical, and to strengthen its security at the same time. A novel rate-coded algorithm is designed for MASs from an encoding–decoding viewpoint, where only an encrypted $L$-length codeword, instead of the sensitive system information, is transmitted over the network between each agent and its neighbors whenever the triggering condition is satisfied. Unlike most existing results, our algorithm&#39;s triggering condition is correlated with the changing rate of the transmitted signal, effectively alleviating the signal distortion problem when its changing rate is too small or too large. As a result, the proposed rate-coded secure control not only ensures uniformly bounded consensus outcomes without continuous monitoring of neighbors&#39; states but also reduces bandwidth requirements and enhances communication security. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical finding.},

We show that our general definition encompasses many of the STL robustness functions in the literature. Most importantly, we show how that our notion of robustness addresses the two main limitations of the the traditional robustness (masking and locality), which currently limit using robustness-based approaches for control. The proposed robustness function parameters affect the conservativeness of the score, and can be chosen based on desired performance. We show how the proposed robustness can be used for control.},

The salient feature of this work is that the switching communication networks can be uniformly strongly connected, and the communication delays are allowed to be arbitrarily unknown, time-varying and bounded. To solve the problem, we construct a distributed estimator for each player to estimate all players&#39; strategies through unreliable communication networks. Based on the gradient play technique, we design a distributed Nash equilibrium seeking law. Then, we obtain the closed-loop system, which is an interconnected system of a nonlinear subsystem and a linear time-delay subsystem. By constructing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, and designing the controller parameter in the sense of the small gain theorem, we achieve robust Nash equilibrium seeking asymptotically in spite of unreliable communication networks. Finally, we illustrate our proposed approach by its application to practical motion control of mobile robots with an experiment.},

The dual equivalent observability problem is identified. It consists of estimating the boundary sources, localized on a given subset of the boundary, out of boundary measurements on the complementary subset. Classical unique continuation and smoothing properties of the heat equation allow us proving approximate tracking controllability properties and the smoothness of the class of trackable trajectories. We also develop a new transmutation method that allows to transfer known results on the sidewise controllability of the wave equation to the tracking controllability of the heat one. Using the flatness approach, we also give explicit estimates on the cost of approximate tracking control.

In this work, the Bayesian theorem plays a crucial role in two key aspects. First, the unknown uncertainties are estimated using Gaussian process models, which provide mean and variance information incorporated into the QP framework to determine the control inputs. The integration ensures the attainment of desired objectives with high probability. Second, the Bayesian optimization algorithm is employed to optimize some hyperparameters.

The article proposes an optimal input design method where the achieved Fisher information matrix (FIM) is fitted to the desired Fisher matrix, together with a coordinate transformation designed to make the regressors in the transformed coordinates have low mutual coherence.

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a solution to the adaptive coordination control problem for networked Lagrange systems with unknown nonsmooth actuator nonlinearities, which can represent actuator failure/attack, deadzone, backlash, friction, and hysteresis in a unified framework. An auxiliary system is firstly designed for each subsystem over a directed network, in which the final synchronized value can be regulated by given specified initial values. Then, an adaptive controller is proposed for networked Lagrangian systems using an adaptive dynamic gain approach. Asymptotical stability is established by using the Lyapunov direct method. Compared to the adaptive regression approach, the nonsmooth actuator dynamics is not required to be known and the synchronized value can be arbitrarily designed. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the proposed approach.},

In the first and second example, a family of reduced-order models interpolating the response of a nonlinear circuit driven by a Van der Pol oscillator is constructed and higher order families with additional degrees of freedom are presented; in the third example a structure-preserving reduced-order model of a transmission line is constructed by considering a family of interpolants having one more state than the minimal order; and in the final example a differential-algebraic reduced-order model is constructed for a system of semidiscretized Oseen equations to obtain a better high-frequency approximation than what is achievable by a differential reduced-order model.},

The global cost function is considered as the sum of the individual cost functions associated with affine coupling constraints on the clusters&#39; decisions. To solve this problem, the dual problem is formulated by the concept of Fenchel conjugate. Then, an asynchronous distributed dual proximal gradient algorithm is proposed based on a cluster-based partial and mixed consensus protocol, by which the agents are only required to communicate with their neighbors with communication delays. An ergodic convergence result is provided, and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm is verified by solving a social welfare optimization problem in the simulation.},

To guarantee the estimation accuracy of these observers, we formulate a relationship linking the maximum detection delay of unmatched intervals to the minimum dwell time of matched intervals. Capitalizing on the states from the distributed asynchronous observers and employing the backstepping structure, we proceed to design heterogeneous adaptive controllers for the nonlinear MASs.

The transition and sojourn information is incompletely known, and the coupling between the known (or unknown) transition and unknown (or known) sojourn information renders the known probabilistic information difficult to be fully leveraged, which can lead to conservative results in system analysis and synthesis. To approximate the unknown transition and sojourn information, a polyhedral approach is developed, which facilitates the incorporation of the known probabilistic information coupled with unknown information. Accordingly, novel vertex-based Lyapunov functions are proposed to establish stability conditions. New criteria are established for the stability analysis and control of SMJLSs by incorporating all the jointly known transition and sojourn information, all the known probabilistic information, and both the known and the approximation of unknown probabilistic information, respectively. The effectiveness and superiority of the theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical example and a simulated continuous stirred tank reactor process.},

Our first contribution is to provide sufficient conditions for sISS of networks using sISS vector Lyapunov functions. These sufficient conditions are given in terms of the Lyapunov functions of the agents. We use vector Lyapunov functions, the comparison lemma, and contraction analysis to prove the result. Our second contribution provides conditions for sISS of weakly coupled interconnected systems.

On the basis of covariant derivative and parallel transport, the original Cucker–Smale model on complete Riemannian manifolds can reach velocity alignment. By using the logarithm map on Riemannian manifolds, an attractive–repulsive force is added, which enables all agents to achieve collision avoidance and aggregation on Riemannian manifolds. The proposed model is consistent with the related model on the Euclidean space. Moreover, five specific complete Riemannian manifolds are taken into consideration: the unit sphere, the hyperboloid, the infinite cylinder, the unit circle, and the special orthogonal group. After giving the corresponding covariant derivatives, parallel transports, and logarithm maps, the explicit forms of the proposed model on those manifolds are shown.

Robustness thereby reduces to a problem of subspace estimation. This article proposes a new subspace estimator that recovers the non-persistently exciting (non-PE) subspace for a large class of regressors. This is achieved through a characterization of PE subspaces and the use of principal component analysis. Correctness of the design is proved using matrix perturbation theory, while an averaging analysis demonstrates that the design is best employed as a slow process. We develop a general error model capturing those commonly appearing in adaptive control, and we prove that the $\mu$-modification provides a modular robust design, without compromising error regulation.},

Resampling is proposed to guarantee the equivalence of lattice PWA approximations and optimal MPC control law at the sample points. Under certain conditions, the disjunctive lattice PWA approximation constitutes a lower bound, whereas the conjunctive version formulates an upper bound of the original optimal control law. The equivalence of the two lattice PWA approximations then guarantees error-free approximations in the domain of interest, which is tested through a statistical guarantee. The performance of the proposed approximation strategy is tested through two simulation examples, and the results show that error-free lattice PWA approximations can be obtained with low offline complexity and small storage requirements.

To optimize the synchronization performance of such networks, topological adjustments have been identified as effective and efficient ways. This article establishes a theoretical framework for accelerating synchronization convergence by introducing an additional directed edge or increasing edge weight to a network topology. The convergence speed is quantified by the second smallest real part of Laplacian matrix eigenvalues, called Fielder eigenvalue. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing synchronization acceleration with additional edge of single-root digraphs, enabling efficiently screening out all such edges through computation of graph Laplacian eigenspace. Moreover, for a sufficiently small topological variation, the accelerating extent and optimal edge can be approximately estimated as well. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed identification method of acceleration edges.},

In this problem, the system state evolves on the nonlinear manifold $ \mathit{SE}(3)\times \mathbb {R}^{3\mathit{n}}$, on which we design dynamic extensions such that the deterministic VI-SLAM problem can be reformulated—without any approximation—into online constant parameter identification, expressed as a linear regression. This demonstrates that deterministic VI-SLAM can be translated into a linear least squares problem globally and exactly. Based on this observation, we propose a novel SLAM observer, following the recently established parameter estimation-based observer methodology. A notable merit of the proposed observer is its almost global asymptotic stability. Unlike most existing methods, its convergence does not rely on persistency of excitation or uniform complete observability—assumptions commonly used in stability proofs that can be challenging to satisfy in real-world applications.},

In other words, “practical safety” is maintained during the entire period of convergence to the constrained extremum. Our design is based on quadratic program (QP) CBF style filters for safety, which is applied in an average and estimated sense. Using nonsmooth analysis tools, we guarantee semiglobal practical asymptotic (SPA) stability of the global constrained optimum, practical convergence to the safe set if starting in a condition violating the CBF, and practical safety for all time—semiglobally—if starting in safe set. The safety result of this article is analogous with modern notions of SPA stability, guaranteeing that, for any small violation of safety, there exist design coefficients that guarantee that such a small violation is not exceeded. This article outlines a set of sufficient conditions on the barrier and objective functions, and by way of a Lyapunov argument, we demonstrate that nonconvex constrained optimization problems can be solved. We present these results in the setting of a static map and a dynamical system. A simulation example illustrates the results.},

  abstract     = {The linear programming (LP) approach is, together with value iteration and policy iteration, one of the three fundamental methods to solve optimal control problems in a dynamic programming setting. Despite its simple formulation, versatility, and predisposition to be employed in model-free settings, the LP approach has not enjoyed the same popularity as the other methods. The reason is the often poor scalability of the exact LP approach and the difficulty to obtain bounded solutions for a reasonable amount of constraints. We mitigate these issues here, by investigating fundamental geometric features of the LP and developing sufficient conditions to guarantee finite solutions with minimal constraints. In the model-free context, we show that boundedness can be guaranteed by a suitable choice of dataset and objective function.},

In this article, we examine the continuum limit of high-dimensional measurements and analyze state estimation in linear time-invariant systems with infinite-dimensional measurements but finite-dimensional states, both corrupted by additive noise. We propose a linear filter and derive the corresponding optimal gain functional in the sense of the minimum mean square error, analogous to the classic Kalman filter. By modeling the measurement noise as a wide-sense stationary random field, we are able to derive the optimal linear filter explicitly, in contrast to previous derivations of Kalman filters in distributed-parameter settings. Interestingly, we find that we need only impose conditions that are finite-dimensional in nature to ensure that the filter is asymptotically stable. The proposed filter is verified via simulation of a linearized system with a pinhole camera sensor.},

Each subsystem has a local observer and access to one part of the measurement outputs and information exchanged through communication networks. This article focuses on the design of distributed observer with jointly connected directed switching networks. The problem presents challenges due to passive switching modes and the open-loop unboundedness that results from local observability. To overcome these challenges, we develop a network transformation mapping method whereby each local observer can classify itself into an independent subgraph based on independent judgment. Next, an observable decomposition and reorganization method is developed for the digraph case to ensure that each subgraph possesses independent dynamic properties. Asymptotic omniscience is then proven using a developed recursive proof method. This article includes many previous results as special cases, because most are only suitable for undirected switching topologies or fast-switching cases. An adaptive coupling gain design is proposed to simplify the calculation and verification of conditions that guarantee asymptotic omniscience. Finally, simulation results with the power system show the validity of the developed theory.},

At the remote estimator, the batch and iterative expectation–maximization (EM) algorithms are proposed for computing the optimal estimation in the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sense. It is shown that the iterative estimator exhibits a structure similar to that of an information-like type filter. The convergence of the EM algorithm for MAP estimation is investigated, and it is proven that the sequence of estimates converges to a local optimal solution. The computational complexities of both the batch and iterative algorithms are analyzed.

A novel concept of modal functional observability coinciding with the notion of modal observability is proposed. This notion introduces necessary and sufficient conditions for functional observability and detectability in a unified way without resorting to system observability decomposition, and facilitates the design of a functionally observable/detectable system. Afterward, SFO is redefined rigorously from a generic perspective, contrarily to the definition of structural observability. A complete graph-theoretic characterization for SFO is proposed. Based on these results, the problems of selecting the minimal sensors from a prior set to achieve functional observability and SFO are shown to be NP-hard. Nevertheless, supermodular set functions are established, leading to greedy heuristics that can find approximation solutions to these problems with provable guarantees in polynomial time. A closed-form solution along with a constructive procedure is also given for the unconstrained case on systems with diagonalizable state matrices. Notably, our results also yield a polynomial-time verifiable case for structural target controllability, a problem that may be hard otherwise.},

Our derivations combine novel monotonicity properties of clairvoyant policies with suitable terminal ingredients. We prove that our scheme is recursively feasible, stabilizing, and that it achieves bounded regret relative to the infinite horizon clairvoyant policy. Last, we show that the policy optimization problem can be solved efficiently through convex–concave programming.

  abstract     = {This article presents a new paradigm to stabilize uncertain stochastic linear systems. Herein, second moment polytopic (SMP) systems are proposed that generalize systems with both uncertainty and randomness. The SMP systems are characterized by second moments of the stochastic system matrices and the uncertain parameters. Further, a fundamental theory for guaranteeing stability of the SMP systems is established. It is challenging to analyze the SMP systems owing to both the uncertainty and randomness. An idea to overcome this difficulty is to expand the SMP systems and exclude the randomness. Because the expanded systems contain only the uncertainty, their stability can be analyzed via robust stability theory. The stability of the expanded systems is equivalent to statistical stability of the SMP systems. These facts provide sufficient conditions for the stability of the SMP systems as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In controller design for the SMP systems, the LMIs reduce to cubic matrix inequalities (CMIs) whose solutions correspond to feedback gains. The CMIs are transformed into simpler quadratic matrix inequalities (QMIs) that can be solved using optimization techniques. Moreover, solving such nonconvex QMIs is relaxed into the iteration of a convex optimization. Solutions to the iterative optimization provide feedback gains that stabilize the SMP systems. As demonstrated here, the SMP systems represent linear dynamics with uncertain distributions and other existing systems such as independently identically distributed dynamics and random polytopes. Finally, a numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Through deriving properties of switching laws regarding signs and dimension, this article proposes a definite condition for time-optimal control. Guided by the developed theory, a trajectory planning method named the manifold-intercept method (MIM) is developed. The proposed MIM can plan time-optimal jerk-limited trajectories with full state constraints, and can also plan near-optimal nonchattering higher order trajectories with negligible extra motion time compared to optimal profiles. Numerical results indicate that the proposed MIM outperforms all baselines in computational time, computational accuracy, and trajectory quality by a large gap.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we examine the model reference adaptive control problem when the commonly used projection algorithm is utilized, subject to several common assumptions on the set of admissible parameters, in particular a compactness constraint as well as knowledge of the sign of the high-frequency gain. It is proven in the literature that for this setup, the closed-loop system is bounded-input bounded-state; since the closed-loop system is not linear time-invariant, this does not imply a bounded gain. Here, we prove a much crisper and detailed bound on the closed-loop behavior consisting of three terms: a decaying exponential on the initial condition, a linear-like convolution bound on the exogenous inputs, and a constant scaled by the square root of the constant in the denominator of the estimator update law; we also provide an upper bound on the two-norm of the tracking error. We then demonstrate that the same kind of bounds hold in the presence of a degree of unmodeled dynamics and plant parameter time-variation.},

  abstract     = {In decentralized optimization, nodes of a communication network each possess a local objective function, and communicate using gossip-based methods in order to minimize the average of these per-node functions. While synchronous algorithms are heavily impacted by a few slow nodes or edges in the graph (the straggler problem), their asynchronous counterparts are notoriously harder to parameterize. Indeed, their convergence properties for networks with heterogeneous communication and computation delays have defied analysis so far. In this article, we use a continuized framework to analyze asynchronous algorithms in networks with delays. Our approach yields a precise characterization of convergence time and of its dependence on heterogeneous delays in the network. Our continuized framework benefits from the best of both continuous and discrete worlds: the algorithms it applies to are based on event-driven updates. They are thus essentially discrete, and hence, readily implementable. Yet their analysis is essentially in continuous time, relying in part on the theory of delayed ordinary differential equations. Our algorithms moreover achieve an asynchronous speedup: their rate of convergence is controlled by the eigengap of the network graph weighted by local delays instead of the network-wide worst-case delay as in previous analyses. Our methods thus enjoy improved robustness to stragglers.},

  abstract     = {System stabilization via policy gradient (PG) methods has drawn increasing attention in both control and machine learning communities. In this article, we study their convergence and sample complexity for stabilizing linear time-invariant systems in terms of the number of system rollouts. Our analysis is built upon a discounted linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method which alternatively updates the policy and the discount factor of the LQR problem. First, we propose an explicit rule to adaptively adjust the discount factor by exploring the stability margin of a linear control policy. Then, we establish the sample complexity of PG methods for stabilization, which only adds a coefficient logarithmic in the spectral radius of the state matrix to that for solving the LQR problem with a prior stabilizing policy. Finally, we perform simulations to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a class of nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {Safety control of dynamical systems using barrier functions relies on knowing the full state information. This article introduces a novel approach for safety control in uncertain multiple-input–muiltiple-output (MIMO) systems with partial state information. The proposed method combines the synthesis of a vector norm barrier function and a dynamic output feedback safety controller to ensure robust safety enforcement. The safety controller guarantees the invariance of the barrier function under uncertain dynamics and disturbances. To address the challenges associated with safety verification using partial state information, a barrier function estimator is developed. This estimator employs an identifier-based state estimator to obtain a state estimate that is affine in the uncertain model parameters of the system. By incorporating a priori knowledge of the limits of the uncertain model parameters and disturbances, the state estimate provides a robust upper bound for the barrier function. Comparative analysis with existing control barrier function-based methods shows the advantage of the proposed approach in enforcing safety constraints under tight input constraints and the utilization of estimated state information.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we address a class of Nash games with nonconvex coupling constraints for which we define a novel notion of local equilibrium, here named local generalized Nash equilibrium (LGNE). Our first technical contribution is to show the stability in the game theoretic sense of these equilibria on a specific local subset of the original feasible set. Remarkably, we show that the proposed notion of local equilibrium can be equivalently formulated as the solution of a quasi-variational inequality with equal Lagrange multipliers. Next, under the additional proximal smoothness assumption of the coupled feasible set, we define conditions for the existence and local uniqueness of an LGNE. To compute such an equilibrium, we propose two discrete-time dynamics, or fixed-point iterations implemented in a centralized fashion. Our third technical contribution is to prove convergence under (strongly) monotone assumptions on the pseudogradient mapping of the game and proximal smoothness of the coupled feasible set. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to a noncooperative version of the optimal power flow control problem.},

  abstract     = {In Part I, a novel Galerkin-type method for finite dimensional approximations of transfer functions in Hardy space was developed based on approximation by simple poles. In Part II, this approximation is applied to system level synthesis, a recent approach based on a clever reparameterization, to develop a new technique for optimal control design. To solve system level synthesis problems, prior work relies on finite impulse response approximations that lead to deadbeat control, and that can experience infeasibility and increased suboptimality, especially in systems with large separation of time scales. The new design method does not result in deadbeat control, is convex and tractable, always feasible, can incorporate prior knowledge, and works well for systems with large separation of time scales. Suboptimality bounds with convergence rate depending on the geometry of the pole selection are provided. An example demonstrates superior performance of the method.},
