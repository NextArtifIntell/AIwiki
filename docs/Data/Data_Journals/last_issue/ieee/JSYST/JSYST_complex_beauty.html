The global cost function is subjected to a constraint with an aggregative item, which reveals the degree of aggregation for the multiagent system. A distributed strategy is proposed to optimize the formation configuration at multiple scales, including the position, angle, and size of the formation configuration. The strategy first employs observation and parameter projection technologies to search for the optimal size. Then, it utilizes the gradient and moment to optimize the position and angle of the formation configuration synchronously. Finally, some simulation results are provided to verify the proposed strategy.},

However, existing work has primarily provided proof of concept in regular, open arenas without obstacles. For practical applications on real robots, multiple collective motion skills are required. This article proposes a novel, multitask deep reinforcement learning algorithm and domain transfer architecture permitting multiple collective motion skills to be bootstrapped automatically and applied to real robots. The proposed approach is tested for tuning two collective motion skills for grouped movement and obstacle avoidance, without requiring a map of the environment. We show that our approach can tune obstacle avoidance parameters while maintaining high-quality swarming collective behavior when an obstacle is detected. Furthermore, learned collective motion skills can be transferred from a point mass simulation onto real mobile robots using our domain transfer architecture, without loss of quality. Transferability is comparable to that of an evolutionary algorithm run in a high-fidelity simulator.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles trained through multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) have shown impressive results in many driving scenarios. However, the performance of these trained policies can be impacted when faced with diverse driving styles and personalities, particularly in highly interactive situations. This is because conventional MARL algorithms usually operate under the assumption of fully cooperative behavior among all agents and focus on maximizing team rewards during training. To address this issue, we introduce the personality modeling network (PeMN), which includes a cooperation value function and personality parameters to model the varied interactions in high-interactive scenarios. The PeMN also enables the training of a background traffic flow with diverse behaviors, thereby improving the performance and generalization of the ego vehicle. Our extensive experimental studies, which incorporate different personality parameters in high-interactive driving scenarios, demonstrate that the personality parameters effectively model diverse driving styles and that policies trained with PeMN demonstrate better generalization than traditional MARL methods.},

  abstract     = {The age of information (AoI) has recently gained recognition as a critical quality-of-service (QoS) metric for quantifying the freshness of status updates, playing a crucial role in supporting massive ultrareliable and low-latency communications (mURLLCs). In mURLLC scenarios, status updates generally involve the transmission through applying finite blocklength coding (FBC) to efficiently encode small update packets while meeting stringent error-rate and latency-bounded QoS constraints. However, due to inherent system dynamics and varying environmental conditions, optimizing AoI under such multi-QoS constraints often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable problems. Motivated by the demonstrated efficacy of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in addressing large-scale networking challenges, this work aims to apply DRL techniques to derive optimal resource allocation solutions in real time. Despite its potential, the effective integration of FBC in DRL-based AoI optimization remains underexplored, especially in addressing the challenge of simultaneously upper bounding both delay and error rate. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based framework for AoI-aware optimal resource allocation in mURLLC-driven multi-QoS schemes, leveraging AoI as a core metric within the finite blocklength regime. First, we design a wireless communication architecture and AoI-based modeling framework that incorporates FBC. Second, we proceed by deriving upper bounded peak AoI and delay violation probabilities using stochastic network calculus. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the peak AoI violation probability through FBC. Third, we develop DRL algorithms to determine optimal resource allocation policies that meet statistical delay and error-rate requirements for mURLLC. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the developed schemes, we have executed a series of simulations.},

The method is based on intracluster and intercluster distance evaluations to achieve a good partition. A quasi-convex curve is formed to select the optimal NoC, ensuring an excellent computational time to converge. Tests are carried out using K-means, and simulations are conducted using IEEE unbalanced test feeders. Different input random variables are tested, including correlated and noncorrelated variables, with and without renewable distributed generators. The results prove that the input conditions significantly affect the optimal NoC. Comparisons are made with Monte Carlo simulation to justify the proposed application, showing that the computational time reduction provided by the clustering algorithm reaches up to ∼99% . Since the optimal NoC increases dramatically with the size of the input database, guidelines are proposed to reduce the MPPF dimensionality for more effective probabilistic procedures.},

  abstract     = {The growth of distributed renewable energy in microgrids (MGs) raises challenges in energy management and consumption. As an innovative approach, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers a promising solution to address these problems. In this article, we propose a bi-layer decentralized (BLD) optimization algorithm for P2P energy trading in multimicrogrids (MMG). Compared with traditional optimization algorithms that are single-layer decentralized (i.e., decentralizing solely at inter-MG trading and typically centralizing prosumers within the MG), the proposed algorithm achieves bi-layer decentralization (i.e., decentralization extends to both inter-MG and intra-MG trading). In this way, the BLD algorithm can significantly preserve the information privacy and decision independence of prosumers. In addition, the proposed algorithm can efficiently manage power flow in a decentralized manner at both layers, whereas existing decentralized algorithms frequently neglect this critical feature. Furthermore, an accelerated BLD (ABLD) algorithm is proposed to address time-consuming issues in this nested P2P trading for MMG. Numerical simulations on various test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the error of the proposed algorithm is below 0.1%. In addition, BLD requires 15602.03 s to converge with 560 prosumers, while ABLD only requires 228.05 s.},

However, the challenge lies in distinguishing between short-circuit faults and system disturbances, e.g., load encroachment, power swing, out-of-step condition, and voltage instability, which can mimic fault conditions and lead to improper relay operation. To address this issue, this article presents a new local protection method by employing three innovative indices: the out-of-step detection index, the positive-sequence impedance angle (PSIA) index, and the superimposed PSIA index. These indices are derived from theoretical principles and are tailored to effectively discriminate between faults and system disturbances. As a major novelty, the determination of indices threshold values is extracted based on the theoretical relationships and further validated through comprehensive static and dynamic analyses. The algorithm&#39;s effectiveness is evaluated under various stressed conditions through multiple simulations, showing its ability to distinguish between stressed conditions and short-circuit faults, even in the presence of inverter-based resources. This leads to enhanced power system reliability and security. The proposed method is also cost-effective as it is implemented in the local distance relay, eliminating the need for synchrophasor devices and communication infrastructure.},

In this article, we propose a time-efficient greedy search method to identify critical branches in a power network. We address the challenge of computational constraints by using a failure propagation graph, which accurately captures the critical failure propagation patterns based on cascading failure simulation. Our approach minimizes cascading failure risk while strategically reinforcing a limited number of branches. The failure-propagation-graph greedy-search (FPG-GS) algorithm selects candidate branches based on cascading failure simulation and iteratively identifies the most crucial branches. Our experimental results on different power systems demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the FPG-GS algorithm compared to existing methods. In addition, our study highlights the importance of strategic branch selection, showing that reinforcing one-fifth of the branches can achieve a mitigation rate exceeding 80%.},

Enabling caching capabilities has been regarded as a promising way to reduce the high-delay pressure of file delivery on the backhaul links. However, file delivery has different requirements on quality-of-service, and the increased densification of small base stations will consume more energy, thus it is essential to solve the problem of delay and energy in cache-enabled HetCNets. In this article, we employ a utility function with the weighted sum of energy consumption and delay cost to formulate the delay-energy tradeoff optimization problem that is a kind of multiobjective optimization problem. Considering a jointly performed mechanism comprising power control, user association, and content caching, the optimization problem is further decomposed into the primal problem and the main problem by generalized Benders decomposition method. Here, the primal problem is related to power-aware user association that dynamically associates with the base station, and the main problem is related to content caching. Furthermore, an iterative power-aware user association and content caching algorithm (PAUA-CC) is proposed.

To achieve this, a utility function is developed to evaluate the coalition structure, transmit power consumption, and tracking accuracy. Then, by formulating the cooperative interactions among radars as a coalition game, we establish an optimization model to optimize the coalition structure and power allocation for the distributed radar network. The existence of the Nash equilibrium solution for the game is proven mathematically. To address the optimization model, an iterative three-step algorithm is developed based on the sequential quadratic programming.

To overcome these challenges, a lightweight AKA protocol with self-adaptive synchronization and authority management is proposed. Formal verification through the real-or-random model, BAN logic, and ProVerif tool confirms its security and availability, while informal analysis demonstrates its robust security features. Comparative analysis with recent schemes also highlights its superiority and fitness for WMSNs.},

  abstract     = {Network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) cell-free massive multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which virtually achieve FD transmission by employing half-duplex access points (APs) to simultaneously serve uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users on the same frequency bands, can decrease latency and enhance reliability since self-interference cancellation is unnecessary and macrodiversity is provided, thus helping industrial ultrareliable low-latency communication applications. In this article, we consider a monitoring scenario of industrial automation in NAFD cell-free systems using finite blocklength codewords and analyze UL and DL signals, end-to-end (E2E) delay, and E2E decoding error probability (DEP). Then, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum E2E DEP among all actuators by jointly designing AP working mode, UL and DL blocklengths under the E2E delay constraint. We propose the estimation of distribution algorithm-differential evolution (EDA-DE) method with low complexity to obtain a near-optimal solution, where the block coordinate descent is used to divide this problem into two parts. The first AP working mode selection is solved by EDA, and the second UL and DL blocklengths are designed by DE. Simulation results indicate that the performance of our proposed EDA-DE method is close to that of exhaustive search with lower computational complexity.},

Specifically, to address the practical limitation that communication links between subsystems of IMMPSs may be unavailable, we first formulate a sparse LQT problem in which the sparse patterns of controllers match the actual communication links. Meanwhile, in order to be applicable to real-time applications while overcoming model uncertainty caused by parameter variability common in IMMPSs models, we subsequently develop a data compression-based model-free PI algorithm for the abovementioned sparse LQT problem. The main advantages of this algorithm over existing algorithms for IMMPSs control are threefold: first, it has the ability to operate without a prior knowledge of system model, second, its embedded data compression significantly reduces the time consumption for controller design, making it suitable for real-time applications, and third, it designs controllers based on actual communication links, making it practical for applications where communication infrastructure may be constrained. Finally the efficacy of the proposed algorithm is verified through the IEEE 39-bus New England Power System.},

  abstract     = {Numerous mission-critical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations, such as rescue and surveillance missions, are conducted in areas lacking access to external infrastructure providing precise positioning information. To enhance situational awareness in such scenarios, millimeter wave (mmWave, $\text{30}-\text{300}$ GHz) and subterahertz (sub-THz, $\text{100}-\text{300}$ GHz) range or Doppler radars promising large resolution can be employed. However, the small antenna apertures in these bands naturally call for the use of massive antenna arrays to achieve reasonable detection distances. By employing directional antenna arrays, these radars need to exhaustively scan the surroundings to ensure situational awareness of a UAV in a swarm. The aim of this article is to characterize the system-level performance of mmWave/sub-THz range and Doppler radars as a function of system parameters by accounting for the propagation specifics of the considered bands. To this aim, we combine the tools of stochastic geometry and antenna simulations to determine the optimal half-power beamwidth that minimizes the full scanning time while maximizing the detection probability of all UAVs in a swarm. Our results demonstrate that both types of radars are characterized by qualitatively similar performance. Detection performance is highly sensitive to both UAV density and coverage radius, as the increase in these parameters leads to an abrupt drop in the detection performance. At small distances, $\leq\!\text{50}$ m, antenna arrays with a smaller number of elements result in the best tradeoff between scanning time and detection probability. Specifically, both types of radars provide perfect knowledge of the surroundings (with detection probability higher than 0.99) within a 50-m radius with a scanning time of less than 1 ms. At greater distances, $\geq\! \text{100}$ m, the only option to improve performance is a drastic increase in the emitted power or receiver sensitivity.},

Therefore, this article proposes $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ resilient bipartite control method to address the security problem of network information interaction among agents within competitive and cooperative multiagent systems. When the communication networks among agents are subject to a replay attack, the system model integrating multisensor weight fusion with an unknown input leader is established first. Then, a detection fusion algorithm is proposed to simultaneously uncover attacker behavior and identify tampered sensors. Considering the intermittent or interrupted communication resulting from the time variability of topology switching among agents, the switching topology is modeled by a semi-Markov process within a signed graph having positive and negative interaction weights. Subsequently, a distributed observer is designed to estimate the unknown input leader, utilizing the semi-Markov interactions among agents and incorporating an adaptive update mechanism to eliminate the dependency on global topology information. Ulteriorly, by solving convex optimization problems, a distributed resilient bipartite controller relying on the observer state is formulated, and achieves the expected $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance while remaining resilient against replay attacks. Finally, the superiority of the proposed method is validated through comparative examples.},

Hence, robustness against disturbances in affine formation control has been a subject remaining to be determined. To address this problem, a continuous robust controller is introduced in this study, leveraging the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) approach, aiming to suppress external disturbances while ensuring efficient convergence speed of the system under various collective formation maneuvers determined by the leader. The controller is designed to handle two types of disturbance models: one involving general disturbances and the other considering time-delay disturbances. It consists of formation tracking terms based on stress matrices and graph theory, as well as disturbance suppression terms utilizing RISE. Sufficient conditions for the stability of affine formations under both types of disturbances are derived. By designing a Lyapunov function that integrates a class-P function, the exponential stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously demonstrated. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Furthermore, through a novel gain-scheduled state observer, the fuzzy logic systems are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. The dynamic surface design method is used to remove the need for derivative calculations of the constructed virtual controls, significantly the complexity of calculations. In addition, under the framework of backstepping design, the switching threshold event-triggered control strategy is developed to effectively decrease the communication load and balance the performance of MASs. The proposed control protocol ensures that all signals within the closed-loop systems are ultimately bounded under the MDADT switching property.

Balancing these factors is a key challenge for modern green data centers. In this research, we propose a monitoring, visualization, and management system for green data centers (MVMS-GDC). Our comprehensive automated platform includes “monitoring system” and “rules and policy management” modules. The “monitoring system” gathers and visualizes time series data from all resources of a green data center, tracking essential metrics and measurements. It audits green energy, microgrid, climate conditions, workloads, hardware, CPU and memory usage, cluster component health, computing node activities, and network health and quality metrics. The “rules and policy management” module defines and enforces policies to balance resources, ensuring a reliable, sustainable, scalable, and efficient computing environment. We implemented, tested, and evaluated the MVMS-GDC system using green energy at the Zephyr data center located at the GLEAMM site. Our results demonstrate at least a 4.9% improvement in performance, at least a 4% increase in energy efficiency, and a reduction of at least 4% in job losses. The MVMS-GDC system also enhances scalability by employing a policy machine for each compute node, which automates power state control (on, off, or hibernation) based on monitoring observations. This automated approach ensures efficient and dynamic scaling, making MVMS-GDC suitable for large and highly distributed data centers. Overall, MVMS-GDC provides a robust solution for balancing energy availability and computational needs, optimizing performance, and maintaining energy efficiency in green data centers.},

This study proposes a virtual-real synchronization method for digital twins of an aeroengine gas path system (AGPS) based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). First, the parameters are divided into directly measurable parameters (DMP) and nondirectly measurable parameters (NDMP). Then, different algorithms are applied to different types of parameters. An unscented Kalman filtering algorithm is utilized to aid in the synchronization of the DMP. An RL approach is employed to train parameter inference models for the NDMP. By combining the two algorithms, synchronization between these two parameter classes is achieved. This method excels by integrating the NDMP into the virtual-real synchronization of the AGPS digital twin, concurrently reducing the inference time for this specific segment. Comparative experiments are conducted, and the results indicate an effective improvement in the accuracy of parameter inference with the proposed method. Simultaneously, it ensures real-time and robust parameter inference.},

This article explores optimal UAV positioning to maximize coverage in hybrid aerial–ground communication links. Exploiting a probabilistic line-of-sight (LOS) model, we examine coverage radius behavior in mixed urban and suburban environments to meet specific quality-of-service (QoS) targets. The analysis reveals that the coverage radius expands as the probability of LOS increases, which in turn increases with the UAV height. However, beyond a certain height, path loss becomes dominant, and further increases in altitude negatively impact the coverage radius. By studying the maximum coverage radius for minimum signal strength and spectral efficiency requirements, we numerically determine a configuration space of UAV altitudes and the corresponding maximum radius that satisfies the target QoS. The results illustrate a dual-regime behavior, where coverage increases with altitude up to a certain value, beyond which it declines, indicating the existence of an optimal altitude for reliability. In addition, the analysis of ground surface effects shows that flying over concrete surfaces significantly enhances coverage, offering a radius up to five times larger compared to rough, vegetated surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) plays a pivotal role in the Internet of Vehicles and the Internet of Things. Edge server deployment is the initial step in establishing edge computing systems, which impact the overall system performance significantly. Besides, the performance of an edge computing system is also contingent upon the type of service deployed on servers, in the case of the same server deployment, different deployment of services will bring different profits. Most current studies concentrate solely on the former aspect, neglecting the optimization of service deployment in MEC system. In this article, we proposed a two-step method KPSOP for edge server and edge service deployment, aiming to reduce time delay, balance load, and improve the profit of MEC system, and KPSOP includes clustering algorithm and heuristic algorithm. We considered the location distribution of base stations, the task requests of vehicle users, the resource limitations of edge servers, etc. First, the edge server deployment was completed with the goal of minimizing time delay and load balancing. Second, the service deployment was completed with the goal of maximizing edge server profit. The experiments were based on real world base station information. The simulation results validate that our algorithm is more stable and converges faster. In addition, compared to other algorithms, it performs better in load balance and increasing profit.},

The research utilizes orthogonal arrays in combination with regression analysis to systematically test the parameter space of an engineered system function. We explored the parameter space of interest and detected where the system model does not comply with a defined measure of effectiveness. The findings from this case study suggest that these methods enable a systematic exploration of the system&#39;s parameter space, allowing for the effective detection of detrimental weak emergent behavior. This approach potentially enhances test coverage, expands system operating knowledge and facilitates mitigation efforts more efficiently.},

  abstract     = {The design of low-complexity data detection techniques for massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems continues to attract considerable industry and research attention due to the critical need to achieve the right tradeoff between complexity and performance, especially with the signed quadrature spatial modulation (SQSM) scheme. However, the SQSM scheme attains a high spectral efficiency and good performance but suffers from a high computational complexity with mMIMO systems. In this article, we propose an efficient low-complexity detection framework for the SQSM scheme. Sparsity detection is amalgamated in this article with minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector by decoupling the detection of the real and imaginary vector streams. Unfortunately, the MMSE-based detector has a matrix inversion which incurs a high computational complexity. Therefore, we employed several iterative methods; i.e., conjugate gradient and Gauss–Seidel, to avoid the exact matrix inversion, and hence, the computational complexity is significantly reduced. Moreover, the proposed framework can host other iterative methods such as the JA, successive over relaxation, accelerated over relaxation, Neumann series, Newton iteration, two-parameter over relaxation, and Richardson methods. The proposed detection framework attains a significant complexity reduction with a small or insignificant deterioration in the performance.},

  abstract     = {Based on model predictive control and an attack detection mechanism, the stabilization problem of a class of nonlinear discrete-time cyber–physical systems with deception attacks at the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator communication channels is studied. In this article, the deception attacks on both ends of the controller are considered using a more generic probability model. Attack detection models and mechanisms are established to detect the integrity of transmitted information in order to mitigate the impact of deception attacks. To ensure the input-to-state practical stability of the closed-loop system, a model predictive controller is designed based on the detected state. Finally, a simulation case is presented to demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Despite great progress in modeling the resilience response of power systems under extreme events, it remains difficult to assess the evolutionary trend of system performance at a specific observation moment during such events. Conventional simulation-based assessment methods are typically time-consuming because a series of scenario-specific optimization problems must be solved as a prerequisite. Thus, a spatial-temporal graph-based approach is proposed for fast resilience assessment to provide timely warning information. The key factors, including observable meteorological information, component vulnerabilities, emergency dispatch, and repair strategies, are modeled in the form of matrices that depict the spatial and temporal relationships. Based on these matrices, a spatiotemporal graph neural network is developed to fit the mapping relationship between observable states and resilience indicators, which is trained offline and enables fast assessment via forward inference. Regarding the uncertainties of various extreme scenarios, the evaluation procedure combines the whole-process simulation and single-state replay technologies, which can respectively consider the uncertainties and provide deterministic data labeling for assessment. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the benchmarks, including the IEEE 118-bus system and a realistic 2868-bus system.},
