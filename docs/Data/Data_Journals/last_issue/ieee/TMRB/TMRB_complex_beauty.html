  abstract     = {Bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive and effective method for early lung cancer diagnosis. Traditional bronchoscopy faces challenges such as limited dexterity, operator fatigue, and difficulty in maintaining steady manipulation. Existing robot-assisted methods have deficiencies, such as tool instability due to the dynamic respiratory environment. This paper presents a teleoperated robotic bronchoscopy system, featuring a controllable variable-stiffness catheter that enhances stability and flexibility during transbronchial biopsies. The 7 DoF robotic system allows for translation, rotation, and bending of the bronchoscope; delivery and bending of the catheter; delivery and control of biopsy tools; as well as stiffness adjustment of the catheter, which adapts to the dynamic pulmonary environment to provide stable support during tissue sampling. Key contributions include the robotic platform integrated with the variable-stiffness catheter and the implementation of a novel three-stage procedure for tissue sampling. The robotic system has been thoroughly evaluated through a series of tests, including the system accuracy, characterization of the variable-stiffness catheter’s flexibility, force exertion, safety during operation, temperature control, and in-vivo experiment. The results demonstrated the system’s feasibility and effectiveness, with metrics such as safe force limits, system flexibility, and positioning accuracy, showing its potential to improve the accuracy and safety of traditional bronchoscopy procedures.},

  abstract     = {Laryngectomy, a surgical intervention for laryngeal cancer, effectively treats the condition but results in the loss of natural speech. Voice restoration post-laryngectomy typically involves manual control, limiting patients’ ability to multitask while speaking. Surface electromyography (sEMG) offers a hands-free alternative for controlling artificial voice systems. However, challenges arise from daily, orofacial activities like chewing or coughing, activating the same muscles used for sEMG control, potentially causing false triggers. To address this, we perform a detailed analysis of facial and neck muscles during speech and non-speech activities to identify potential false triggers for sEMG-controlled artificial voice systems. We propose a five-step algorithm to prepare noisy sEMG data for analysis and to detect accurate speech onset and termination times within the muscle activity. A two-stage classification approach is suggested to effectively distinguish speech from non-speech activities. The classifier in the first stage detects the presence of any activity versus non-activity with an F1-score of 95.8%, while the classifier in the second stage recognizes speech among other activities with an F1-score of 96.3%. This research marks a significant advancement in differentiating speech from other daily activities, thereby minimizing false triggers in sEMG-controlled artificial voice systems.},

  abstract     = {Prior models of continuously flexible robots typically assume uniform stiffness, and in this paper we relax this assumption. Geometrically varying stiffness profiles provide additional design freedom to influence the motions and workspaces of continuum robots. These results are timely, because with recent rapid advancements in multimaterial additive manufacturing techniques, it is now straightforward to create more complex stiffness profiles in robots. The key insight of this paper is to project forces and moments applied to the robot onto its center of stiffness (i.e., the Young’s modulus-weighted center of each cross section). We show how the center of stiffness can be thought of as analogous to a “precurved backbone” in a robot with uniform stiffness. This analogy enables a large body of prior work in Cosserat Rod modeling of such robots to be applied directly to those with stiffness variations. We experimentally validate this approach using multimaterial, soft, tendon-actuated robots. Lastly, to illustrate how these results can be used in practice, we investigate how stiffness variation can improve performance in a neurosurgical task.},

  abstract     = {Multiple pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) connected through antagonistic joints are more in line with the motion characteristics of human muscles, which better imitate/replace humans to complete a series of actual tasks, such as transportation and assembly. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive solutions to handle hysteresis, creep, input delay, and other inherent characteristics of PAMs, as well as synchronous control and obstacle avoidance that are important to multiple muscles working together. To this end, this paper proposes a new neuroadaptive synchronization controller for 3-D antagonistic PAM-actuated robot hands, which also elaborately designs auxiliary terms to realize obstacle avoidance in Cartesian space and motion constraints in joint space together. Here, dynamic obstacles are regarded as external independent objects, whose nonlinear dynamics are introduced into the proposed controller to restrict end-effectors. Meanwhile, the constraint terms of joint angles and angle velocities are designed as time-varying proportional-differential gains, instead of common barrier functions that may induce overlarge inputs. Particularly, this paper proposes an accelerated gradient-based learning term to relax the linear parameterization condition of uncertain/unmodeled dynamics and obtain accurate weight estimates, based on which, it is proven that both tracking errors and synchronous errors rapidly converge to zero. In addition to complete theoretical analysis, some hardware experiments also verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {Myoelectric control models enabling accurate hand gesture recognition via electromyography (EMG) have attracted increasing attentions in rehabilitation robotics. Adapting pre-trained models to new users is a main challenge in real world applications due to the inter-user different EMG characteristics. Most previous transfer learning approaches employed a rigid model calibration process, usually in a supervised manner with ground truth labels, or in an unsupervised manner but still requiring users to perform pre-defined hand gestures to update model parameters. We argue that such a rigid model calibration process lacks flexibility and limit the translation of myoelectric control into real world practice. In this work, we gradually “flexibilize” the standard model calibration process toward a highly flexible version, which does not require the labels of calibration data, and can be performed on only a subset of pre-defined hand gestures or even unknown user-defined hand gestures. We identify those key components contributing to the performance difference along the way. Compared with the supervised method, the unsupervised model calibration even contributed to a 10% improvement ( ${p}\lt 0.05$ ) in case where only a subset of gesture categories were available for model calibration. Moreover, the unsupervised model calibration achieved a highest recognition accuracy of 86.57% using unknown user-defined gestures, with no significant difference compared to the accuracy with pre-defined gestures ( ${p}\gt 0.05$ ).},

Structurally, the design incorporates a multi-link coupling mechanism driven by a single motor equipped with a series elastic actuator (SEA). The SEA enables bidirectional compliant drive and fore feedback without the need for a force sensor. The connecting rod is optimized to facilitate the natural flexion and extension of the fingers. For control, an admittance control strategy based on real-time fusion of electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is proposed. EMG signals are used to estimate muscle strength and control the movement of the exoskeleton. EEG signals reflect the active intention of the subjects, and admittance control adjusts the rehabilitation strategy in real-time. For the first time, the degree of concentration is used as a parameter for subject adjustment of rehabilitation training. Finally, experiments on stiffness calibration, muscle force estimation, and admittance control based on EEG-EMG fusion were conducted. The results indicate that the normalized root-mean-square-error (NRMSE) of stiffness calibration is 8.32%. The average inconsistence of concentration and joint torque (ICJT) is 73.18%. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can enhance the subjective participation of the subjects in the rehabilitation process, thereby improving the overall rehabilitation outcomes.},

This study proposed a novel muscle synergy-based musculoskeletal model (MM) for prediction of hand and wrist movements, including wrist flexion/extension, wrist adduction/abduction, wrist pronation/supination, and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) flexion/extension. Ten limb-intact subjects were recruited for the offline experiment, and 15-channel EMG signals from the subject’s forearm were recorded. Using the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm, four pairs of excitation signals were extracted from the multi-channel EMG signals. Then the MM driven by the extracted muscle excitations was adopted to predict hand and wrist movements. The proposed method was compared with the NMF algorithm and artificial neural network (ANN), and the prediction performance of the three was evaluated with Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The total average r of the proposed MM was 0.8475 across all subjects and all movement types, approximately 0.123 higher than NMF algorithm and 0.106 higher than ANN. In addition, the total average NRMSE of the proposed MM was 0.16125 across all subjects and all movement types, approximately 0.074 lower than NMF algorithm and 0.037 lower than ANN. In brief, the proposed MM showed significantly improved prediction accuracy over the NMF algorithm and ANN.

The primary challenge in KMG technology lies in the required number and placement of magnetic sensors to balance accuracy, sustainability, and cost-efficiency for practical hand gesture interpretation. To tackle this issue, we propose a Stochastic Sequential Strategy for Magnetic Sensory Selection (S3MSS). We apply this strategy to a configuration of 16 magnetic sensors surrounding surgically implanted magnets in a patient’s forearm. The method uses an Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) framework with Multiclass Linear Discriminant Analysis (MCLDA) and Multiclass Support Vector Machines (MCSVM). Our approach emphasizes robust sensory selection and consistent performance through time-based seeding and K-fold cross-validation. Clinical results indicate consistency in sensory selection across two independent trials, underlining this factor as crucial for reliability. Statistical significance test confirms the superiority of the MCLDA over the MCSVM approach, achieving a 93% accuracy in the classification of Fingers, Wrist, and Thumb gestures using only five sensors near the magnets’ motion range. This underscores our strategy’s effectiveness in accurately detecting hand movements, highlighting its potential for clinical application and improving amputees’ quality of life.},

We characterized the actuator (approximately $8 Nm$ at 90° at $70 kPa$ ) and demonstrated its good transparency, both from a kinematic and a muscular standpoint. Then, on 11 healthy individuals, we showed reductions in shoulder muscle activity (both at the anterior and middle deltoid) while performing a lift and hold task, ranging from 16% to almost 60% of the maximum voluntary contraction. More importantly, we confirmed these effects on two SCI individuals SCI, at two different stages of recovery.

Transparency can be achieved through a bio-inspired exoskeleton design and also by implementing appropriate force control methods to maneuver exoskeleton motions. A new hybrid active-passive Gait Exoskeleton-Assisted Rehabilitation (GEAR) robot is presented here for the rehabilitation of lower limb disabilities. The GEAR robot is designed to enhance transparency incorporating a flexible hip joint and a biomimetic knee joint. The proposed GEAR robot also integrates a Remote Centered Motion (RCM) based passive mechanism to support torso and pelvic motions in two planes and features actuated exoskeleton legs in the sagittal plane for treadmill-assisted walking. The exoskeleton legs are actuated at their hip and knee joints using backdrivable actuators. To provide a natural walking experience, the hip joints of the exoskeleton legs offer two passive degrees of freedom in the frontal and transverse planes in addition to the actuated sagittal plane motion. The biomimetic design of the exoskeleton knee joint ensures alignment with the human anatomical knee joint by closely tracking the latter’s instantaneous center of rotation (ICR). To evaluate GEAR robot’s transparency, a comparative study was conducted, involving three healthy subjects. The participants walked freely on a treadmill and then with the GEAR robot operated first in a completely backdrivable (i.e., passive) mode and subsequently in an active mode. The sEMG data collected during these experiments were analyzed to assess robot’s transparency.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in rescue robots due to their vital role in addressing emergency scenarios and providing crucial assistance in challenging or hazardous situations where human intervention is problematic. However, very few of these robots are capable of actively engaging with humans and undertaking physical manipulation tasks. This limitation is largely attributed to the absence of tools that can realistically simulate physical interactions, especially the contact mechanisms between a robotic gripper and a human body. In this study, we aim to address key limitations in current developments towards robotic casualty manipulation. Firstly, we present an integrative simulation framework for casualty manipulation. We adapt a finite element method (FEM) tool into the grasping and manipulation scenario, and the developed framework can provide accurate biomechanical reactions resulting from manipulation. Secondly, we conduct a detailed assessment of grasping stability during casualty grasping and manipulation simulations. To validate the necessity and superior performance of the proposed high-fidelity simulation framework, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative comparison of grasping stability analyses between the proposed framework and the state-of-the-art multi-body physics simulations. Through these efforts, we have taken the first step towards a feasible solution for robotic casualty manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Surgical workflow anticipation is the task of predicting the timing of relevant surgical events from live video data, which is critical in Robotic-Assisted Surgery (RAS). Accurate predictions require the use of spatial information to model surgical interactions. However, current methods focus solely on surgical instruments, assume static interactions between instruments, and only anticipate surgical events within a fixed time horizon. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive graph learning framework for surgical workflow anticipation based on a novel spatial representation, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce a new representation of spatial information based on bounding boxes of surgical instruments and targets, including their detection confidence levels. These are trained on additional annotations we provide for two benchmark datasets. Second, we design an adaptive graph learning method to capture dynamic interactions. Third, we develop a multi-horizon objective that balances learning objectives for different time horizons, allowing for unconstrained predictions. Evaluations on two benchmarks reveal superior performance in short-to-mid-term anticipation, with an error reduction of approximately 3% for surgical phase anticipation and 9% for remaining surgical duration anticipation. These performance improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight its potential for enhancing preparation and coordination within the RAS team. This can improve surgical safety and the efficiency of operating room usage.},

  abstract     = {In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS), the smoke generated by energy-based surgical instruments blurs and obstructs the endoscopic surgical field, which increases the difficulty and risk of robotic surgery. However, current desmoking research primarily focuses on natural weather conditions, with limited studies addressing desmoking techniques for endoscopic images. Furthermore, surgical smoke presents a notably intricate morphology, and research efforts aimed at uniform, non-uniform, thin, and dense smoke remain relatively limited. This work proposes a Local-Global U-Shaped Transformer Model (LGUformer) based on the U-Net and Transformer architectures to remove complex smoke from endoscopic images. By introducing a local-global multi-head self-attention mechanism and multi-scale depthwise convolution, the proposed model enhances the inference capability. An enhanced feature map fusion method improves the quality of reconstructed images. The improved modules enable efficient handling of variable smoke while generating superior-quality images. Through desmoking experiments on synthetic and real smoke images, the LGUformer model demonstrated superior performance compared with seven other desmoking models in terms of accuracy, clarity, absence of distortion, and robustness. A task-based surgical instrument segmentation experiment indicated the potential of this model as a pre-processing step in visual tasks. Finally, an ablation study was conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed modules.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing textured colon surface maps using a sequence of monocular colonoscopic images together with a 3D colon mesh model that has been segmented in CT colonography. The problem is formulated as a direct bundle adjustment (BA) problem which simultaneously optimizes all camera poses and the intensity of vertices on the pre-operative mesh model. This optimization is achieved by maximizing photometric consistency among multiple views of 2D images and the pre-operative 3D mesh model. The key properties of our proposed direct BA formulation involve eliminating the need for reference image specification, data association (feature extraction and matching), and image depth information. Thus, the proposed method is particularly suitable for scenarios where distinct features and image depth are not available, such as 2D colonoscopic images. Furthermore, we have proven that solving the proposed direct BA using the Gauss-Newton (GN) algorithm has the merit of optimizing camera poses only, which is equivalent to optimizing camera poses and the intensities of 3D vertices on the mesh together. Thus, a direct camera-only BA algorithm is proposed and used for 3D textured colon reconstruction from textureless 2D colonoscopic images. Validations using simulation, phantom, and in-vivo datasets are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular diseases, driven by pollution and unhealthy lifestyle factors, are commonly treated with cardiac catheterization. However, this exposes medical staff to harmful X-ray radiation, leading to the development of robot-assisted catheterization systems for safer procedures. Despite their advantages, existing robotic systems are frequently complex and struggle with catheter maneuverability without a guidewire. This paper introduces a novel two-degree-of-freedom robot-assisted cardiac catheterization system, detailing its development, evaluation, and mathematical modeling. The system is designed for precise control of catheter motion through both translational and rotational movements, enhancing procedural efficiency and safety. We provide an in-depth analysis of deformation forces, stress, and strain characteristics based on catheter materials, supported by comprehensive mathematical modeling of applied forces and torques. Simulation results show that the system requires a torque of 1.870 Nm, a displacement of 0.089 m, and a velocity of 1.450 m/s for translational motion. For rotational motion, the system demands 0.915 Nm of torque, an angle of 5.102 rad, and an angular velocity of 88.735 rad/s. These results are validated against pre-existing models to confirm the system’s performance. The study concludes by presenting a three-dimensional (3D) model of the system, demonstrating its ability to improve the safety and precision of cardiac catheterization.},

This concern is particularly significant in jobs involving awkward postures, e.g., aircraft and vehicle assembly and maintenance. To help address this challenge, we present a comprehensive scoping review examining robots capable of supporting physical balance in healthy individuals. Our analysis involved evaluating their capabilities, observing their functionality, and assessing their practicality. The majority of our findings (81%) were lower body exoskeletons, which, though highly mobile, can be constrained by slow control systems. Conversely, supernumerary robotic limbs and wearable gyroscopes allow unrestricted movement with less constrained control systems. Many experiments lack baseline comparisons without the robot, and some have limited participant recruitment, affecting representation. We recommend universally available testing procedures to effectively demonstrate and compare the capabilities of balance-supporting robots.},

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art steerable needle studies to identify research gaps and aims to deepen understanding the mechanics of active needles in soft tissue, which is critical for design optimization, precise control, and preoperative planning but currently remains unclear. To simplify the analysis, this review suggests separating the mechanics of an active needle into two parts: one for each of the tip and the shaft, where the shaft can be understood similarly to the passive needle whose mechanics has been thoroughly studied compared to the active one. Therefore, investigating the tip mechanics, including tissue properties, tip loadings, and tip kinematics, can lead to the complete understanding of active needle mechanics, the next challenges.},

In contemporary practice, digital information, such as CT scans, is predominantly used for presurgical verification. However, integrating patients digital 3D information into real-world environments through AR and MR allows dental professionals to visualize diagnostic and therapeutic data using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). This integration enhances not only efficiency and safety, but also elevates surgical training. Despite these benefits, further enhancements are required for these technologies to achieve broader acceptance in clinical dentistry. In this review, we have dedicated a separate section discussing the prospective applications and future directions of AR and MR, including optimizing HMD technology, developing intraoperative feedback navigation technology, advancing human-machine interaction (HMI) technology, and improving soft-tissue visualization technology. The literature suggests that AR and MR applications are particularly advantageous in dentistry, despite some limitations.

To investigate how sensor locations affect the ability to automatically detect compensatory movements of the upper limb, sixteen surface electromyography sensors were placed on key muscles involved in these movements. Thirty-one healthy participants performed a door-opening task in three conditions: without elbow restrictions (healthy pattern), and two conditions with limited elbow range of motion (60° of flexion-full flexion and 30°–80° of flexion to simulate injury). Statistical analyses identified sensor locations with significant differences between the conditions. Support vector machine classifiers demonstrated notably higher performance using data from six sensors on the middle deltoid, the upper trapezius, the latissimus dorsi, the external obliques, and the erector abdominis. This study highlights the importance of thoughtful muscle selection for effective automatic detection and correction of upper-limb compensatory movements, which is crucial for a wearable mechatronic device to be effective in improving the movement quality of patients.},

  abstract     = {Individuals who use upper limb prostheses receive limited feedback from their devices. Researchers have attempted to elicit sensation through direct stimulation of peripheral nerves or through stimulation of reinnervated skin or muscle. Previous research found that electrical stimulation of Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces (RPNIs) elicited sensations that were referred to the phantom hand. The purpose of this study was to determine if this sensation could be used to improve performance of a functional task. Two participants with upper limb loss completed the Box and Blocks Test in a virtual environment under four feedback conditions on a single day of testing. These conditions included no feedback, vibration triggered by object contact, and two conditions where RPNIs were electrically stimulated upon object contact. For the RPNI conditions, one was somatotopic, meaning the referred sensation and virtual sensor were collocated and the other was non-somatotopic, where the referred sensation and virtual sensor locations differed. Participants moved the most blocks when somatotopic feedback was provided. Both participants expressed a preference for the somatotopic sensation, noting that it made their movements feel more natural. Overall, this study demonstrates that RPNI-elicited sensation has the potential to improve functional performance.},

  abstract     = {In ankle-foot orthosis development, it is challenging to both specify the appropriate ankle mechanics and design systems that can physically render them. Recently, a new ankle-foot orthosis-the Variable Stiffness Orthosis (VSO)–was introduced to allow customization of the shape of the joint’s torque-angle relationship via a cam-based transmission. A module in the VSO permits switching between two coupled torque-angle relationships at desired kinematic transitions. This module decouples energy storage and return (DESR), enabling new functionality, including varying the ankle’s equilibrium position and exchanging energy between gait phases. However, the torque-angle relationships are defined by many parameters and subject to substantial constraints. We developed an optimization framework to design two versions of the DESR module to address foot drop. The angle module was designed to maximize swing ankle angle, and the energy module was designed to maximize energy recycled from early stance phase to augment push off. We validated the results of the optimization with brute-force searching and empirically tested the DESR mechanics in a rotary dynamometer. The angle module facilitated swing angles of up to 0.63° dorsiflexion, while simultaneously permitting a plantarflexed standing angle, and the energy module recycled up to 1.84 J.},

However, one of the biggest challenges of microrobots moving through the human body is represented by the complex 3D structure of biological lumina and tissues, which obstructs the navigation of micron-sized devices. Here, we fabricate ultra-deformable magnetic microrobots, consisting of ferrofluid-loaded lipid vesicles, and we magnetically pull them through chambers that exert upon them a gradually more forceful confinement. We thus analyze their capability to face interstices comparable to or smaller than their characteristic size and their consequent behavior in terms of stability, velocity, and deformation. The results show that the inherent compliance of these vesicle-based magnetic microrobots allows them to infiltrate successfully in interstices slightly smaller than their size. Further enhancement of their compliance and the development of specific control strategies may lead to microrobots able to move through interstices and traverse complex biological environments.},

This study explores the impact of kinematic constraints imposed by exoskeletons on user gait, stability, and perceived discomfort. Specifically, it examines how the varying degrees of freedom (DoF) in an ankle exoskeleton influence these factors. The exoskeleton utilized in this study can be configured to allow one, two, or three DoF, thereby simulating different levels of mechanical complexity and kinematic compatibility. A pilot study was conducted with six participants walking on a straight path to evaluate these effects. The findings indicate that increasing DoF of the exoskeleton improves several criteria, including kinematics and stability. In particular, the transition from 1 DoF to 2 DoF yielded a larger improvement than the transition from 2 DoF to 3 DoF, although the 3 DoF configuration produced the best overall results. Higher DoF configurations also resulted in stability values that resemble more closely those of walking without the exoskeleton, despite the added weight. Subjective feedback from participants corroborated these results, indicating the lowest discomfort with the 3 DoF ankle exoskeleton.},

  abstract     = {In telemanipulation, supplementary feedback can enhance operator perception and control precision. This study introduces a haptic interface designed to convey temporally discrete tactile cues when remotely controlling a robot. Low-profile piezoelectric sensors were integrated in the thumb of a robotic hand to capture the key events of the manipulation task (i.e., object contact and release). Synchronously with such events, pressure bursts were delivered to the operator’s fingertip through a soft textile thimble equipped with inflatable pockets. Both this haptic display and the sensing module were individually evaluated. The pneumatic system responsible for pockets inflation was characterized in terms of reaction time, proving suitable for the application with a latency of less than 70 ms. Regarding the sensing module, the behavior of the sensorized thumb was first evaluated under static conditions, identifying contact and release events when grasping with the robotic hand differently shaped objects fixed on a table. Then, the accuracy of the touch event detection was assessed while performing a more complex manipulation task (i.e., a pick and lift task). This evaluation was conducted first with the robot programmed to grasp and lift an object following pre-defined trajectories, where we measured accuracy of 100% for contact and 90% for release event detection. Then, we performed a telemanipulation pilot study involving eight participants, where the system proved capable of correctly detecting object contact and release events with an accuracy of 100% and 86.4%. Despite preliminary, these results confirmed proper functioning of the system and paved the way for the exploration of a new haptic feedback policy in telemanipulation based on temporally discrete tactile events.},

  abstract     = {Gait phase (GP) estimation is a critical component in control of exoskeletons and prostheses, enabling seamless user interaction in various controllers. In recent years, methods based on machine learning and sensor fusion have offered advances in GP estimation, but their high computational costs and reliance on training and numerous sensors present practical challenges. Estimation methods using phase variables, such as phase-portrait-based methods, can circumvent these drawbacks. However, their lower accuracy has limited their application. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization approach for improving the accuracy of GP estimation in phase-portrait-based methods. The approach is based on geometric manipulation of the phase portraits with linear transformations, which are adapted online by employing Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The performance of this adaptive method (termed AM) is compared against using a fixed transformation (FM) at different walking speeds on level and inclined treadmill. The results demonstrate the superior performance of AM in all tested conditions in terms of accuracy and linearity, with an average RMS error of $1.97 \pm 0.20\%$ . Convergence times for one round of optimization on a low-end single-board computer were less than 11 s on average. This study confirms the potential of leveraging HIL optimization for enhancing the performance of phase-portrait-based methods to reach accuracy levels comparable to more complex state-of-the-art methods.},

Repeated hand movements in physical therapy are shown to maintain flexibility and potentially facilitate regaining functionality. To further understand the impact of hand exoskeletons on motor impairment and recovery, we aim to study brain activation during rehabilitation and assistive hand exoskeleton use. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to measure brain activation with high spatial resolution, but devices used within a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine must be designed within several constraints. We present the design of a pneumatic hand orthosis with powered extension—the PneuHOPE Hand—a wearable MRI conditional research platform to enable the studying of brain activation in the presence of hand spasticity. To demonstrate its use as an MRI compatible platform, we conducted MRI conditionality testing. Additionally, we collected brain activation data from two healthy control subject’s using fMRI to show that the exoskeleton can be comfortably worn in the MRI scanner and that appropriate brain activation data can be collected during use. The results indicate the PneuHOPE Hand platform can be safely used for neuroimaging studies in the MRI with &lt; 12% reduction in SNR for T1 images, &lt; 32% reduction for T2, and no visible paramagnetic artifacts.},

In this paper, a large deploy/fold ratio variable stiffness hyper-redundant robot based on the origami principle is proposed, which has a large deploy/fold ratio, and realizes large stiffness change based on the bionic muscle-driven variable stiffness principle. Based on the analysis of origami theory, the robot uses rigid origami mechanisms as the skeleton support, flexible gasbags as the backbones, and the hybrid actuation is used to realize the extension, contraction, variable stiffness, and omnidirectional bending motion. Based on the motion/stiffness model of the hyper-redundant robot, the characteristics of the single-joint and the 6-joint hyper-redundant robot are verified by experiments. These experiments confirm that the hyper-redundant robot has a large deploy/fold and variable stiffness range, obtains a large bending deformation and working range, can overcome the gravity generated by itself and the load, and has a high load capacity.},

Recent tracking techniques achieved high-bandwidth detection considering a simplified model for the magnetic sources, i.e., the dipole model. Nonetheless, such a model can lead to inaccurate results any time a non-spherical magnet approaches the sensor array. Here, we present a novel tracking algorithm based on an analytical model for permanent magnet cylinders with uniform arbitrary magnetization. By means of a physical system mounting 20 magnetometers, we compared the tracking accuracy obtained with our algorithm vs. results obtained by using the dipole model and with respect to a ground-truth reference. With a single magnetic target, our algorithm can significantly lower position (up to 0.68 mm) and orientation errors (up to 2.5°) while enabling online tracking (computation time below 19 ms). We also accurately tracked two magnets, by obtaining a reduction in position error (up to 0.92 mm) vs. the dipole-based algorithm. These findings broaden the applicability of accurate magnetic tracking to real-time applications, facilitating the tracking of multiple magnetic targets in proximity of the magnetic sensors. This advancement opens avenues for applications in wearable devices, advancing the field of motion detection beyond traditional inertial measurement units.},

  abstract     = {Hemiparetic gait is often characterized by ankle weakness, resulting in decreased propulsion and clearance, as well as knee hyperextension. These gait deviations reduce speed and efficiency while increasing the risk of falls and osteoarthritis. Powered ankle exoskeletons have the potential to address these issues. However, only a handful of studies have investigated their effects on hemiparetic gait. The results are often inconsistent, and the biomechanical analysis rarely includes the knee or hip joint or a direct clearance measure. In this case study, we assess the ankle, knee, and hip biomechanics with and without a new autonomous powered ankle exoskeleton across different speeds and inclines. Exoskeleton assistance resulted in more normative kinematics at the subject’s self-selected walking speed. The paretic ankle angle at heel strike increased from 10° plantarflexed without the exoskeleton to 0.5° dorsiflexed with the exoskeleton, and the peak plantarflexion angle during swing decreased from 28° without the exoskeleton to 12° with the exoskeleton. Furthermore, stance knee flexion increased from 7° without the exoskeleton to 20° with the exoskeleton. Finally, foot clearance increased with the exoskeleton for all conditions between 3.1 cm and 5.4 cm. This case study highlights new mechanisms for powered ankle exoskeletons to improve hemiparetic gait.},

  abstract     = {Medical robotics can help improve the reach of healthcare services. A challenge for medical robots is their complex physical interaction. This work evaluates a recently introduced control architecture based on Fractal Impedance Control (FIC) in medical applications. The deployed FIC architecture is robust to delay between the master and the replica robots and can switch online between an admittance and impedance behavior. Our experiments analyze three scenarios: teleoperated surgery, rehabilitation, and remote ultrasound scan. The experiments did not require any adjustment of the robot tuning, which is essential in medical applications where the operators do not have an engineering background. Our results show that it is possible to teleoperate the robot to perform remote occupational therapy, operate a scalpel, and use an ultrasound scan. However, our experiments also highlighted the need for a better robot embodiment to control the system precisely in 3D dynamic tasks.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, considerable steps have been made in designing wearable assistive devices that reduce the metabolic cost of walking. As the field continues to advance, a growing emphasis is extending to human running, driven by the goal of improving efficiency and reducing metabolic strain. In our study, we developed a portable active exosuit to support hip extension during endurance running. The exosuit, featuring custom linear actuators and a control system synchronous with the wearer’s kinematics, initially underwent bench testing and, finally, a field evaluation with users running at their self-selected pace on an athletics track. Results from seven participants showed a significant reduction in the metabolic cost of transport when the exosuit was active. Specifically, we observed a 9.6% decrease with respect to the unpowered condition, with a 4.3% net saving compared to not wearing the device. Additionally, kinematic assessments revealed no alteration of the participants’ motion after toe-off, indicating transparency to physiological movement pattern during hip flexion. These findings highlight the potential of the exosuit to enhance athletic performance, opening new possibilities for running assistance in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Wearable robotic devices like exosuits address mobility challenges in musculoskeletal disorders. While exoskeletons mainly aid in rehabilitation routines, lightweight exosuits provide a cost-effective solution, empowering individuals with motor disabilities in performing daily activities. Characterized by discreet, flexible designs, exosuits seamlessly integrate into daily routines, offering unobtrusive support and enhancing functional independence for those with mobility impairments. This research proposes a novel exoglove controlled via force-myography to restore grasping motor ability in individuals with partial loss of hand-motor function but retaining residual wrist movement. The exosuit aims to provide a tailored solution, offering cost-effective advantages over traditional exoskeletons. The proposed exoglove uses force myography to translate the user’s wrist movements into a motor command to assist grasping. Such an approach could ensure reliable and consistent control for people with partial or total loss of finger motion. With more than 89% accuracy in wrist movement classification, it can operate with minimal effort, moreover, the exoglove preserves natural finger motion, demonstrated by negligible muscle activity variations.},

  abstract     = {In the control of lower-limb exoskeletons with feet, the phase in the gait cycle can be identified by monitoring the weight distribution at the feet. This phase information can be used in the exoskeleton’s controller to compensate the dynamics of the exoskeleton and to assign impedance parameters. Typically the weight distribution is calculated using data from sensors such as treadmill force plates or insole force sensors. However, these solutions increase both the setup complexity and cost. For this reason, we propose a deep-learning approach that uses a short time window of joint kinematics to predict the weight distribution of an exoskeleton in real time. The model was trained on treadmill walking data from six users wearing a four-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton and tested in real time on three different users wearing the same device. This test set includes two users not present in the training set to demonstrate the model’s ability to generalize across individuals. Results show that the proposed method is able to fit the actual weight distribution with $R^{2}=0.9$ and is suitable for real-time control with prediction times less than 1 ms. Experiments in closed-loop exoskeleton control show that deep-learning-based weight distribution estimation can be used to replace force sensors in overground and treadmill walking.},

  abstract     = {Electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal models (EMS) of the trunk are used for estimating lumbosacral joint moments and compressive loads during lifting tasks. These models provide personalized estimates of the parameters using information from many sensors. However, to advance technology from labs to workplaces, there is a need for sensor reduction to improve wearability and applicability. Therefore we introduce an EMG sensor reduction approach based on inverse synergy extrapolation, to reconstruct unmeasured EMG signals for different box-lifting techniques. 12 participants performed an array of tasks (squat, stoop, unilateral twist and bilateral twist) with different weights (0 kg, 7.5 kg and 15 kg). We found that two synergies were sufficient to explain the different lifting tasks (median variance accounted for of 0.91). Building upon this, we used two sensors at optimal subject-specific muscle locations to reconstruct the EMG of four unmeasured channels. Evaluation of the reconstructed and reference EMG showed median coefficients of determination $(R^{2})$ between 0.70 and 0.86, with median root mean squared errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.02 to 0.04 relative to maximal voluntary contraction. This indicates that our proposed method shows promise for sensor reduction for driving a trunk EMS for ambulatory biomechanical risk assessment in occupational settings and exoskeleton control.},

  abstract     = {Humans frequently interact with objects that have dynamic complexity, like a cup of coffee. Such systems are nonlinear and underactuated, potentially creating unstable dynamics. Instabilities generate complex interaction forces that render the system unpredictable. And yet, humans interact with these objects with ease. Nonlinear dynamic analysis shows that the initial conditions and frequencies of input forces determine the system’s stability. Taking inspiration from carrying a cup of coffee, participants rhythmically moved a cup with a ball rolling inside which was modeled as a cart-pendulum system. They were encouraged to prepare the cup-and-ball system by ‘jiggling’ the cup before moving it back and forth on a horizontal line. We tested the hypothesis that humans initialize the system and choose interaction frequencies that stabilize their interactions. To create uncertainty about the specific cup-and-ball system, the pendulum length was varied without providing cues to the participant. Stability was quantified by variability of relative phase between cup and ball. Results showed that participants nonlinearly co-varied the initial ball angle at the end of preparation and the cup frequency during the rhythmic phase. Mapping participants’ choices onto the highly nonlinear manifold of stable solutions generated by forward-simulations verified that they indeed achieved stable solutions.},
