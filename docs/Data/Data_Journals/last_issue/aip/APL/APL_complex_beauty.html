  abstract     = {Anisotropy plays a crucial role in understanding and optimizing the properties of materials with directional dependencies. The hexagonal wurtzite structure, which is a typical crystal structure in compound semiconductors, demonstrates pronounced anisotropy, especially in its response to external stimuli. Recently, mechanical behavior under light illumination has attracted increasing interest especially in semiconductor compounds. In this study, we investigated the anisotropy of illumination effects on the nanomechanical properties of wurtzite ZnO. Four surface orientations—(0001), (0001) 45° off, ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ), and ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ )—were subjected to nanoindentation creep and nanoindentation hardness tests under controlled light illumination. The indentation depth during nanoindentation creep under light illumination was consistently smaller than that in darkness for all surface orientations, confirming that light suppresses indentation creep deformation, but to different degrees depending on the surface orientation. This suggests that the activated slip systems and the distribution of dislocations play a crucial role in modulating dislocation behavior under light illumination. The nanoindentation hardness followed the trend on the four surface orientations: (0001) &gt; (0001) 45° off &gt; ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ) &gt; ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ ), reflecting anisotropic behavior in nanomechanical properties. Second and subsequent pop-in events were extracted, exhibiting different behaviors depending on the surface orientations, and may play a key role in determining the anisotropy in nanoindentation hardness. Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the plastic anisotropy under light control in wurtzite ZnO.},

  abstract     = {Passive solar heating and radiative cooling attracted lots of attention in global energy consumption reduction due to their unique electricity-free advantage. However, static single radiation cooling or solar heating would lead to over-cooling or over-heating in cold or hot weather, respectively. How to achieve effective self-adaptive thermoregulation is critical for dynamic thermal management. Hence, in this work, a self-adaptive thermoregulation strategy was designed by coupling latent heat storage or release with reversible solar heating and radiative cooling. A commercial memory alloy could realize self-adaptive thermoregulation at the critical temperature between radiative cooling with high solar reflectance R ¯ solar = 0.95 and thermal emittance ε ¯ LWIR = 0.93, and solar heating with high solar absorptance α ¯ solar = 0.92 and low thermal emittance ε ¯ IR = 0.08. High thermal conductive phase change material could further improve the thermoregulation performance with a latent heat of ∼136 J g −1 , and thermal conductivity of 3.4 W m −1 K −1 , resulting in a superior heating performance than the single solar heating (39.9 vs 36.9 °C) and superior cooling performance than the single radiative cooling (33.8 vs 35.5 °C). The maximum heating temperature increase could be 12.7 °C in the cold situation, and the temperature drop could be 8.3 °C in the hot situation. Energy consumption calculation showed that the designed sample could save 68%–90% of annual energy consumption compared with the common roof, indicating that coupling spectral regulation with the latent heat can greatly improve the self-adaptive thermoregulation performance and save the total energy consumption in thermal management.},

  abstract     = {The lack of low-work function materials and the negative space charge effect have long prevented vacuum thermionic energy converters (VTECs) from becoming a practical means of power generation. Advancements in microfabrication have since provided solutions to these challenges, such as the suppression of negative space charge via a micro/nanoscale interelectrode vacuum gap distance, reigniting interest in VTECs as a potential clean energy technology. However, the limited operational lifetimes of many low-work function coatings have hindered their practical device-level implementation. Solid-state thermionic energy converters (SSTECs) have been proposed as a viable alternative to VTECs since they do not require an interelectrode vacuum gap or low-work function electrodes. Nevertheless, SSTECs still require a large temperature gradient between electrodes and are limited to low operating voltages. To address these limitations, we propose a near-field enhanced solid-state thermionic energy converter (NF-SSTEC), which leverages the advantages of SSTECs by eliminating the need for a large temperature gradient between the electrodes and increasing the range of possible operating voltages. We theoretically demonstrate conversion efficiencies of 16.8 % and power densities as high as 13.1 W cm −2 without needing a high-temperature gradient between the radiator and SSTEC. Additionally, we compare its performance under different radiation spectra, showing the potential for improvement via further optimization of the radiator.},

Here, we proposed a self-aligned plasmonic-nanofluidic device, in which both nanochannel and plasmonic nanostructures are readily fabricated and self-aligned by using only one step of direct laser writing. Specifically, we use a single gold subwavelength nanochannel to simultaneously apply both spatial confinement and plasmonic enhancement. Furthermore, instead of using an ultrafast laser, we demonstrate the feasibility of drilling nanochannels on suspended substrate using continuous lasers. In contrast to conventional plasmonic nanochannels with plasmonic enhancement only under transverse magnetic (TM) mode laser, our sample presents obvious plasmonic effects under both TM and transverse electric mode lasers, which is beneficial for improving the overall signal. Our method has great potential in the widespread adoption of the plasmonic-nanofluidic system.},

This study explored the vibration of buckled graphite sheets under external excitation using experimental analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and nonlinear isotropic plate model (NIPM). Notably, multiple peaks corresponding to the identical mode appeared in the spectrum. The additional peak distinct from the natural frequency arose from transition between two steady states of the film. Remarkably, the frequency of the peak corresponding to the transition exhibited greater sensitivity to external excitations and stress than the natural frequency of the resonator did. This phenomenon opens avenues for developing 2D resonant nanomechanical sensors with enhanced sensitivity, as well as bistable nanoelectromechanical resonators.},

  abstract     = {Bulk CsPbBr 3 is an emerging semiconductor that has shown unprecedented increase in performance over the last decade for optoelectronic applications. However, further development of devices based on CsPbBr 3 is hampered by their poor electrical stability under operation. Migration and accumulation of native ions (Cs + , Pb 2+ , and Br - ) under electric fields has been suggested by many groups to be responsible for the observed device instabilities, although direct experimental evidence of ionic motion during operation has been seldom reported. In our study, ion migration has been probed by grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) in CsPbBr 3 polycrystalline layers grown in vapor phase. Our findings indicate that both Cs and Br experience ionic migration under electric field, suggesting that these ions are responsible for the measured current instability in our devices. In the timescale of a few hours, the ionic drifting rates of mobile Cs and Br under the top electrode were found to be similar, as high as ∼ 20 ppm h −1 V −1 mm.

In the literature, the presence or absence of the TIBB effect in a given STS measurement is often not discussed thoroughly. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the TIBB effect in MoS 2 with varying thicknesses using light-modulated contact-mode STS. Our results demonstrate that the TIBB effect is strongly dependent on the thickness of MoS 2 . With thin MoS 2 of a few atomic layers (several nanometers), the TIBB approaches zero, and the measured STS can accurately reflect the band edges. While for thicker MoS 2 of ∼100 nm, the TIBB can be as large as ∼1 eV. This work clarifies the ambiguity about the TIBB effect and provides a foundation for the interpretation of STS data on atomically thin semiconductors.},

The results indicate that sliding the upper layer of the bilayer induces charge transfer, causing polarization accompanied by periodic changes and reversal in non-polarized β -GaSe. Simultaneously, low-frequency optical phonons in polarized structures soften significantly, exhibiting a minimum or rapid decrease accompanied by the maximum value of in-plane polarization. Additionally, the sliding symmetry breaking has complex effects on phonon transport, causing intriguing changes in transport characteristics due to variations in group velocity and linewidth, which are closely related to ferroelectric polarization. This study reveals not only the polarization achieved in the β -GaSe bilayer through sliding-induced symmetry breaking but also its complex effects on phonons and profound physical changes, enriching our understanding of the associated condensed matter physics.},

However, the difference in charge between O 2− and F − anions makes the Ti 3+ arise in BTOT ceramics. The coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism was observed in BTOF ceramics at room temperature by P–E loop and M–H loop. Moreover, these two ferroic orders originate from the Ti atoms. This work presents an alternative scheme for exploring multiferroic materials with large polarization and magnetization at room temperature, and we also expect preferable magnetoelectric coupling.},

Epitaxial high-K barrier AlBN/GaN HEMTs can thus extend performance beyond the capabilities of current GaN transistors.},

The dispersion relationships between the resonant frequencies and wavelengths for the resonators, including the shear horizontal (SH) and Rayleigh modes, are investigated. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the main SH mode provides a larger coupling coefficient ( K 2 ) and that the spurious Rayleigh mode can be shifted from the passband and away from the main SH mode. Although the proposed POI SAW resonators on two different substrates have comparable frequencies for the same wavelength, the sapphire-based substrate exhibits a larger K 2 of 28% and a higher fitted Bode- Q max of 977 at 1.4 GHz. The temperature behavior of the SAW resonators is measured over a temperature range from −25 to 250 °C. The findings indicated that the resonator with the Si-based substrate has better temperature stability, with a temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of −16.99 ppm/°C and a turning point at 150 °C. In contrast, the one with the sapphire-based substrate provides a moderate TCF of −22.15 ppm/°C and remains linear for temperatures above 200 °C. This study reveals the impact of different substrate structures on the performance of SAW resonators, providing guidance for the design of desired SAW devices and their applications.},

Applying localized forces to the surface of ferroelectric materials using scanning probes can generate strain gradients that induce domain reconfigurations. In this study, we present an alternative approach to flexoelectric-induced domain engineering in suspended two-dimensional CuInP 2 S 6 (CIPS) membranes by varying the ambient pressure. By capping CIPS over cavity holes, internal air pressurization induces bulging, which results in unique encircled domain configurations governed by local strain gradients showing upward and downward polarizations at the center and the edge of the suspended membrane, respectively. Furthermore, this domain configuration can be bidirectionally modulated by varying the ambient pressure. We demonstrate reversible variations in domain size, driven by topographic changes that redistribute the strain gradient. Our findings demonstrate that ambient pressure can be used to engineer domains in suspended ferroelectric membranes, opening avenues for the development of emerging ferroelectric devices that are sensitive to ambient pressure.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the avalanche dynamics of ferroelectric domain switching in barium titanate single crystals across a range of temperatures using acoustic emission techniques. Ferroelectric domain switching induced by an electric field exhibits scale-invariant avalanche dynamics, with the energy exponent increasing from 1.63 ± 0.067 at room temperature to 1.92 ± 0.045 near the Curie point, before decreasing at higher temperatures. This peak in the exponent is attributed to the interplay between equilibrium critical fluctuations and avalanche criticality. As the temperature approaches the Curie point, smaller domains and reduced polarization promote lower-energy switching, increasing the energy exponent. Near the Curie temperature, equilibrium fluctuations further modify the energy landscape, likely generating more phase boundaries and amplifying the energy exponent. Above the Curie temperature, electric field-induced phase transition dominates the switching process, where the higher energy barrier hinders switching, resulting in more energetic events and a lower energy exponent. Across all temperatures, waiting time distributions exhibit double power-law behavior, with exponents of −1 ± 0.05 for short times and −2 ± 0.10 for long times, while aftershock activity follows Omori&#39;s law with an exponent close to −1, indicating robust temporal correlations in ferroelectric domain switching. This study underscores that the avalanche dynamics of ferroelectric domain switching can be effectively modulated by temperature.},

By employing floating-zone synthesis with proper heat-treatment process, we systematically tune oxygen vacancies and reveal their dual effect: oxygen vacancies enhance the pyroelectric figure-of-merit, while removing oxygen vacancies extends the effective lifetime in one-charge pyroelectric energy conversion. We discover that the phase transition in a heat-treated single crystal SBN60 device helps achieve stable electricity generation for approximately 7000 cycles in 30 h with enhanced functional reversibility. The dual effect of oxygen vacancies on the coupling of pyroelectricity and effective lifetime provides a useful strategy to design high-performance pyroelectric materials, especially for one-charge pyroelectric energy conversion, offering a practical solution for real-world applications of pyroelectric devices.},

  abstract     = {Nb 2 GeTe 4 , a two-dimensional ferroelastic semiconductor, has garnered intense research interest due to its nontrivial physicochemical characteristics of high carrier mobility as well as extraordinary ferroelasticity and optical absorbance along with potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this work, the high-pressure structural, vibrational, and electrical transport properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 up to 60.0 GPa under different hydrostatic environments were systematically studied by Raman spectroscopy, electrical conductivity, and first-principles theoretical calculations. Under non-hydrostatic compression, Nb 2 GeTe 4 experienced a metallization at 11.8 GPa originating from the closure of bandgap due to the considerable compression of interlayer distance and sequential an isostructural phase transition (IPT) at 26.5 GPa. The comparable metallization pressure and the pronounced delay of IPT by ∼4.0 GPa under hydrostatic condition can be reasonably interpreted by the influence of deviatoric stress. Upon decompression, the phase transition of Nb 2 GeTe 4 was demonstrated to be reversible with the possible structural destruction under different hydrostatic environments. Moreover, Nb 2 GeTe 4 underwent a Ohmic-to-super-Ohmic conversion at 1000 mV under high pressure, which was presumably caused by the higher sinusoidal voltage than its thermal voltage. These findings enrich our foundational comprehension on high-pressure physicochemical properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 , thereby fostering its potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

Producing such large format devices requires the use of a high throughput lithography process such as stepper photolithography. This restricts nanowire widths to the resolution limit of the photolithography system, which limits performance, particularly for mid-infrared wavelengths. In this paper, we develop an SNSPD fabrication process that uses bidirectional atomic layer etching to reduce nanowire widths by &gt; 100 nm, achieving performance that has only previously been attained using low throughput electron beam lithography. This fabrication process will allow for high-pixel count SNSPD cameras with improved performance due to reduced nanowire widths.},

In this study, we investigate the laser-induced ultrafast spin injection from permalloy (Py) into the RE metal holmium (Ho), modulated by interfacial engineering and varying the external magnetic field strength. The antiferromagnetically coupled interface between Py and Ho is confirmed by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and its correlation with spin dynamic damping is revealed by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. More importantly, we demonstrate the effective modulation of spin transmission through an external magnetic field. At the Py/Ho interface, a substantial spin-mixing conductance (SMC) of approximately 7.71 × 10 15 cm −2 is observed, which can be modulated by approximately 35% under an external magnetic field. The applied high magnetic fields are found to suppress the large SMC, primarily due to the modified sperimagnetic structure at the Py/Ho interface.

  abstract     = {Diamond and graphene, which have extremely high thermal conductivity, are considered ideal candidates for the preparation of high-performance thermal interface materials (TIMs). However, the development of flexible TIMs with efficient heat transfer paths still hampers their thermal management applications. Herein, a highly oriented diamond–graphene composite film (DGCF) was prepared by one-step microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition on carbon cloth (CC) using N-butylamine as a single liquid carbon source. The hybridized composition of sp 3 /sp 2 and the heat transfer path length of DGCF are regulated by the deposition temperature and the thermal conductivity of CC/DGCF at 30 °C is 2.71 W m −1 K −1 , which is 15 times higher than that of CC. Further flexible TIMs of CC/DGCF are achieved using thermal silicone grease (TG) as filler, and the thermal conductivity of the final flexible compound of CC/DGCF/TG is 6.97 W m −1 K −1 at 30 °C, which is 39 times higher than that of pure CC and 2 times higher than that of TG, respectively. In the actual TIMs performance test, the cooling efficiency is 1.4 times higher than that of the commercial thermal conductive silicone pad. Furthermore, finite element simulations demonstrated that the film at 800 °C has the optimal sp 3 /sp 2 ratio for thermal response and the best thermal conductivity path structure. This finding provides a method for the design of highly flexible TIMs and increases the possibility of their practical application in electronic thermal management.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional gallium nitride (2D-GaN) has great potential in power electronics and optoelectronics. Heat dissipation is a critical issue for these applications of 2D-GaN. Previous studies have shown that higher-order phonon–phonon scattering has extremely strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ lat ⁠ ) of 2D-GaN, with the fourth-order interatomic force constants (4th-IFCs) calculated using experienced atomic displacement in the finite difference method. In this work, it is found that the 4th-IFCs of 2D-GaN are quite sensitive to atomic displacement in the finite difference method. The effects of the four-phonon scattering can be severely overestimated with non-convergent 4th-IFCs. The κ lat from three-phonon scattering is reduced by 65.6% due to four-phonon scattering. The reflection symmetry allows significantly more four-phonon processes than three-phonon processes. It was previously thought the electron–phonon interactions have significant effects on the κ lat of two-dimensional materials. However, the effects of electron–phonon interactions on the κ lat of both n -type and p -type 2D-GaN at high charge carrier concentrations can be neglected due to the few phonon–electron scattering channels and the relatively strong four-phonon scattering.},

Our investigation examines the lattice constants and electronic energy bandgaps of both the superlattice structures and alloys across different Al concentrations, shedding light on the intricate relationship between composition and electronic properties. The analysis on electronic properties reveals that as the number of Al 2 O 3 monolayers in the Al 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 superlattice rises from 2 to 6 monolayers, the bandgap correspondingly expands from 5.29 to 6.43 eV. The band alignment between monoclinic Al 2 O 3 and Ga 2 O 3 exhibits a type-II band alignment. The conduction and valence band offsets between the bulk material and Al 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 superlattice varies with change in the number of Al 2 O 3 monolayers.

Here, we probe the pressure-induced B4–B1 phase transition of some typical semiconductors (ZnO, GaN, AlN, and LiGaO 2 ) at low temperatures (90–300 K) using a self-designed isothermal compression in situ Raman spectroscopy technique. We experimentally determine their B4–B1 phase boundaries at low temperature and obtain the corresponding negative Clapeyron slope parameters, with steeper slopes corresponding to larger entropy changes.

In this work, both the ultra-broadband transient absorption spectra and carrier recombination time in GaN were found to be significantly altered by carbon defects. An energy band model for carbon defect dynamics was established based on transient absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Our model discernibly reveals that C N and tri-carbon in GaN intricately modulate both the absorption spectrum and carrier capture process: The rapid capture of holes by the C N defect significantly reduces the hole recombination time to hundreds of femtoseconds in the near-infrared band. Conversely, the tri-carbon defect exhibited a higher absorption cross section by an order of magnitude than that of free carrier in the visible region with a long carrier recombination time. This work clarifies the modulation mechanisms of complex carbon defects in GaN&#39;s nonlinear absorption and provides scientific guidance for designing broadband and integrated ultrafast optical nonlinear devices.},

Typically, heterovalent impurities, or dopants, are added to semiconducting QDs to provide extra electrons and improve conductivity. Since each QD is expected to contain a few dopants, the extra electrons and their parent dopants have been difficult to locate. In this work, we investigate the spatial distribution of the extra electrons and their parent donors in epitaxial InAs/GaAs QDs using local-electrode atom-probe tomography and self-consistent Schrödinger–Poisson simulations in the effective mass approximation. Although dopants are provided in both layers, the ionized donors primarily reside outside of the QDs, providing extra electrons that are contained within the QDs. Indeed, due to the quantum confinement-induced enhancement of the donor ionization energy within the QDs, a lower fraction of dopants within the QDs are ionized. These findings suggest a pathway toward the development of 3D modulation-doped nanostructures.},

A comparative investigation on the structural and electrical properties of N-implanted β -Ga 2 O 3 was conducted under different implantation temperatures and post-implantation annealing (PIA) conditions. The results showed that the high-temperature implantation (HTI) at 500 °C, compared to the room-temperature implantation (RTI), introduced fewer structural defects and less lattice distortion to β -Ga 2 O 3 . The HTI-formed CBL demonstrated a far superior current-blocking capability than those formed by the RTI with/without a PIA, in terms of a much lower and more stable leakage current and a significantly enhanced breakdown voltage. Additionally, lateral MOSFETs fabricated with the HTI isolation exhibited a three orders of magnitude lower off-state leakage current while maintaining excellent on-state performance, compared to those using the isolation formed by RTI with PIA. These findings indicate that the in situ dynamic annealing effect of HTI effectively reduces implantation-induced damage, enhances impurity activation, and improves the overall performance of the N-implanted CBLs in β -Ga 2 O 3 .},

  abstract     = {The GaN family as an electronic material and AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as electronic devices have found their widespread usage in power electronics and radio frequency (RF) applications. The threshold voltage is a crucial parameter, and application-specific threshold voltage is a requirement for this technology. A large positive threshold voltage with enhancement-mode operation is useful for power electronics. A depletion-mode transistor is used for radio frequency (RF) applications where the electron mobility is much larger in the channel region due to low interface roughness. A multi-threshold voltage transistor is a desired feature to reduce nonlinearity through compensation in RF applications. We address the issue with threshold voltage by demonstrating a programmable threshold AlGaN/GaN transistor using a dielectric stack as the charge-trapping layer. We have fabricated and characterized a triple-layer dielectric gate stack for AlGaN/GaN metal–insulator–semiconductor HEMTs. The gate stack comprises a high-k tantalum oxide sandwiched between two aluminum oxide layers. The structure is analogous to the polysilicon–aluminum oxide–nitride–oxide–silicon memory used in silicon technology. In addition to providing a large programmable threshold voltage window, the fabricated diodes reduce the gate leakage current by more than four orders of magnitude. The experimental observations are explained by the band edge alignment of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure with the dielectric stack and using a charge-trapping process by a high positive program voltage.},

This CCW phenomenon is due to the dipole formation between the a-In 2 O 3 channel and the SiO X gate insulator by relocating oxygen atoms under the influence of the applied electric field. Hence, bipolar switching of gate bias (V GS ) alters the dipole direction and leads to low (V TL ) and high (V TH ) threshold voltages. The dipole formation increases with the electric field, which can be tailored by gate oxide (SiO X ) thickness or gate bias (V GS ). Therefore, the devices with a gate oxide thickness of 200 nm initially showed the clockwise hysteresis at V GS of 2 V, transformed to the CCW (MW of 4.2 V) with an increase in gate bias to 14 V. Therefore, a difference in oxygen density at the interface can form a dipole to exhibit the CCW phenomenon and behave FeFET-like.},

The cone-shaped domains, which emerge from shallow pits generated in AlN and propagate through the superlattices, are shown to exhibit small misorientation angles of their crystalline 〈0001〉 poles. The results of the atom probe tomography analysis are confirmed by convergent beam electron diffraction measurements.

  abstract     = {Dual-main-phase (DMP) magnets, a promising approach for the efficient utilization of high-abundance rare earth elements, exhibit enhanced coercivity compared to single-main-phase (SMP) magnets. This study demonstrates that a DMP magnet exhibits a 43 kA/m coercivity increase over an SMP magnet of equivalent composition. Microstructural characterization reveals two main-phase grains with distinct core–shell structures in the DMP magnet. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the increased Nd content enhances the anisotropy field of the shells in Ce-rich grains, crucially contributing to the coercivity enhancement. Conversely, Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains do not significantly enhance coercivity. A micromagnetic model, constructed by substituting Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains with (Nd 0.5 Ce 0.5 ) 2 Fe 14 B grains, demonstrates a slight coercivity increase compared to the DMP magnets. Moreover, retaining only the core–shell structure in grains near the end faces maintains higher coercivity than that of DMP magnets. Experimental results of DyCoCu grain boundary diffusion show a 406 kA/m coercivity increase in the DMP magnet, less than the 510 kA/m increase in the diffused SMP magnet. Although diffusion significantly increases the anisotropy field in the shell, the core region of the Ce-rich grains maintains a low anisotropy field, limiting magnetic property enhancement. These findings underscore the critical role of an optimized core–shell structure in enhancing coercivity for Ce-rich magnets, suggesting that the DMP method may not represent the most effective strategy.},

However, the dimensional stability of those composites is not guaranteed due to the residual stress generated during fabrication and the microstructure instability of the matrix. Here, we studied the effects of heat treatments on the dimensional stability of ZTE Cu 2 P 2 O 7 /ZL101 composite (with 32 vol. % of ZL101) prepared using the pressure infiltration method. Compared with the as-cast case, after a certain heat treatment (water quenching after holding at 773 K for 1 h, then aging at 463 K for 8 h, and finally thermal-cold cycling between 463 and 77 K for three times), the dimensional stability was improved by a factor of 20 and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was highly reproducible in the subsequent temperature cycles test. The treated composite exhibits a CTE of −0.028 ppm/K at 240–305 K and a relatively high thermal conductivity of 29.5 W m −1 K −1 at room temperature, leading to a thermal distortion parameter well less than those of other ZTE materials. The improved dimensional stability and the CTE reproducibility can be attributed to the stabilization of matrix microstructure and the greatly relaxed residual stress as revealed by the analysis of 2θ-sin 2 ψ based on x-ray diffraction.},

In this work, we propose a three-dimensional carbon allotrope by interpenetrating α -graphyne sheets with van der Waals interactions and study its structural and electronic properties by first-principles calculations and tight-binding methods. Our calculations show that the energy of this interpenetrated α -graphyne is slightly lower than that of the α -graphyne nanosheet due to the weak van der Waals interactions, and its dynamical and thermodynamical stabilities are further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Remarkably, 3D interpenetrated α -graphyne is a semimetal with both Dirac nodal loops and triply degenerate nodal points near the Fermi level and the Fermi velocities at these nodal points are very high. These properties are superior to 2D α -graphyne and ordinary 3D carbon materials. Our work not only proposes a type of 3D carbon material with multiple types of fermions for carbon-based high-speed nanoelectronic devices but also shows that interpenetrating 2D materials with large hollows is a promising method for constructing 3D materials.},

A combination of HVPE and AlN substrate enabled decreasing deleterious carbon concentration and dislocation density, respectively, thus accentuating the influences of V Al -complexes on the luminescence processes. A low-temperature CL spectrum of unintentionally doped AlN exhibited predominant excitonic emissions at around 6 eV and a marginal deep-state emission band at around 3.7 eV that originates from residual carbon (&lt;10 16 cm −3 ) on nitrogen sites ( ⁠ C N ⁠ ). However, the sample was revealed to contain a considerable amount ( ⁠ ∼ 10 17 cm − 3 ⁠ ) of vacancy clusters, most likely comprising a V Al and nitrogen-vacancies ( ⁠ V N ⁠ ), namely, V Al V N 1 − 2 ⁠ , which act as nonradiative recombination centers that decrease overall CL intensity at elevated temperatures. With increasing Si-doping concentration ([Si]), major vacancy species progressively changed from V Al V N 1 − 2 to V Al O N 1 − 2 ⁠ , where O N is oxygen on N sites, which exhibit other deep-state emission bands ranging from 3.2 to 3.5 eV. Further increase in [Si] gave rise to the formation of donor-compensating defects comprising V Al and Si on the second-nearest-neighbor Al sites ( ⁠ Si Al ⁠ ), abbreviated by V Al − Si Al n ⁠ , which exhibit emission shoulders at around 2.9–3.0 eV. When [Si] exceeded 5 × 10 18 cm −3 , an emission band at around 4.5 eV emerged, which had been ascribed to originate from the nearest-neighbor Si Al C N complexes. Because V Al -complexes, including those containing impurities, are thermally stable, incorporation of vacancies should be blocked at the growth stage.},

Antimony selenide is well known for its thermoelectric properties. However, the on-surface synthesis of chain-like structures with varying stoichiometries remains challenging. In this study, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to investigate the epitaxial growth of SbSe chain structures. With increasing deposition of Sb and Se, a transition is observed in both the structural and electronic properties, shifting from semiconducting mixed chains to metallic uniform tri-chains. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the elemental composition and helps determine the stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations show that the mixed-chain phase is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.17 eV, and that spin–orbit coupling induces band splitting. In contrast, the tri-chain phase, formed by weak van der Waals interactions between chains within the unit cell, undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal transition due to strong hybridization near the Fermi level. These findings not only provide a strategy for tuning the electronic properties of one-dimensional materials but also provide valuable insights for the design of thermoelectric and quantum materials, with potential applications in next-generation electronic devices.},

It was found that cubic CoSbS exhibits a higher solid solubility of Ni at the Co site compared to the orthorhombic sample. The high-density point defect Ni Co in cubic CoSbS results in enhanced phonon scattering, thereby sharply suppressing phonon thermal conductivity. First-principles calculations show that the cubic structure of CoSbS exhibits higher band degeneracy and greater band dispersion compared to the orthorhombic structure, resulting in superior electrical transport properties. As a result, an enhanced figure of merit zT ∼ 0.37 was obtained at 773 K for cubic Ni 0.1 Co 0.9 SbS, which is approximately 16% higher than that of the orthorhombic sample prepared by the same method.

The current technology is constrained by its reliance on complex control mechanisms and a narrow control scope, which collectively impede its practical deployment. In this Letter, we introduce an all-season smart film, a multilayer film composed of In 3 SbTe 2 (IST), CaF 2 , and ZnS on an Al substrate, which possesses the unique ability to synergistically modulate solar-thermal radiation. The solar absorptance and infrared emittance are ( a normal , ε normal ) = (0.829, 0.055) for the solar heating mode and (0.361, 0.835) for the radiative cooling mode, respectively. The underlying mechanism pertains to the Fabry–Pérot resonance and antireflection. The modulation property of the smart film remains excellent even when the incident angle is large. Furthermore, the smart film is capable of achieving multilevel modulation through the alteration of the crystalline IST percentage. The excellent modulation properties of the smart film are substantiated through a quantitative assessment of the net heat flux for terrestrial applications. This analysis reveals that the smart film with amorphous IST achieves a solar heating flux of 800 W/m 2 at 250 K, while for crystalline IST it exhibits a radiative cooling flux of 600 W/m 2 at 330 K. Such a simple multilayer structure can be easily fabricated, which would facilitate the advancement and practical implementation of an all-season smart film.},

  abstract     = {Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is widely employed as an electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells due to its low manufacturing cost and favorable energy-level alignment. However, the suboptimal quality of TiO 2 films and the presence of multiple defects at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface, such as uncoordinated Pb 2+ and oxygen vacancy defects, significantly compromise both device efficiency and stability. This study proposes a synergistic passivation strategy through the introduction of an acetylamino-functionalized interlayer between the perovskite and TiO 2 . The acetylamino groups within the passivation layer establish strong interactions with uncoordinated Pb 2+ in the perovskite, thereby enhancing interface stability. Acetylamino groups can also interact with the TiO 2 layer by bonding with Ti 4+ and reducing oxygen vacancy defects, thereby enhancing the electron transport potential of the TiO 2 layer. The enhanced hydrophobicity of the TiO 2 film, induced by the passivation layer, further promotes perovskite crystallization by minimizing surface tension effects during film growth. Therefore, the device efficiency significantly increased from 16.49% to 19.26%. The lifetime of the unencapsulated device was evaluated under environmental conditions (relative humidity: 30% ± 5%, temperature: 25 ± 5 °C).

  abstract     = {Growing a 3D film on a 2D substrate, a process often referred to as quasi-van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, is generally believed to involve both chemical and vdW interactions at the interface. To date, the competition between chemical and vdW interactions at the interface has yet to be established. In this work, we demonstrate that the chemical activity of deposited species is crucial for determining the structure of the 3D/2D heterointerface. During pulsed laser deposition, the chemical activity of SrTiO 3 (STO) can be adjusted by controlling the oxygen partial pressure. Therefore, the relative contributions of chemical and vdW interactions at the STO/mica interface can be tuned. This finding ultimately explains the coexistence of [111] and [001] orientations in STO epitaxy on mica.},

At room temperature (RT), the MIS-HEMT fabricated with an atomic layer deposited (ALD)-Al 2 O 3 (MIS-HEMT B) exhibits higher maximum drain current ( I d,max ), peak transconductance ( g m,max ), and lower subthreshold slope ( SS ) and gate leakage current compared to MIS-HEMT A fabricated without ex situ Al 2 O 3 , signifying the effectiveness of the ALD-Al 2 O 3 layer to passivate severe surface states. Of note, when the temperature rises from 298 to 423 K, the values of I d,max and g m,max decrease noticeably, while SS and gate leakage current increase considerably in both MIS-HEMTs A and B. However, MIS-HEMT B demonstrates a lower degradation rate in various device properties at 423 K compared to MIS-HEMT A, implying that ALD-Al 2 O 3 passivation improves thermal stability. Additionally, ALD-Al 2 O 3 passivation reduces the interface state density from 7.48 × 10 12 to 5.3 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 , highlighting its critical role in improving overall device performance.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical modulation of the current rectification ratio and turn-on voltage of p–n diodes by selecting semiconductor materials with appropriate Fermi levels remains challenging in practice. Key obstacles include lattice matching, thermal compatibility, and chemical stability during material synthesis. Most nonvolatile diodes are realized in ferroelectric systems, but size effects in ferroelectrics limit device miniaturization. In this work, we demonstrate an electrically tunable nonvolatile diode based on non-ferroelectric two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures of GeSe and a quasi-2D electron gas on SrTiO 3 surfaces. The device achieves a tunable current rectification ratio of 10 3 –10 4 without gate bias application, with a continuously adjustable turn-on voltage from 0.1 to 2.1 V. Furthermore, the heterostructure demonstrates nonvolatile resistance switching behavior induced by applied bias voltage. The integration of electrical tunability and non-volatility in a single non-ferroelectric diode offers a promising platform for low-dimensional nonvolatile memory devices with multi-bit storage capability.},

  abstract     = {Liquid marble (LM) is a droplet covered with jammed low-wettability fine particles, which exhibits non-sticking to contacting media while keeping its fluid reconfigurability. While the LM facilitated the handling of the droplet, LM breaks down upon squeezing, which limits the robust handling. Here, we show that LM exhibits high compression stability when the jammed particles distort the liquid surface to form sub- to single-micron roughness. We find that the particle layers&#39; distortion increases with the evaporation of the inner liquid. Thus, we regulated the evaporation degree of the droplet by varying the mixing ratio of the nonvolatile and volatile liquids. First, we show the regulation of the mixing ratio and its effect on the equilibrium LM static shape and particle layer structure. Then, the effect of the LMs&#39; surface structure on their mechanical response is explored. When 90% of the inner liquid is evaporated, the submicrometer wrinkle structure appears on the LM surface. We name the LM with the wrinkle structure “wrinkled liquid marble (WLM).” The WLM exhibited high compression stability and significantly higher resilience force than the droplet one. We believe this work helps the practical use of the LMs by improving their mechanical stability. Moreover, the fundamental understanding of the particle layer stability at the interface can be advanced.},

This study investigates the impact of growth temperature on the electro-optic (EO) performance of BTO films, revealing a clear correlation between lower growth temperatures and reduced EO coefficients. Notably, BTO films grown at 400 °C maintain significant EO coefficients of approximately 51.6 pm/V. These findings underscore the potential of low-temperature grown BTO films for high-performance EO applications.

  abstract     = {We introduce a heterostructure integrating a two-dimensional nonlinear GaSe film on a silicon metasurface supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (BIC) mode, to enhance the nonlinear sum-frequency generation (SFG) process in the GaSe film, where incoming shortwave infrared (SWIR) photons are upconverted to visible photons. The wavelength selectivity in the silicon metasurface corresponding to different configurations enables the GaSe film/silicon tunable metasurface heterostructure to have a response in the range of 1500–1630 nm, covering the telecommunication C and L bands. The response spectrum is derived from the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance of the metasurface structure, and the pump light and signal light correspond to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances of the metasurface structure. The high quality-factor of the quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance brought by the metasurface greatly improves the density of the electromagnetic field near the GaSe film, thus improving the sum-frequency generation conversion efficiency in the GaSe film. The pump and signal corresponding to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances introduced by the silicon metasurface are designed in the telecommunication band, while the sum-frequency light is located in the range that can be directly detected by a silicon detector. The low noise level in a silicon detector can guarantee the high sensitivity detection of shortwave infrared light. The results indicate that the upconversion detector attained a peak detectivity of 1.4 × 10 12 Jones at 1555.1 nm, comparable to commercial broadband InGaAs detectors (Thorlabs).},
