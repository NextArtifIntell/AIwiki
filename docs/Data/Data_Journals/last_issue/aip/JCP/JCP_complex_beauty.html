  abstract = {In this study, we investigated the structural variability of mRNA in the human ribosome by comparing two spin-labeling strategies: one involving an mRNA analog bearing two spin labels attached to the ribose-phosphate backbone and the other placing labels at the nucleotide bases. The use of two strategies of spin labeling of mRNAs allowed us to study for the first time the effect of the structure and location of spin labels on the measured interspin distances in human ribosome complexes. Experiments using dipolar EPR spectroscopy, supported by molecular dynamics calculations, demonstrated that labels introduced at nucleotide bases provide a higher resolution between mRNA conformations in the ribosome mRNA channel, compared to labels introduced at the ribose-phosphate backbone. Although ribose-phosphate labeling turned out to be less informative on its own for studying mRNA conformations in the ribosome than the previously used base labeling, it can find application in other complex studies of the structure of RNAs and their complexes.},

  abstract = {The elasticity of phospholipid membranes as a function of hydration was investigated using coarse-grained molecular simulations. Multilamellar membranes consist of two or more lipid bilayers separated by a thin layer of water, a system commonly found in cell membranes that provides surface tension in the alveoli of the lungs and on cartilaginous surfaces of synovial joints. The objective was to quantify the response of such systems to compression in the direction perpendicular to the membranes as a function of the amount of water between the bilayers or hydration of the system. The present study investigated a variety of phospholipids with six levels of hydration found in multilamellar bilayers in biological systems. Our simulations support the existence of a universal behavior of the increase in surface area per lipid as a function of the normal pressure difference, the difference between the pressure applied in the direction normal to the membrane and the pressure applied in the directions parallel to the membrane. Normalizing the surface area per lipid and the pressure difference by their respective values at rupture yields a composite function of two linear regimes for all the hydration levels under investigation. Where possible, a physics-based interpretation of the normalization scales was provided. Although some parameters of the model are determined empirically, the model represents a promising step in continuum modeling of the response of multilamellar lipid membranes as a function of mechanical stress and hydration.},

In this work, we study the wetting behavior of biomolecular condensates on various substrates. We use confocal microscopy to measure the contact angles of model condensates formed by intrinsically disordered protein Ddx4 N . We show the importance of taking optical aberrations into account, as these impact apparent contact angle measurements. Ddx4 N condensates are seen to partially dry (contact angles above 90°) a model membrane, with little dependence on the magnitude of charge on, or tyrosine content of, Ddx4 N . Further contact angle measurements on surfaces of varying hydrophilicity reveal a preference of Ddx4 N condensates for hydrophobic surfaces, suggesting an intrinsic repulsion between protein condensates and hydrophilic membrane surfaces. This observation is in line with previous studies relating protein adsorption to surface hydrophilicity. Our work advances the understanding of the molecular details governing the localization of biomolecular condensates.},

At low activity, all models exhibit similar behavior; as activity increases, subtle differences emerge in intermediate regimes, but at high activity, their behaviors converge. Adjusting for differences in mean active force reveals nearly identical behavior across models, even across varying filament configurations and bending rigidities. Our results highlight the importance of force definitions in active polymer simulations and provide insights into phase transitions across varying filament configurations.},

Here, we report a theoretical study on the phase behavior of XLCMs with symmetric and asymmetric side blocks by using the self-consistent field theory (SCFT). A large number of ordered structures, including smectic phases, simple and giant polygons, are obtained as solutions of the SCFT equations. Phase diagrams of XLCMs as a function of the total length and asymmetric ratio of the side chains are constructed. For XLCMs with symmetric side blocks, the theoretically predicted phase transition sequence is in good agreement with experiments. For XLCMs with a fixed total side chain length, transitions between layered structure to polygonal phases, as well as between different polygonal phases, could be induced by varying the asymmetry of the side chains. The free energy density, domain size, side chain stretching, and molecular orientation are analyzed to elucidate mechanisms stabilizing the different ordered phases.},

S086 has two crystalline forms (α and ξ) with the same molecular composition, but only the crystal structure of the latter has been disclosed. Using the carboxylic group (COO − ) and the amide group (CONH) as structural probes, the core structures and local dynamics of the Ca 2+ coordination complex in the unit cell of the two cocrystals were examined by ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. A notable variation in the molar ratio of bidentate to bridging binding types of COO − groups that bind to Ca 2+ was first identified between the two crystal forms by linear IR spectroscopy. This variation is accompanied by greater local structural rigidity of the α-crystal compared to that of the ξ-crystal, as evidenced by a greater residual amplitude in the spectral diffusion dynamics extracted from the time-dependent 2D IR spectroscopy. Vibrational energy transfer between the bidentate and tridentate COO − groups in the α-crystal was found to be faster than that in the ξ-crystal, suggesting shorter intermolecular distances between EXP3174 and sacubitril in the former. These findings provide dynamical structural parameters that help to understand the stability and releasing mechanisms of the drug molecules.},

We find that interfacial fluctuations of the slab are well-described by capillary wave theory, despite the existence of bubbles in the dense phase. We attribute this to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial relaxation. We also characterize the dependence of liquid and vapor densities on the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system, displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave fluctuations.},

To address this problem, this study pioneers the application of deep operator networks to effectively model the time-dependent piezoionic effect. By leveraging a data-driven approach, our model significantly reduces computational time compared to traditional finite element analysis (FEA). In particular, we trained a DeepONet using a comprehensive dataset generated through FEA calibrated to experimental data. Through rigorous testing with step responses, slow-changing forces, and dynamic-changing forces, we show that the model captures the intricate temporal dynamics of the piezoionic effect in both the horizontal and vertical planes. This capability offers a powerful tool for real-time analysis of piezoionic phenomena, contributing to simplifying the design of tactile interfaces and potentially complementing existing tactile imaging technologies.},

  abstract = {Condensed phase explosives typically contain defects such as voids, bubbles, and pores; this heterogeneity facilitates the formation of hot spots and triggers decomposition reaction at low densities. The study of the thermal decomposition mechanisms of explosives at different densities has thus attracted considerable research interest. Gaining a deeper insight into these mechanisms would be helpful for elucidating the detonation processes of explosives. In this work, we developed an ab initio neural network potential for the FOX-7 system using machine learning method. Extensive large-scale (1008 atoms) and long-duration (nanosecond timescale) deep potential molecular dynamics simulations at different densities were performed to investigate the effect of the density on the thermal decomposition mechanism. The results indicate that the initial reaction pathway of the FOX-7 explosives is the cleavage of the C–NO 2 bond at different densities, while the frequency of C–NO 2 bond cleavage decreases at higher density. Increasing the initial density of FOX-7 significantly increases the reaction rate during the initial decomposition and the formation of final products. However, it leads to a decrease in released heat and has minimal impact on the decomposition temperature. In addition, by analyzing the molecular dynamics trajectories and conducting quantum chemical calculations, we identified two lower-barrier production pathways to produce the CO 2 and N 2 .},

  abstract = {The most efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently developed using antisolvent-based fabrication technology. Despite extensive analysis of various aspects of the antisolvent method—such as the type of antisolvent, dropping time, and precursor compatibility—some antisolvents still produce uneven film surface morphology on centimeter-scale substrates. The decoupling of the relationship between local structural characteristics, such as grain boundaries and defects, and the optoelectronic performance of PSCs is currently one of the most highly regarded research issues in the field. In this study, we utilized high-resolution white light interferometry to characterize the morphological distributions of perovskite films from the center to edge, using anisole as an example of the antisolvent. We observed that macro cracks at the center of the film typically exhibit dense ridge morphology, while cracks toward the edges display a concave morphology. We analyze the stress mechanism by using EDS mapping and AFM in detail, attributing this phenomenon to the competitive attachment of 2D islands and boundaries for adatoms, which are influenced by changes in grain size. The devices at different locations were fabricated and their performance analyzed. Our findings indicate that these protruding cracks do not significantly affect the current and voltage of the photovoltaic device; however, concave cracks lead to a decrease in the device fill factor. We attribute this decrease to enhanced carrier recombination at the interface due to this morphology. This study provides valuable insights into the formation of perovskite film morphology under antisolvent treatment and the relationship between film local morphology and PSCs performance.},

  abstract = {The traditional Gouy–Chapman–Stern theory has been effective in explaining the behavior of dilute electrolytes in the electrical double layer but falls short when it comes to describing how ions behave at the metal/electrolyte interface. This is because it overlooks key factors such as the molecular structure of water at the interface and the effects of electron screening in the metal. To address these gaps, we revisit ion adsorption at the metal/electrolyte interface. The approach combines the method of images with a field-theoretic framework for dilute electrolytes and metals described by the Thomas–Fermi model. Nonlocal polarization correlations in water are described by a first-order gradient expansion in the Landau free energy functional. Unlike earlier approaches that relied on the “specular reflection approximation,” our method provides a less constrained way to handle the complex electrostatic boundary conditions at the interface. Analyzing the behavior of a test charge near the interface, an electrostatic energy minimum is found. This minimum depends on the metal’s screening properties and the overall potential drop across the double layer. In addition, the alignment of water dipoles at the interface creates an asymmetry in the energy experienced by positively and negatively charged ions. Finally, we derived an expression for the electrosorption isotherm by describing both the distribution of the electrostatic potential and the lateral interactions between charges along the interface. Our findings highlight how the structure of interfacial water can drive processes such as underpotential deposition by creating favorable electrostatic conditions for ion adsorption.},

The solid state route is adopted to prepare these dilute weight% ( x = 1, 3, and 5) ferrite based composites. The incorporation of ferrite phase improves the interfacial tensile strain and grain boundary volume fraction in the said composite. The incommensurate to commensurate magnetic transition (T N2 ) of YBaCuFeO 5 is shifted to a high temperature by 10 K with the lowest concentration and indistinguishable in higher concentrations due to the magnetic dominance of ferrites. The irreversibility of magnetization due to the field history mostly stems from the uncompensated spins and a competitive interaction among the magnetic phases at the interface. The magnetic isotherms show unusual negative exchange bias phenomena in the said system, and a large room temperature spontaneous exchange bias (∼1 kOe) is achieved with a dilute incorporation x = 5. The exchange bias field and coercive fields (H C ) are, however, contrary to each other with temperature (and concentration) explained with a schematic model on the basis of dominating irreversible spins at high temperatures. In a field of ±50 kOe, the exchange bias field is dropped, while H C is increased, which might be due to the dominance of Zeeman energy over the uniaxial anisotropy. The non-collinear magnetic phase transition of YBaCuFeO 5 at T ≤ 175 K plays a pivotal role in reducing the exchange bias compared to its collinear phase (300 K). Moreover, the extent of this bias field (∼1 kOe) can be considered a useful component in efficient device fabrication.},

  abstract = {We model charge-carrier hopping transport and electron–hole recombination in realistic amorphous structures of different densities and use the obtained results to assess the quality of the lattice models with Gaussian energy disorder, which have been the main theoretical tool in the studies of amorphous organic semiconductors. We find that the hopping-site energy distributions inferred from the amorphous structures deviate from the Gaussian distribution, especially in their low-energy tails. Mostly for this reason, the effect of disorder on charge-carrier mobility is much weaker than predicted by the lattice/Gaussian models and dependent on system density. The lattice models of electron–hole recombination in disordered systems, which assume a Gaussian site energy distribution, are found to be more accurate than those of charge-carrier transport. This is explained by the strong Coulomb trapping of electron–hole pairs before recombination, which makes the role of hopping-site energy disorder less significant.},

  abstract = {The premise that the dielectric α relaxation has a one-to-one correspondence with entropy fluctuations in equilibrium near the glass transition was experimentally verified in a systematic and quantitative manner for glass-forming systems in general. Validation of this relation was structured at different levels, taking into account various ingredients as the apolar–polar character, macromolecular structure, the presence of hydrogen bonds, or complex structure and dynamics. The results reclaim the suitability of dielectric spectroscopy to echo the primary structural relaxation of glass-forming systems, demonstrating that the dielectric response effectively captures the structural relaxation by reliably correlating with entropy fluctuations. The correlation with entropy fluctuations holds even when the dielectric strength of the systems is high and the dielectric response is narrow and dominated by cross correlations, proving that dipolar intermolecular interactions are fundamental to the structural relaxation and not a particularity of the dielectric probe. This one-to-one correspondence between structural and dielectric α relaxation does not support the existence of a generic spectral shape for the primary structural relaxation valid for all kinds of susceptibility functions.},

In this study, we employ a deep neural network trained on density functional theory data to investigate the dielectric properties of liquid water at room temperature across a pressure range of 0.1–1000 MPa. We observe a nonlinear increase in the static dielectric constant ɛ 0 with increasing pressure, a trend that is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. This increase in ɛ 0 is primarily attributed to the increase in water density under compression, which enhances collective dipole fluctuations within the hydrogen-bonding network as well as the dielectric response. Despite the increase in ɛ 0 , our results reveal a decrease in the Kirkwood correlation factor G K with increasing pressure. This decrease in G K is attributed to pressure-induced structural distortions in the hydrogen-bonding network, which weaken dipolar correlations by disrupting the ideal tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules.},

The size of the central ring is systematically varied, as is the inherent level of disorder in the surrounding network (as controlled by the Monte Carlo “temperature” and characterized by the fraction of six-membered rings). The effect of the central ring on the overall network topology is analyzed in terms of both topological and geometric distances. For larger central rings, the first topological shell becomes exclusively populated by four- and five-membered rings, which leads to an effective upper limit on the size of the central ring that can effectively be accommodated. The topological shells are found to show ordering at significant distances away from the central ring. The effective correlation lengths are determined as a function of both central ring size and level of network disorder, which allows for an understanding of the potential density of large rings that may be accommodated.},

  abstract = {Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) are environmentally friendly green solvents and hold great promise in the pharmaceutical industry. The secondary structure of a protein, lysozyme, follows a non-monotonous behavior in aqueous glyceline (choline chloride + glycerol) as the wt. % of water is increased. However, it is unclear how the hydration affects the stability of the protein in a non-linear way. In this work, we have performed all-atom molecular dynamic simulations for 1 μ s with the lysozyme protein in an aqueous glyceline deep eutectic solvent (DES) by varying the wt. % of water. The simulated radius of gyration, R g , values can qualitatively reproduce the protein behavior such that the R g increases initially with an increase in wt. % of water, reaches the peak at 40 wt. %, and then gradually decreases with dilution. Several other properties, including root mean square deviation, root-mean square fluctuation, secondary structure of the protein, and solvent accessible surface area, are examined to explore the NADES effect on the protein structure. Next, we analyze the hydrogen bond profile of intra-protein and among various interspecies, e.g., protein–DES, DES–DES, protein–water, and water–water. The variation in protein–protein hydrogen bonds with concentrations can qualitatively explain the non-linear conformational dependence of the protein. The radial distribution function analyses show various microscopic structures formed due to the DES and water interaction, which play a critical role in protein behavior. This study indicates that at lower wt. % of water, the protein is constrained in a strong hydrogen bond network formed by glycerol and water molecules, resulting in a lower R g . As the wt. % of water increases, the protein–water interaction drives the protein to expand, reflecting an increasing R g . At sufficiently higher wt. % of water, the DES constituent and the water molecules interact strongly with the protein, resulting in a decrease in R g . Overall, the investigation offers a microscopic insight into the protein conformation in DES.},

The model provides unique access to both local and global properties associated with marginal stability. We directly measure pseudo-gaps in the spectrum of local excitations, as well as diverging fluctuations under shear. Crucially, the dynamics are dominated by a small population of bonds that are locally unstable, which give rise to quasi-localized, low-frequency vibrational modes and scale-free avalanches of instabilities. We propose a correction to the scaling between the pseudo-gap exponent and avalanche statistics based on diverging length fluctuations. Our model combines a coarse-grained view with a continuous, real-space implementation, providing novel insights to a wide class of amorphous solids.},

Interestingly, while the supramolecular gelator significantly alters the macroscopic behavior of the solvent at concentrations of 0.3 and 0.5 wt. %, it does not affect the hydrogen bond network at the microscopic level. In contrast, the addition of PCM at 5 wt. %, which does not change the macroscopic properties, modifies the structural dynamics of water–ethanol mixtures at length scales commensurate with and below the PCM–PCM correlation length in the mixture. This study reveals the intricate interplay between solute, solvent, and gel interactions, demonstrating a lack of direct correlation between macroscopic and microscopic properties in such complex systems.},

  abstract = {The lack of a well-defined equilibrium reference configuration has long hindered a comprehensive atomic-level understanding of liquid dynamics and properties. The Instantaneous Normal Mode (INM) approach, which involves diagonalizing the Hessian matrix of potential energy in instantaneous liquid configurations, has emerged as a promising framework in this direction. However, several conceptual challenges remain, particularly related to the approach’s inability to capture anharmonic effects. In this study, we present a set of “experimental facts” through a comprehensive INM analysis of simulated systems, including Ar, Xe, N 2 , CS 2 , Ga, and Pb, across a wide temperature range from the solid to gas phase. First, we examine the INM density of states (DOS) and compare it to the DOS obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function. We then analyze the temperature dependence of the fraction of unstable modes and the low-frequency slope of the INM DOS in search of potential universal behaviors. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between INMs and other properties of liquids, including the liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover and the momentum gap of collective shear waves. In addition, we investigate the INM spectrum at low temperatures as the system approaches the solid phase, revealing a significant fraction of unstable modes even in crystalline solids. Finally, we confirm the existence of a recently discussed cusp-like singularity in the INM eigenvalue spectrum and uncover its complex temperature-dependent behavior, challenging current theoretical models.},

The static limits of these results are entered into a model aimed at reproducing nonlinear dielectric susceptibility spectra using the concept of a fictive electric field. This model reproduces the “hump” in the third-harmonic response and its seeming disappearance. It is revealed that the “hump” is predominantly the result of reduced time constants, a consequence of the energy the sample absorbs from the electric field.

  abstract = {This study delves into the fragmentation mechanisms of the oxazolone form (OXA) of protonated cyclo-di-glycine using chemical dynamics simulations at multiple internal energies. While we focus our in-depth analyses on a representative total energy of 178 kcal/mol, we also performed simulations over the 127–187 kcal/mol range. This broader energy sampling reveals how the population of states evolves with increasing internal energy, enabling us to compute rate constants and then effective energy thresholds using a previously introduced three-state model [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. By transforming molecular geometries into graph representations, we systematically analyze fragmentation processes and identify key intermediates and ion–molecule complexes (IMCs) that play a crucial role in fragmentation dynamics. The study highlights the distinct isomerization landscapes of OXA, driven by IMC formation, which contrasts with the previously reported behavior of cyclic and linear forms [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. The resulting fragmentation channels are characterized by their unique energetic thresholds and branching ratios and can provide a molecular explanation of what was observed experimentally. Thanks to an accurate analysis of the trajectories using our graph-theory-based tools, it was possible to point out the particular behavior of OXA fragmentation, which is different from other isomers. In particular, the important role of IMCs is shown, which has an impact on populating different isomeric structures.},

The measured kinetic energy releases are in general agreement with AIMD simulations, and the deduced amount of energy transfer into the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom of CO 2+ is about 3 eV less than that estimated by the Coulomb potential.},

Then, the templating synthon approach is used to improve the accuracy of structures optimized by a hybrid density functional paired with a double zeta basis set, leveraging chemical similarity to cluster different molecular environments and refine bond lengths and valence angles. A set of prototypical biomolecular building blocks is used to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve spectroscopic accuracy for molecular systems too large to be treated by state-of-the-art composite wavefunction methods. In addition, a freely accessible web-based tool has been developed to facilitate the post-processing of geometries optimized using standard electronic structure codes, thereby providing an accurate and efficient tool for the computational study of medium- to large-sized molecules, also accessible to experiment-oriented researchers.},

  abstract = {A high level quantum mechanical study has been performed to explore the structural rearrangement and relative stability of the X H 4 + (X = C, Si, Ge) radical cations at their X ̃ 2 T 2 ground electronic states. All the stationary points located on the lowest adiabatic sheet of the Jahn–Teller (JT) split X ̃ 2 T 2 state are fully optimized and characterized by performing harmonic vibrational frequency calculations. Five JT distorted stationary points with D 2 d ( B 2 2 ) ⁠ , C 3 v ( A 1 2 ) ⁠ , C 2 v ( B 2 2 ) ⁠ , and C s ( A ′ 2 ) symmetries are located on the C H 4 + ground state potential energy surface (PES), whereas four such structures are found on each of the SiH 4 + and GeH 4 + PESs. While the C 2 v ( B 2 2 ) isomer is found to be a global minimum and the C s ( A ′ 2 ) one as a transition state for C H 4 + ⁠ , the nature of them is reversed for SiH 4 + and GeH 4 + ⁠ . In particular, the C s ( A ′ 2 ) stationary points are now global minima for the latter pair of radical cations, and C 2 v ( B 2 2 ) represents the transition state. Attempts are being made to understand such inconsistent findings via a combination of JT and epikernel principles. The barriers between equivalent C 2 v ( B 2 2 ) global minimum structures for C H 4 + are found to be low, and thus C H 4 + undergoes rapid interconversion along cyclic exchange of three hydrogen atoms via C s transition state. The general features of the ground state PESs of SiH 4 + and GeH 4 + are similar. The pseudorotation between the C s lowest energy structures undergoes along SiH 2 and GeH 2 wagging motions via C 2 v ( B 2 2 ) transition state for SiH 4 + and GeH 4 + ⁠ , respectively.},

  abstract = {Complete datasets of rate coefficients for the vibrational quenching of molecular nitrogen by collision with electronically excited atomic oxygen O( 1 D) over a wide temperature range are calculated for the first time. Such data are important ingredients in the modeling of non-local thermal equilibrium conditions that characterize the atmosphere, media of astronomical interest, and cold and hot plasmas, where O( 1 D), also formed when O 2 molecules break, represents a significant fraction of the gas mixture. To this end, we developed analytical potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the 1 Π and 1 Δ electronic states of the N 2 –O( 1 D) system to accurately describe the interaction in the long, medium, and first repulsive range of intermolecular distances, the most effective regions in inelastic collisions under a variety of conditions of interest. The derived PESs are used to calculate the vibration-to-translation (V–T) and vibration-to-electronic (V–E) energy transfer rates by mixed quantum–classical dynamics and by the Landau–Zener formulation, respectively. In addition, the datasets are extended to cover the entire N 2 vibrational ladder by using the Gaussian process regression. The results show that at low temperatures, where V–E relaxation dominates, N 2 vibrational quenching by O( 1 D) collisions is faster than by O( 3 P) collisions.},

  abstract = {The nature of argentophilic interaction in the 2,2′-bipyridine-coordinated silver complex, which manifests counterintuitive cation–cation “attraction,” is attributed to ligand stacking and solvation effects in the present article. While charged closed-shell transition metal complexes aggregating spontaneously to form oligomers has long been observed experimentally, the interpretation of the nature of so-called metallophilicity is still ongoing. For the dimer [(2,2′-bpy) 2 Ag] 2 2+ , qualitative electrostatic potential, non-covalent interaction, atoms-in-molecules analyses, and quantitative energy decomposition analysis calculations indicate that the electrostatic repulsion between two like formal charges at silver centers can be overcome by long-range dispersion attraction and short-range electronic correlation from ligands. In addition, delocalizing the net charges on silvers over the whole ligands can decrease electrostatic repulsion of metal centers to stabilize oligomers. The vital role of the screening effect of solvent has also been realized in the bound binding of the title system. Overall, this research highlights the importance of ligand stacking to argentophilicity, while d 10 –d 10 attraction of silver centers presents quite little contribution.},

In this work, high level, state-of-the-art computations at the finite temperature density functional theory and highly correlated CCSD(T) levels indicate that a syn -periplanar conformation of the H–C–O–H bonds, in which the C–H and O–H bonds eclipse each other, is a three-fold global minimum in the potential energy surface for internal rotation of the O–H bond. We show that vicinal hyperconjugation between the orbitals in the C–H bonds and in the oxygen atom is responsible for this puzzling conformational preference. The transition state for the rotation yields an ≈ 0.6 kcal/mol rotational barrier, which matches the thermal energy at room conditions and, therefore, renders the O–H bond a free rotor. The molecular wave function has a moderate multireference character with the oxygen atom acting as the preferred spot for static correlation.},

Our group recently synthesized a series of end-to-end bent perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophanes, whose degree of bending is adjustable by modifying the internal alkyl tethers. Herein, we subjected these bent PBI derivatives to theoretical calculations and time-resolved spectroscopy. The current study has offered rational explanations for several unique photophysical characteristics of bent PBIs: (1) the redshifts of the S 0 –S 1 transitions, (2) the decrease in extinction coefficients, (3) the broadening of spectral shapes, and (4) the suppression of nonradiative decay processes. Furthermore, the investigation of the S 1 states and radical anions has revealed that structural bending also substantially alters the energy levels of upper molecular orbitals such as LUMO+2.},

We report on the computational design of a zinc-rich D 3 h ( 1 A 1 ′) B 3 Zn 6 − alloy cluster, whose global-minimum structure is a hybrid between prismatic, sandwich-like, and core–shell tubular geometries. The binary cluster features a linear B 3 chain along its C 3 axis, as well as three lateral Zn–Zn dimers, in which a central B atom is sandwiched by two quasi-planar BZn 3 units in an eclipsed form. Chemical bonding analyses show that the B 3 chain motif has Lewis-type B–B σ single bonds and a pair of orthogonal three-center two-electron (3c-2e) π bonds, collectively leading to a B–B bond order of two. Stabilizing a boron single chain is scarce in the literature, as is observing a series of double B=B bonds in a monoatomic chain fashion. The triangular pyramid BZn 3 units are each in a unique triplet σ 2 σ* 1 σ* 1 configuration, thus rendering σ aromaticity to the cluster according to the reversed 4 n Hückel rule. It is proposed that the alloy cluster can be rationalized using the concept of electronic transmutation, wherein a close chemical analogy to the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) molecule is established.},

We investigated the intramolecular charge transfer process in a series of MV organic molecules where two arylamino units are linked together by a variable length bridge. The experimental investigation is carried out by means of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on MV radical cations. The EPR spectra, recorded in a series of solvents at different temperatures, were adequately simulated using a multiple-site random jump model implemented in a software routine, providing the intramolecular charge transfer rate as the output. The dependence of the free energy of the electron transfer process on the solvent allowed us to identify a correlation between the energetic of the charge transfer and some solvent properties.},

In this study, indium-doped silicon clusters (InSi n −/0 , n = 3–11) were investigated using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional calculations. It is found that InSi n − anions exhibit geometrical and electronic structures resembling their Si n+1 counterparts, with the substitution of one silicon atom by an indium atom leading to exohedral doping and multiple coordination characteristics. The exohedral configuration is attributed to a weak In–Si bond and the limited atomic valence of indium, while the multiple coordination arises from the joint contributions of three orthogonal 5 p orbitals of indium atom. Electronic structure similarities between InSi n − anions and Si n+1 clusters are confirmed by their identical valence molecular orbitals. The valence p -type orbitals of InSi n − primarily contribute to chemical bonding, whereas the valence s -type orbitals predominantly hold electron lone pairs, as demonstrated by the electron localization function and localized molecular orbital analysis. These results provide insights into the structural and electronic properties of indium-doped silicon clusters.},

  abstract = {Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flips, and magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange–correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn–Sham (KS) and generalized KS (GKS) orbitals, the KS potentials, and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze seven standard exchange–correlation functionals and find two main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, as well as the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential, when using the optimized effective potential method within the KS scheme. When calculations are performed using the GKS approach, no jumps are observed, as expected. Moreover, we demonstrate that for high-spin systems, a full three-dimensional treatment is crucial; the spherical approximation commonly used in atoms causes a qualitative deviation. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.},

Shortly after photoexcitation, in all cases, the primary multiplet polarization of the porphyrin triplet state evolves into long-lived net polarization whose lifetime is determined by the lifetime of the triplet state. The zero-field splitting parameters and sign of the multiplet polarization vary significantly among the porphyrins, but the transient EPR spectra taken at later times are remarkably similar.

Recently, the pursuit of this goal has been aided by machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which provide energies and forces at quantum mechanical accuracy but at a fraction of the cost of the reference quantum mechanical calculations. Assembling the training set of relevant configurations is key to building the MLIP. Here, we demonstrate two approaches to training reactive MLIPs based on reaction pathway information. One approach exploits reaction datasets containing reactant, product, and transition state structures. Using an S N 2 reaction dataset, we accurately locate reaction pathways and transition state geometries of up to 170 unseen reactions. In another approach, which does not depend on data availability, we present an efficient active learning procedure that yields an accurate MLIP and converged minimum energy path given only the reaction end point structures, avoiding quantum mechanics driven reaction pathway search at any stage of training set construction. We demonstrate this procedure on an S N 2 reaction in the gas phase and with a small number of solvating water molecules, predicting reaction barriers within 20 meV of the reference quantum chemistry method. We then apply the active learning procedure on a more complex reaction involving a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and proton transfer, comparing the results against the reactive ReaxFF force field. Our active learning procedure, in addition to rapidly finding reaction paths for individual reactions, provides an approach to building large reaction path databases for training transferable reactive machine learning potentials.},

Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: neural spline flows, conditional flow matching, and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) neural spline flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) conditional flow matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) denoising diffusion probabilistic models appear the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib 9 peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.},

  abstract = {Large-scale atomistic simulations rely on interatomic potentials, providing an efficient representation of atomic energies and forces. Modern machine-learning (ML) potentials provide the most precise representation compared to electronic structure calculations, while traditional potentials provide a less precise but computationally much faster representation and, thus, allow simulations of larger systems. We present a method to combine a traditional and a ML potential into a multi-resolution description, leading to an adaptive-precision potential with an optimum of performance and precision in large, complex atomistic systems. The required precision is determined per atom by a local structure analysis and updated automatically during simulation. We use copper as demonstrator material with an embedded atom model as classical force field and an atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as ML potential, but, in principle, a broader class of potential combinations can be coupled by this method. The approach is developed for the molecular-dynamics simulator LAMMPS and includes a load-balancer to prevent problems due to the atom dependent force-calculation times, which makes it suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. The developed adaptive-precision copper potential represents the ACE-forces with a precision of 10 me V/Å and the ACE-energy exactly for the precisely calculated atoms in a nanoindentation of 4 × 10 6 atoms calculated for 100 ps and shows a speedup of 11.3 compared with a full ACE simulation.},

  abstract = {Sparse data-driven approaches enable the approximation of governing laws of physical processes with parsimonious equations. While significant effort has been made in this field over the last decade, data-driven approaches generally rely on the paradigm of imposing a fixed base of library functions. In order to promote sparsity, finding the optimal set of basis functions is a necessary condition but a challenging task to guess in advance. Here, we propose an alternative approach that consists of optimizing the very library of functions while imposing sparsity. The robustness of our results is not only evaluated by the quality of the fit of the discovered model but also by the statistical distribution of the residuals with respect to the original noise in the data. In order to avoid choosing one metric over the other, we would rather rely on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for systematically generating a subset of optimal models sorted in a Pareto front. We illustrate how this method can be used as a tool to derive microkinetic equations from experimental data.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is finding increasingly more applications in quantum chemistry, particularly to simulate electronic structure and molecular properties of simple systems. The transformation of a molecular Hamiltonian from the fermionic space to the qubit space results in a series of Pauli strings. Calculating the energy then involves evaluating the expectation values of each of these strings, which presents a significant bottleneck for applying variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) in quantum chemistry. Unlike fermionic Hamiltonians, the terms in a qubit Hamiltonian are additive. This work leverages this property to introduce a novel method for extracting information from the partial qubit Hamiltonian, thereby enhancing the efficiency of VQEs. This work introduces the SHARC-VQE (Simplified Hamiltonian Approximation, Refinement, and Correction-VQE) method, where the full molecular Hamiltonian is partitioned into two parts based on the ease of quantum execution. The easy-to-execute part constitutes the partial Hamiltonian, and the remaining part, while more complex to execute, is generally less significant. The latter is approximated by a refined operator and added up as a correction into the partial Hamiltonian. SHARC-VQE significantly reduces computational costs for molecular simulations. The cost of a single energy measurement can be reduced from O ( N 4 ϵ 2 ) to O ( 1 ϵ 2 ) for a system of N qubits and accuracy ϵ , while the overall cost of VQE can be reduced from O ( N 7 ϵ 2 ) to O ( N 3 ϵ 2 ) ⁠ . Furthermore, measurement outcomes using SHARC-VQE are less prone to errors induced by noise from quantum circuits, reducing the errors from 20%–40% to 5%–10% without any additional error correction or mitigation technique. In addition, the SHARC-VQE is demonstrated as an initialization technique, where the simplified partial Hamiltonian is used to identify an optimal starting point for a complex problem. Overall, this method improves the efficiency of VQEs and enhances the accuracy and reliability of quantum simulations by mitigating noise and overcoming computational challenges.},

  abstract = {High-resolution techniques capable of manipulating from single molecules to millions of cells are combined with three-dimensional modeling followed by simulation to comprehend the specific aspects of chromosomes. From the theoretical perspective, the energy landscape theory from protein folding inspired the development of the minimal chromatin model (MiChroM). In this work, two biologically relevant MiChroM energy terms were minimized under different conditions, revealing a competition between loci compartmentalization and motor-driven activity mechanisms in chromatin folding. Enhancing the motor activity energy baseline increased the lengthwise compaction and reduced the polymer entanglement. Concomitantly, decreasing compartmentalization-related interactions reduced the overall polymer collapse, although compartmentalization given by the microphase separation remained almost intact. For multiple chromosome simulations, increased motorization intensified the territory formation of the different chains and reduced compartmentalization strength lowered the probability of contact formation of different loci between multiple chains, approximating to the experimental inter-contacts of the human chromosomes. These findings have direct implications for experimental data-driven chromosome modeling, specially those involving multiple chromosomes. The interplay between phase-separation and territory formation mechanisms should be properly implemented in order to recover the genome architecture and dynamics, features that might play critical roles in regulating nuclear functions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamic behavior of complex biomolecules requires simplified models that not only make computations feasible but also reveal fundamental mechanisms. Coarse-graining (CG) achieves this by grouping atoms into beads, whose stochastic dynamics can be derived using the Mori–Zwanzig formalism, capturing both reversible and irreversible interactions. In liquid, the dissipative bead–bead interactions have so far been restricted to hydrodynamic couplings. However, friction does not only arise from the solvent but, notably, from the internal degrees of freedom missing in the CG beads. This leads to an additional “internal friction” whose relevance is studied in this contribution. By comparing with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD), we neatly show that in order to accurately reproduce the dynamics of a globular protein in water using a CG model, not only a precise determination of elastic couplings and the Stokesian self-friction of each bead is required. Critically, the inclusion of internal friction between beads is also necessary for a faithful representation of protein dynamics. We propose to optimize the parameters of the CG model through a self-averaging method that integrates the CG dynamics with an evolution equation for the CG parameters. This approach ensures that selected quantities, such as the radial distribution function and the time correlation of bead velocities, match the corresponding MD values.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional optical spectroscopy experiments have examined photoprotective mechanisms in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) photosynthetic complex, showing that exciton transfer pathways change significantly depending on the environmental redox conditions. Higgins et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 118 (11), e2018240118 (2021)] have theoretically linked these observations to changes in a quantum vibronic coupling, whereby onsite energies are altered under oxidizing conditions such that exciton energy gaps are detuned from a specific vibrational motion of the bacteriochlorophyll a . These arguments rely on an analysis of exciton transfer rates within Redfield theory, which is known to provide an inaccurate description of the influence of the vibrational environment on the exciton dynamics in the FMO complex. Here, we use a memory kernel formulation of the hierarchical equations of motion to obtain non-perturbative estimations of exciton transfer rates, which yield a modified physical picture. Our findings indicate that onsite energy shifts alone do not reproduce the reported rate changes in the oxidative environment. We systematically examine a model that includes combined changes in both site energies and the frequency of a local vibration in the oxidized complex while maintaining consistency with absorption spectra and achieving qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with the measured changes in transfer rates. Our analysis points to potential limitations of the FMO electronic Hamiltonian, which was originally derived by fitting spectra to perturbative theories. Overall, our work suggests that further experimental and theoretical analyses may be needed to understand the variations of exciton dynamics under different redox conditions.},

Commun. 12 , 3927 (2021)], the applicability of CCSD(T) is assessed using a model framework. The use of the semi-empirical π -space only Pariser–Parr–Pople (PPP) model for studying large molecules is critically examined and is shown to recover both bandgap closure as system size increases and long range dispersive behavior of r −6 with increasing separation between monomers. Since bandgap closure in systems with long-range Coulomb interactions is problematic for perturbative methods, such as CCSD(T), this model, therefore, serves as a testing ground for such methods, enabling them to be benchmarked with high-order CC methods, which are not possible with ab initio Hamiltonians. Using the PPP model, coupled cluster methodologies, CCSDTQ and CCSDT(Q), are then used to benchmark CCSDT and CCSD(T) methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large one- and two-dimensional molecular systems up to the dibenzocoronene dimer. We show that CCSD(T) demonstrates no signs of overestimating the interaction energy for these systems. Furthermore, by examining the Hartree–Fock HOMO–LUMO gap of these large molecules, the perturbative treatment of the triples contribution in CCSD(T) is not expected to cause problems for accurately capturing the interaction energy for system sizes up to at least circumcoronene.},

Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a δ -function in time. Here, we use the phase-cycling method for the exact calculation of the nonlinear response without making the aforementioned approximations even for high-intensity excitation. We compare the simulation results to several experimental observations to prove the validity of these calculations. The saturation of the photon-echo signal from excitons in a semiconductor quantum well sample is measured. The excitation-intensity dependent measurement shows nonlinear contributions up to twelfth order. Intensity-dependent simulations reproduce this effect without explicitly considering higher-order interactions. In addition, we present simulation results that replicate previously reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signals, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation. This method would be particularly useful for systems with multiple, well-separated peaks and/or large inhomogeneities.},

Extensive validation across diverse interface geometries and evaporation flux magnitudes demonstrates high accuracy, with errors below 5% for unit density ratios. For density contrasts, the method remains robust in the limit of smaller evaporation flux magnitudes and density ratios.

The structure of the state space could be quite complicated for quantum many-body systems, and the systematic decomposition of the state space is normally involved. Recently, a modular tensor diagram approach was proposed to reorganize the state space hierarchically based on a modular basis. Here, we review the construction of spin eigenfunctions for multiple exciton systems and further develop modular tensor diagrams to exemplify the hierarchical symmetry of the state space. The newly constructed spin eigenfunctions for quadruple excitons, along with the results for triple excitons, are used to demonstrate the effective decomposition of the state space into hierarchical tensorial structures. A universal recursive relation is derived to determine the coefficients of spin eigenfunctions exhibiting transformation symmetry between different classes of elementary modules for an arbitrary number of exciton units. Interestingly, different coupling schemes mapped to quantum many-body interactions lead to different spin adapted basis states, which may correspond to different realistic systems upon the breakdown of spin degeneracy. This work highlights the hierarchical symmetry of the tensorial structure of quantum many-body systems, which may facilitate a better understanding of the structure property relationship toward the object-oriented materials design.},

A distinct evolution of the partial rotational modes of N 2 and O 2 outside the selective excitation region was observed, which is related to energy transfer collisions between N 2 and O 2 molecules during the rotational energy relaxation process in air. The SLT results accord well with the S-branch rotational spectra of N 2 and O 2 obtained from theoretical calculations, confirming the validity of SLT analysis.

  abstract = {Recent method developments involving path integral simulations have come a long way in making these techniques practical for studying condensed phase non-equilibrium phenomena. One of the main difficulties that still needs to be surmounted is the scaling of the algorithms with the system dimensionality. The majority of recent techniques have only changed the order of this scaling (going from exponential to possibly a very high-ordered polynomial) and not eased the dependence on the system size. In this current work, we introduce an adaptive kink filtration technique for the path generation approach that leverages the locality of the interactions present in the system and the consequent sparsity of the propagator matrix to remove the asymptotic size dependence of the simulations for the propagation of reduced density matrices. This enables the simulation of larger systems at a significantly reduced cost. This technique can be used for simulation of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium correlation functions and is demonstrated here using examples from both. We show that the cost becomes constant with the dimensionality of the system. The only place where a system size-dependence still remains is the calculation of the dynamical maps or propagators, which are important for the transfer tensor method. The cost of calculating this solvent-renormalized propagator is the same as the cost of propagating all the elements of the reduced density matrix, which scales as the square of the size. This adaptive kink-filtration technique promises to be instrumental in extending the affordability of path integral simulations for very large systems.},

  abstract = {The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and the original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Furthermore, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.},

  abstract = {Solvation free energy is a driving force that plays an important role in the stability of biomolecular conformations. Currently, the implicit solvent model is widely used to calculate solvation energies of biomolecules such as proteins. However, for proteins, the implicit solvent calculation does not provide much detailed information since a protein is highly inhomogeneous on its surface. In this study, we develop an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which allows us to investigate detailed site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, including the role of counter ions and intra-protein interactions. This approach facilitates the analysis of specific residue interactions with solvent molecules, extending the understanding of protein solubility to the energetic impacts of site-specific residue–solvent interactions. Our study showed that specific residue–solvent interactions are strongly influenced by the electrostatic environment created by its nearby residues, especially charged residues. In particular, charged residues on the protein surface are mainly responsible for the heterogeneity of the electrostatic environment of the protein surface, and they significantly affect the local distribution of water. In addition, counter ions change the local electrostatic environment and alter specific residue–water interactions. Neutral residues also interact with water, with polar residues being more prominent than nonpolar ones but contributing less to solvation energy than charged residues. This study illustrates an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which gives residue-specific contributions to protein solvation and provides detailed information on site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity.},

  abstract = {A multidimensional version of the modification to vibrational perturbation theory is developed in this article. The modifications to the action are of two types: one is by shifting the energy scale with the VPT2 zero point energy E 0 (mVPT2) and the other is by shifting the action by a constant VPT2-based action Δ S and is denoted mYF. These modifications give a continuous “modified” action over the whole energy range. The multidimensional versions of the mVPT2 and mYF theories have been applied to the collinear H + H 2 and D + H 2 reactions to calculate thermal reaction rates. The results show that the rates computed using the mVPT2 theory are marginally better than those computed by the mYF theory. The corresponding kinetic isotopic effects have also been computed. Both the theories account for the correct ℏ 2 limit at high temperature and not the parabolic barrier limit as in various other theories. The mVPT2 and mYF theories also improve upon the thermal rates in the low temperature limit due to the shifting of the action by the zero point energy shift E 0 . The resulting theory is more accurate than the ring polymer molecular dynamics based approximation over the whole temperature range probed. The results presented here indicate that the multidimensional version of the modified VPT2 theory may be the recommended method for computing thermal tunneling rates in multidimensional systems.},

  abstract = {Mixed halide inorganic perovskites exhibit exceptional stability and photovoltaic performance and are considered to be promising photovoltaic materials. However, the chemical diversity of these materials presents a vast screening space, making it challenging to efficiently identify high-performance materials solely through theoretical calculations or experiments. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a multidimensional high-throughput screening strategy that combines machine learning with first-principles calculations, specifically designed to identify MHIPs with optimal bandgap and light absorption properties. The bandgap and light absorption models have achieved determination coefficients (r 2 ) of 0.9896 and 0.9833, with root mean square errors of 0.1890 eV and 0.2190 10 5 eV · cm −1 , respectively, demonstrating the high precision and reliability of the models. In the present work, the generation of 306 521 candidate materials through mixed B-site elements is reported, leading to the successful identification of 295 materials with ideal characteristics for MHIPs via screening. Subsequently, an in-depth density functional theory validation is conducted on 20 of these materials. The research results demonstrate that Cs 2 AgBi 0.5 Sb 0.25 Ir 0.25 I 6 and CsSn 0.75 Ge 0.25 I 3 exhibit outstanding performance, making them the most promising candidate materials for practical applications. These results fully confirm the scientific validity and effectiveness of our screening strategy, laying a solid foundation for the exploration and optimization of high-performance perovskite solar cell materials.},

  abstract = {Hydrated electrons are anionic species that are formed when an excess electron is introduced into liquid water. Building an understanding of how hydrated electrons behave in solution has been a long-standing effort of simulation methods, of which density functional theory (DFT) has come to the fore in recent years. The ability of DFT to model the reactive chemistry of hydrated electrons is an attractive advantage over semi-classical methodologies; however, relatively few density functional approximations (DFAs) have been used for the hydrated electron simulations presented in the literature. Here, we simulate hydrated electron systems using a series of exchange–correlation (XC) functionals spanning Jacob’s ladder. We calculate a variety of experimental and other observables of the hydrated electron and compare the XC functional dependence for each quantity. We find that the formation of a stable localized hydrated electron is not necessarily limited to hybrid XC functionals and that some hybrid functionals produce delocalized hydrated electrons or electrons that react with the surrounding water at an unphysically fast rate. We further characterize how different DFAs impact the solvent structure and predicted spectroscopy of the hydrated electron, considering several methods for calculating the hydrated electron’s absorption spectrum for the best comparison between structures generated using different density functionals. None of the dozen or so DFAs that we investigated are able to correctly predict the hydrated electron’s spectroscopy, vertical detachment energy, or molar solvation volume.},
