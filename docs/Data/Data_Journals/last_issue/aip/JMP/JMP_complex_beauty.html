  abstract     = {We consider an infinite system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDE) describing dynamics of the following infinite particle system. Each particle is characterized by its position x ∈ R d and internal parameter (spin) σ x ∈ R ⁠ . While the positions of particles form a fixed (“quenched”) locally-finite set (configuration) γ ⊂ R d ⁠ , the spins σ x and σ y interact via a pair potential whenever x − y &lt; ρ ⁠ , where ρ &gt; 0 is a fixed interaction radius. The number n x of particles interacting with a particle in position x is finite but unbounded in x . The growth of n x as | x | → ∞ creates a major technical problem for solving our SDE system. To overcome this problem, we use a finite volume approximation combined with a version of the Ovsjannikov method, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution in a scale of Banach spaces of weighted sequences. As an application example, we construct stochastic dynamics associated with Gibbs states of our particle system.},

The generalized Fourier transform, derived from the completeness relation, serves as the expansion of any Schwartz function in terms of solutions to the Lax spectral problem. We establish the completeness relations for squared solutions to the Lax spectral problem and determine the Poisson brackets between the scattering data. Action-angle variables, expressed through the scattering data, are constructed based on these Poisson brackets. It is noteworthy that the analyticity of scattering data differs from that of the AKNS-type spectral problem, necessitating adjustments to the integral paths when deriving the completeness relations. Interestingly, the conservation laws for the equation can be expressed in terms of either the spectral parameter or the potential functions, revealing the connection between the potential functions and the scattering data.},

After introducing the mathematical framework, we apply the framework to a couple of applications. The first application is related to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing gain and loss phenomena, widely considered in the context of PT -quantum mechanics. The second application is related to a finite-dimensional version of the Swanson Hamiltonian, never considered before, and addresses the problem of deriving a milder version of the RDM when exceptional points form in the system.},

This method does not target dimensionality reduction: rather, this method helps shed light on the memory-dependence of 1-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the 1-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems (H 2 and HeH + ), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the 4-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function.},

The latter problem can be viewed as optimizing positive curves on the boundary of AdS 3 space passing through n prescribed points. We observe that the answers to the two problems exhibit interesting symmetries: optimizing the Jordan curve in ∂ ∞ H 3 gives rise to a welding homeomorphism that is the boundary of a pleated plane in AdS 3 , whereas optimizing the positive curve in ∂ ∞ AdS 3 gives rise to a Jordan curve that is the boundary of a pleated plane in H 3 ⁠ .},

In uniform internally heated convection, the supply of heat equally leaves the domain entirely by conduction in the absence of a flow. When the heating, quantified by the Rayleigh number, R , becomes sufficiently large, turbulent convection ensues, reducing the heat leaving the domain through the bottom boundary. In the case of no-slip boundary conditions, with the background field method, we prove that F B ≳ R − 2 / 3 − R − 1 / 2 ⁡ log ( 1 − R − 2 / 3 ) ⁠ , up to a positive constant independent of the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. Whereas between stress-free boundaries we show that, F B ≳ R − 40 / 29 − R − 35 / 29 ⁡ log ( 1 − R − 40 / 29 ) ⁠ . We perform a numerical study of the system in two dimensions up to a Rayleigh number of 5 × 10 9 using the spectral solver Dedalus. The numerical investigations indicate that F B ∼ R − 0.092 and F B ∼ R − 0.12 for the two kinematic boundary conditions respectively.

These notions always have a graded character, since the multisymplectic forms are of a higher degree than two. Another line of work has been to extend the concept of Dirac structures to these new scenarios. In the present paper we review all these notions, relate them and propose and study a generalization that (under some mild regularity conditions) includes them and is of graded nature. We expect this generalization to allow us to advance in the study of classical field theories, their integrability, reduction, numerical approximations and even their quantization.},

The radial equation is simply related to the famous hypergeometric equation, and our work is carried out in this general setting. We find several families of infinite sets of special parameter values for which Liouvillian solutions exist, and we demonstrate how to generate these solutions recursively. The solutions are related to hypergeometric polynomials and in some cases can be constructed explicitly. For some of the families, the Liouvillian solutions exactly satisfy the boundary conditions for quasinormal modes, a fundamental set of damped, outgoing wave-functions that depend only on the background spacetime and scalar field parameters. In these families we obtain agreement with published results on the scalar quasinormal modes of the pure de Sitter spacetime. For other families, we establish conjectures regarding the factorization of the parameter constraints required for existence of Liouvillian solutions. Our results are consistent with published results on the hypergeometric equation and the well known Pöschl–Teller equation. Our new contributions are to demonstrate how to generate the hypergeometric Liouvillian solutions recursively, to completely solve the quasinormal mode problem with Liouvillian solutions, and to analyze the Liouvillian parameter constraints for the hypergeometric equation, including the case of the physical de Sitter parameters. This work contributes new knowledge to the fields of special functions and general relativity.},

  abstract     = {We study time-dependent compactification of extra dimensions. We assume that the spacetime is spatially homogeneous, and solve the vacuum Einstein equations without cosmological constant in more than three dimensions. We consider globally hyperbolic spacetimes in which almost Abelian Lie groups act on the spaces isometrically and simply transitively. We give left-invariant metrics on the spaces and solve Ricci-flat conditions of the spacetimes. In the four-dimensional case, our solutions correspond to the Bianchi type II solution. By our results and previous studies, all spatially homogeneous solutions whose spaces have zero-dimensional moduli spaces of left-invariant metrics are found. For the simplest solution, we show that each of the spatial dimensions cannot expand or contract simultaneously in the late-time limit.},

Guided by Tits-Satake graphs of real forms of the e 6 Lie algebra, we build three remarkable E 6 -higher spin black hole models: the linear-exceptional and the ortho-exceptional BTZ solutions result from splitting the extremal nodes in the E 6 6 Tits-Satake diagram while the pure exceptional-exceptional model follows from the folding down to F 4 4 ⁠ . And with the help of Hasse diagram visualizations, we study the ensuing higher spin spectrums to develop the corresponding metrics using two types of gauge transformations. For completeness, we examine the thermodynamics of the standard BTZ coupled to E 6 higher spin gravity fields by computing the partition function exploiting a one to one correspondence between the factors of the vacuum characters and the roots of the E 6 root system.},

We are particularly interested in whether multiple pairs can communicate simultaneously across a network. Quantum networks can be represented with graph states, and producing communication links amounts to performing certain quantum operations on graph states. This problem can be formulated in a graph-theoretic sense with the (Bell) vertex-minor problem. We discuss the recently introduced foliage partition and provide a generalization. This generalization leads us to a useful result for approaching the vertex-minor problem. We apply this result to identify the exact solution for the Bell vertex-minor problem on line, tree, and ring graphs.},

The quantum and classical systems share the entire eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are related one to one. When the birth rate B ( x ) and the death rate D ( x ) are chosen to be the coefficients of the difference equation governing the orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, the quantum system is exactly solvable. The eigenvectors are the orthogonal polynomials themselves and the eigenvalues are given analytically. Many examples are periodic since their eigenvalues are all integers, or all integers for integer parameters. The situation is very similar to the exactly solvable one dimensional quantum mechanical systems. These exactly solvable BD processes contain many adjustable free parameters which could be helpful for various simulation purposes.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the study of the global stability of traveling wave solutions for discrete diffusion epidemic models with nonlocal delay effects. It is easy to show that there exists a c ∗ &gt; 0 such that when the wave speed is large than or equals to c ∗ , the model admits an increasing traveling wave solution. By applying the approaches, such as the weighted energy method, the comparison principle and Fourier’s transform, we prove that all traveling wavefronts with speed c &gt; min{ c *, c ∗ }, ( c * &gt; 0), are globally stable with the exponential convergence rate t − 1 2 e − μ t for some constant μ &gt; 0.},

  abstract     = {The stabilization effect of a background magnetic field on electrically conducting fluids has attracted attention very recently, since a remarkable phenomenon was observed through physical experiments and numerical simulations. To shed light on this phenomenon, we focus on a special two-dimensional anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic equation near a background magnetic field with mixed dissipation. We study the stability problem and large time behavior of solutions. Precisely, we obtain the global stability of smooth solution for the two-dimensional nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic system in the sense of H 2 . In addition, we also establish the large time behavior with explicit decay rates to the linearized system.},

Assume a nontrivial function u solves −∇ · ( A ( x )∇ u ) = 0 in Ω, and u vanishes on Σ = ∂ Ω ∩ B for some ball B . The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the existence of a countable collection of open balls ( B i ) i such that the restriction of u to B i ∩ Ω maintains a consistent sign. Furthermore, for any compact subset K of Σ, the set difference K \⋃ i B i is shown to have a Minkowski dimension strictly less than d − 1 − ϵ . As a consequence, we prove Lin’s conjecture in quasiconvex domains.},
