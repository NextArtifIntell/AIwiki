  abstract     = {This paper proposes a real-size, single-shot, high-speed, and energy-efficient tensorized optical multimodal fusion network (TOMFuN) on an electro-photonic large-scale III–V-on-Si in-memory compute engine. The TOMFuN architecture leverages a memory-efficient and low-complexity self-attention for the embedding network for the text information and tensor-train and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decompositions for compressing the model parameters in the large-scale fully connected layers. Compared to full-size counterparts, our proposed network maintains a compatible inference accuracy in multimodal sentiment analysis tasks while requiring 92.8× fewer model parameters and 51.3× fewer hardware resources. Furthermore, the impact of photonic device imperfections on the TOMFuN architecture is investigated. The simulation results show that noise-aware on-chip training exhibits superior robustness. Finally, chip performance analysis shows that our TOMFuN inference accelerator has 230.73 PetaOps computational speed, 6.51 TOPS/W power efficiency, and 2.7 µ s latency with the input dimensions of 1024.},

The spatial distribution of the crystalline phase of an HZO film reveals that the tetragonal phase is a dominant crystal structure in the HZO film with [Zr] = 75%, resulting in anti-ferroelectric (AFE)-like double polarization switching. Analyses using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) find that the AFE-HZO capacitor effectively transforms the 3-bit time-series input into eight different reservoir output states. In reservoir computing tasks, the AFE-HZO capacitor with [Zr] = 75% achieves improved computational capacities compared with the other MFM capacitors with [Zr] = 0% and 50%. The AFE-HZO capacitor can effectively diversify time-series input signals through dynamic double polarization switching, leading to a more sub-divided and dispersive weight distribution across the adjustable weights in the readout part of our RC system.},

These resistance changes can remain for very long times or relax after a short time. Thus, memristors can be used as electronic synapses and neurons in artificial neural networks implemented in hardware. These fully memristive neuromorphic circuits are mainly intended for artificial intelligence applications. In this work, we explore the properties of a stochastic compact model for the electrical behavior of memristors in the two regimes of long-time (non-volatile) and short-time (volatile) memory for synapse and neuron functions, respectively. In the case of non-volatile memristors, we focus on potentiation/depression transients, programming energy, programming time, and power requirements for writing conductance weights in artificial network crossbars. As for volatile memristors, we consider the modeling of their behavior in the context of a leaky-integrate-and-fire neuron, demonstrating how the model captures the threshold activation function and the input signal frequency dependence.},

However, a large body of natural phenomena incorporates memory effects that are best described via fractional integro-differential equations (FIDEs), in which the integral or differential operators accept non-integer orders. Addressing the challenges posed by nonlinear FIDEs is a recognized difficulty, necessitating the application of generic methods with immediate practical relevance. This work introduces the Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equations Solver (UniFIDES), a comprehensive machine learning platform designed to expeditiously solve a variety of FIDEs in both forward and inverse directions, without the need for ad hoc manipulation of the equations. The effectiveness of UniFIDES is demonstrated through a collection of integer-order and fractional problems in science and engineering. Our results highlight UniFIDES’ ability to accurately solve a wide spectrum of integro-differential equations and offer the prospect of using machine learning platforms universally for discovering and describing dynamic and complex systems.},

These limitations include increased leakage currents, pronounced short-channel effects, and quantum tunneling through the gate oxide, leading to higher power consumption and deviations from ideal behavior. Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) can overcome these challenges by utilizing the quantum tunneling of charge carriers to switch between on and off states and achieve a subthreshold swing below 60 mV/decade. This allows for lower power consumption, continued scaling, and improved performance in low-power applications. This review focuses on the design and operation of TFETs, emphasizing the optimization of device performance through material selection and advanced simulation techniques. The discussion will specifically address the use of two-dimensional materials in TFET design and explore simulation methods ranging from multi-scale approaches to machine learning-driven optimization.},

Machine learning has been actively explored as a means to this end; however, challenges remain in terms of versatility for different tasks and device types. In this study, we explore a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach: unlike traditional reinforcement learning techniques, the learning process of MBRL progresses by constructing a model for the environment, which is to be diverted for other tasks and/or devices, thereby minimizing time-consuming learning processes. Using pre-measured data, we construct an environment model and, despite the intrinsic sparse reward distribution of the QD system, demonstrate its suitability for MBRL by emulating the process of auto-tuning to a single QD region. Our results highlight the potential of MBRL for more generic QD auto-tuning techniques, providing a promising step toward fully automated QD tuning.},

  abstract     = {Identifying reaction coordinates (RCs) is a key to understanding the mechanism of reactions in complex systems. Deep neural network (DNN) and machine learning approaches have become a powerful tool to find the RC. On the other hand, the hyperparameters that determine the DNN model structure can be highly flexible and are often selected intuitively and in a non-trivial and tedious manner. Furthermore, how the hyperparameter choice affects the RC quality remains obscure. Here, we explore the hyperparameter space by developing the hyperparameter tuning approach for the DNN model for RC and investigate how the parameter set affects the RC quality. The DNN model is built to predict the committor along the RC from various collective variables by minimizing the cross-entropy function; the hyperparameters are automatically determined using the Bayesian optimization method. The approach is applied to study the isomerization of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and in water, and the features that characterize the RC are extracted using the explainable AI (XAI) tools. The results show that the DNN models with diverse structures can describe the RC with similar accuracy, and furthermore, the features analyzed by XAI are highly similar. This indicates that the hyperparameter space is multimodal. The electrostatic potential from the solvent to the hydrogen H 18 plays an important role in the RC in water. The current study shows that the structure of the DNN models can be rather flexible, while the suitably optimized models share the same features; therefore, a common mechanism from the RC can be extracted.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, data-driven deep learning models have gained significant importance in the analysis of turbulent dynamical systems. Within the context of reduced-order models, convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) pose a universally applicable alternative to conventional approaches. They can learn nonlinear transformations directly from data, without prior knowledge of the system. However, the features generated by such models lack interpretability. Thus, the resulting model is a black-box that effectively reduces the complexity of the system but does not provide insights into the meaning of the latent features. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel interpretable CAE approach for high-dimensional fluid flow data that maintains the reconstruction quality of conventional CAEs and allows for feature interpretation. Our method can be easily integrated into any existing CAE architecture with minor modifications of the training process. We compare our approach to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two existing methods for interpretable CAEs. We apply all methods to three different experimental turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection datasets with varying complexity. Our results show that the proposed method is lightweight, easy to train, and achieves relative reconstruction performance improvements of up to 6.4% over POD for 64 modes. The relative improvement increases to up to 229.8% as the number of modes decreases. In addition, our method delivers interpretable features similar to those of POD and is significantly less resource-intensive than existing CAE approaches, using less than 2% of the parameters. These approaches either trade interpretability for reconstruction performance or only provide interpretability to a limited extent.},

By incorporating the scattering physics of x rays into the network, SAXSNN could be trained to capture the complex mapping between the SAXS patterns in reciprocal space and the corresponding morphologies in real space in an unsupervised way. We demonstrated the performance of SAXSNN on the experimental SAXS patterns of semicrystalline and amorphous polymers, i.e., hard-elastic isotactic polypropylene (iPP) films and plasticized poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB). The morphologies reconstructed by SAXSNN are well consistent with our existing knowledge of the morphology of iPP films and PVB. The developed methodology here allows us to rapidly predict the morphologies for any given SAXS pattern without any in-prior phase information and, thus, provides an intuitive understanding of the microstructures of the measured samples. A real-time feedback of the morphologies of measured samples to SAXS beamline users at modern synchrotron radiation light sources will be feasible in the near future.},

  abstract     = {In materials informatics, feature selection and model selection are utilized in the knowledge extraction process, and the confidence evaluation of the selection result is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the extracted knowledge. In this study, we propose a novel method to quantitatively evaluate the significance of low-dimensional models obtained from an expanded feature space using the density of states (DoS) for the evaluation metrics. This method allows us to compare the performance of the selected model to those of other models and evaluate its significance. We further propose an evaluation method for feature importance based on marginal posterior probabilities using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) framework, which considers all models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through their application to a crystal structure dataset. Our results show that the DoS analysis reveals the presence of a large number of models with a comparable performance with the best model reported in a previous research work. This suggests that knowledge extracted from a single selected model can be unreliable and that considering other models is crucial. We also show that the BMA-based feature importance evaluation provides valuable insights into the importance of features, highlighting both primary features and functional forms. In addition, we demonstrate that the LASSO + L0 method commonly used in existing research deteriorates the search space for model selection. Our findings suggest that our proposed methods provide valuable tools for assessing the significance of low-dimensional models and extracting knowledge from large-scale data in materials informatics.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement—so-called entanglement engineering—for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon–phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.},

This model extends previous work on the U-net model. Here we trained binary-, three-, and five-class models using supervised learning on experimentally measured dynamic fracture experiments on various opaque structural ceramic materials that were adhered on transparent polymer (polycarbonate or acrylic) backing materials. Full details of the experimental investigations are outside the scope of this manuscript, but briefly, several different ceramics were loaded using spatially and time-varying mechanical loads to induce inelastic deformation and fracture processes that were recorded at frequencies as high as 5 MHz using high-speed optical imaging. These experiments provided a rich and diverse dataset that includes many of the common fracture modes found in static and dynamic fractures, including cone cracking, median cracking, comminution, and combined complex failure modes that involve effectively simultaneous activation and propagation of multiple fragmentation modes. While the training data presented here were obtained from dynamic fragmentation experiments, this study is applicable to static loading of these materials as the crack speeds are on the order of 1–10 km/s regardless of the loading rate. We believe the methodologies presented here will be useful in quantifying the failure processes in structural materials for protection applications and can be used for direct validation of engineering models used in design.},

SRGNet integrates spatial statistics, nonlinear dynamics, graph theory, and graph convolutional networks to address these challenges. In testing, SRGNet outperformed 10 pre-trained convolutional neural networks, achieving 88% accuracy in biopsies from RT patients, with 67% accuracy for predicting survival under five years and 100% accuracy for survival over five years, along with 100% precision, an F1 score of 0.80, and an AUC of 0.73. For non-RT patients, SRGNet attained 91% accuracy, 100% precision for survival over five years, an F1 score of 0.86, and an AUC of 0.82. These results demonstrate SRGNet’s potential to enhance the precision and reliability of survival predictions in rectal cancer patients, overcoming challenges of RhoB expression variability and tumor heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional autoencoders have proven to be an adequate tool to perform reduced-order modeling for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. Their goal is to reduce dimensionality strongly while preserving the most characteristic features of the system. Here, we show that these models rely sensitively on the completeness of the provided data. This is particularly challenging for fully turbulent flows with their coherent structures ranging from large-scale superstructures to dissipative eddies over orders of magnitude in time and space. As a result, an unrealistically large number of data snapshots would be required to properly cover all the essential dynamics, whereas the features on small time and length scales require only a small number of snapshots of the respective flow, especially the long lasting large-scale structures that are difficult to characterize either numerically or experimentally. We demonstrate for three types of flows that a missing representation of large-scale turbulent structures leads to failures in the training process. We suggest a method to mitigate this shortcoming. This includes the transformation of data samples to new large-scale structures, which enhance the data. Furthermore, we skip augmentations that are more detrimental to the model performance. We evaluate our method for three datasets, two from numerical simulations of turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection flows and one from laboratory experiment for the flow past an array of cylinders. We show that the method can substantially improve model utility for high-dimensional data. In this way, we avoid an intensive grid search through possible augmentation combinations without further knowledge about the underlying system.},

  abstract     = {This research offers a new analytical tool that unravels the nonlinear relation between the parameters of Viscoelastic Damping (VD) and the resulting frequency spectrum in musical membranes. Understanding how variations in VD parameters influence the resulting sounds is crucial for developing new tools for artistic expression and for designing musical instruments with distinct sound qualities. In the case of membranophones, the external damping is well understood, while the internal damping due to viscoelastic properties of materials remains unclear. In previous research, VD in musical membranes has been modeled using a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) model. Nonetheless, analyzing the complex relationships between the large parameter space of the model and the nonlinear behavior of VD is a challenging task. This study addresses this analysis through physics-based machine learning. We employed a FDTD model of a viscoelastically damped membrane to create a physics-informed dataset, which we subsequently analyzed using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). Our findings reveal that the damping coefficient is the primary criterion when clustering the data. Furthermore, we found the internal structure of the cluster to depend on the rate of decay of the memory effect, i.e., the rate at which the energy introduced back into the system decreases. The study also demonstrates the benefits of using principal component analysis for the SOM initialization.},

A systematic survey of these and other algorithms in the nanophotonics context remains lacking. Here, we compare 24 widely used machine learning optimizers on inverse design tasks. We study two prototypical nanophotonics inverse design problems—the mode splitter and wavelength demultiplexer—across various system sizes, using both hand-tuned and meta-learned hyperparameters. We find that Adam derivatives, as well as the Fromage optimizer, consistently outperform L-BFGS and standard gradient descent, regardless of system size. While meta-learning has a negligible-to-negative impact on Adam and Fromage, it significantly improves others, particularly AdaGrad derivatives and simple gradient descent, such that their performance is on par with Adam. In addition, we observe that the most effective optimizers exhibit the lowest correlation between initial and final performance.

The hexagonal wurtzite structure, which is a typical crystal structure in compound semiconductors, demonstrates pronounced anisotropy, especially in its response to external stimuli. Recently, mechanical behavior under light illumination has attracted increasing interest especially in semiconductor compounds. In this study, we investigated the anisotropy of illumination effects on the nanomechanical properties of wurtzite ZnO. Four surface orientations—(0001), (0001) 45° off, ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ), and ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ )—were subjected to nanoindentation creep and nanoindentation hardness tests under controlled light illumination. The indentation depth during nanoindentation creep under light illumination was consistently smaller than that in darkness for all surface orientations, confirming that light suppresses indentation creep deformation, but to different degrees depending on the surface orientation. This suggests that the activated slip systems and the distribution of dislocations play a crucial role in modulating dislocation behavior under light illumination. The nanoindentation hardness followed the trend on the four surface orientations: (0001) &gt; (0001) 45° off &gt; ( ⁠ 1 1 ¯ 00 ⁠ ) &gt; ( ⁠ 2 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ⁠ ), reflecting anisotropic behavior in nanomechanical properties. Second and subsequent pop-in events were extracted, exhibiting different behaviors depending on the surface orientations, and may play a key role in determining the anisotropy in nanoindentation hardness.

  abstract     = {Passive solar heating and radiative cooling attracted lots of attention in global energy consumption reduction due to their unique electricity-free advantage. However, static single radiation cooling or solar heating would lead to over-cooling or over-heating in cold or hot weather, respectively. How to achieve effective self-adaptive thermoregulation is critical for dynamic thermal management. Hence, in this work, a self-adaptive thermoregulation strategy was designed by coupling latent heat storage or release with reversible solar heating and radiative cooling. A commercial memory alloy could realize self-adaptive thermoregulation at the critical temperature between radiative cooling with high solar reflectance R ¯ solar = 0.95 and thermal emittance ε ¯ LWIR = 0.93, and solar heating with high solar absorptance α ¯ solar = 0.92 and low thermal emittance ε ¯ IR = 0.08. High thermal conductive phase change material could further improve the thermoregulation performance with a latent heat of ∼136 J g −1 , and thermal conductivity of 3.4 W m −1 K −1 , resulting in a superior heating performance than the single solar heating (39.9 vs 36.9 °C) and superior cooling performance than the single radiative cooling (33.8 vs 35.5 °C). The maximum heating temperature increase could be 12.7 °C in the cold situation, and the temperature drop could be 8.3 °C in the hot situation. Energy consumption calculation showed that the designed sample could save 68%–90% of annual energy consumption compared with the common roof, indicating that coupling spectral regulation with the latent heat can greatly improve the self-adaptive thermoregulation performance and save the total energy consumption in thermal management.},

Solid-state thermionic energy converters (SSTECs) have been proposed as a viable alternative to VTECs since they do not require an interelectrode vacuum gap or low-work function electrodes. Nevertheless, SSTECs still require a large temperature gradient between electrodes and are limited to low operating voltages. To address these limitations, we propose a near-field enhanced solid-state thermionic energy converter (NF-SSTEC), which leverages the advantages of SSTECs by eliminating the need for a large temperature gradient between the electrodes and increasing the range of possible operating voltages. We theoretically demonstrate conversion efficiencies of 16.8 % and power densities as high as 13.1 W cm −2 without needing a high-temperature gradient between the radiator and SSTEC. Additionally, we compare its performance under different radiation spectra, showing the potential for improvement via further optimization of the radiator.},

  abstract     = {Realizing fast electron transfer and rapid mass transport in high current density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is pivotal and imperative for water electrolysis. Here, we developed Ni/NiMoN Mott-Schottky heterostructures with unique superwettability that can enhance both electron and mass transfer, greatly reducing the energy demand for water splitting. Experimental and density functional theory demonstrate that in situ grown Ni nanoparticles can optimize the dissociation of water molecules from the surface and the adsorption of H * , facilitating the hydrogen spillover process on Ni/NiMoN. The optimized electrode delivers outstanding HER performance with an ultralow overpotential of −231.3 mV at −1000 mA cm −2 and maintains stable operation for 1000 h in alkaline media. An anion-exchange membrane electrolyzer using Ni/NiMoN as cathode can achieve 1000 mA cm −2 at a low voltage of 1.93 V with superstability. Our work paves an efficient way for constructing active and robust Mott-Schottky catalysts toward industrial-level hydrogen production.},

Here, we proposed a self-aligned plasmonic-nanofluidic device, in which both nanochannel and plasmonic nanostructures are readily fabricated and self-aligned by using only one step of direct laser writing. Specifically, we use a single gold subwavelength nanochannel to simultaneously apply both spatial confinement and plasmonic enhancement. Furthermore, instead of using an ultrafast laser, we demonstrate the feasibility of drilling nanochannels on suspended substrate using continuous lasers. In contrast to conventional plasmonic nanochannels with plasmonic enhancement only under transverse magnetic (TM) mode laser, our sample presents obvious plasmonic effects under both TM and transverse electric mode lasers, which is beneficial for improving the overall signal. Our method has great potential in the widespread adoption of the plasmonic-nanofluidic system.},

This study explored the vibration of buckled graphite sheets under external excitation using experimental analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and nonlinear isotropic plate model (NIPM). Notably, multiple peaks corresponding to the identical mode appeared in the spectrum. The additional peak distinct from the natural frequency arose from transition between two steady states of the film. Remarkably, the frequency of the peak corresponding to the transition exhibited greater sensitivity to external excitations and stress than the natural frequency of the resonator did. This phenomenon opens avenues for developing 2D resonant nanomechanical sensors with enhanced sensitivity, as well as bistable nanoelectromechanical resonators.},

  abstract     = {Bulk CsPbBr 3 is an emerging semiconductor that has shown unprecedented increase in performance over the last decade for optoelectronic applications. However, further development of devices based on CsPbBr 3 is hampered by their poor electrical stability under operation. Migration and accumulation of native ions (Cs + , Pb 2+ , and Br - ) under electric fields has been suggested by many groups to be responsible for the observed device instabilities, although direct experimental evidence of ionic motion during operation has been seldom reported. In our study, ion migration has been probed by grazing incidence x-ray fluorescence (GIXRF) in CsPbBr 3 polycrystalline layers grown in vapor phase. Our findings indicate that both Cs and Br experience ionic migration under electric field, suggesting that these ions are responsible for the measured current instability in our devices. In the timescale of a few hours, the ionic drifting rates of mobile Cs and Br under the top electrode were found to be similar, as high as ∼ 20 ppm h −1 V −1 mm.

However, the tip-induced band bending (TIBB) could strongly affect the measured valence and conduction band edges, which are of vital importance for a semiconductor. In the literature, the presence or absence of the TIBB effect in a given STS measurement is often not discussed thoroughly. In this work, we quantitatively investigate the TIBB effect in MoS 2 with varying thicknesses using light-modulated contact-mode STS. Our results demonstrate that the TIBB effect is strongly dependent on the thickness of MoS 2 . With thin MoS 2 of a few atomic layers (several nanometers), the TIBB approaches zero, and the measured STS can accurately reflect the band edges. While for thicker MoS 2 of ∼100 nm, the TIBB can be as large as ∼1 eV. This work clarifies the ambiguity about the TIBB effect and provides a foundation for the interpretation of STS data on atomically thin semiconductors.},

The results indicate that sliding the upper layer of the bilayer induces charge transfer, causing polarization accompanied by periodic changes and reversal in non-polarized β -GaSe. Simultaneously, low-frequency optical phonons in polarized structures soften significantly, exhibiting a minimum or rapid decrease accompanied by the maximum value of in-plane polarization. Additionally, the sliding symmetry breaking has complex effects on phonon transport, causing intriguing changes in transport characteristics due to variations in group velocity and linewidth, which are closely related to ferroelectric polarization. This study reveals not only the polarization achieved in the β -GaSe bilayer through sliding-induced symmetry breaking but also its complex effects on phonons and profound physical changes, enriching our understanding of the associated condensed matter physics.},

The dispersion relationships between the resonant frequencies and wavelengths for the resonators, including the shear horizontal (SH) and Rayleigh modes, are investigated. The theoretical and experimental results showed that the main SH mode provides a larger coupling coefficient ( K 2 ) and that the spurious Rayleigh mode can be shifted from the passband and away from the main SH mode. Although the proposed POI SAW resonators on two different substrates have comparable frequencies for the same wavelength, the sapphire-based substrate exhibits a larger K 2 of 28% and a higher fitted Bode- Q max of 977 at 1.4 GHz. The temperature behavior of the SAW resonators is measured over a temperature range from −25 to 250 °C. The findings indicated that the resonator with the Si-based substrate has better temperature stability, with a temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of −16.99 ppm/°C and a turning point at 150 °C. In contrast, the one with the sapphire-based substrate provides a moderate TCF of −22.15 ppm/°C and remains linear for temperatures above 200 °C.

In this study, we present an alternative approach to flexoelectric-induced domain engineering in suspended two-dimensional CuInP 2 S 6 (CIPS) membranes by varying the ambient pressure. By capping CIPS over cavity holes, internal air pressurization induces bulging, which results in unique encircled domain configurations governed by local strain gradients showing upward and downward polarizations at the center and the edge of the suspended membrane, respectively. Furthermore, this domain configuration can be bidirectionally modulated by varying the ambient pressure. We demonstrate reversible variations in domain size, driven by topographic changes that redistribute the strain gradient. Our findings demonstrate that ambient pressure can be used to engineer domains in suspended ferroelectric membranes, opening avenues for the development of emerging ferroelectric devices that are sensitive to ambient pressure.},

This peak in the exponent is attributed to the interplay between equilibrium critical fluctuations and avalanche criticality. As the temperature approaches the Curie point, smaller domains and reduced polarization promote lower-energy switching, increasing the energy exponent. Near the Curie temperature, equilibrium fluctuations further modify the energy landscape, likely generating more phase boundaries and amplifying the energy exponent. Above the Curie temperature, electric field-induced phase transition dominates the switching process, where the higher energy barrier hinders switching, resulting in more energetic events and a lower energy exponent. Across all temperatures, waiting time distributions exhibit double power-law behavior, with exponents of −1 ± 0.05 for short times and −2 ± 0.10 for long times, while aftershock activity follows Omori&#39;s law with an exponent close to −1, indicating robust temporal correlations in ferroelectric domain switching. This study underscores that the avalanche dynamics of ferroelectric domain switching can be effectively modulated by temperature.},

  abstract     = {Pyroelectric energy conversion shows potential for low-grade waste heat harvesting. In this work, we design and investigate the Sr x Ba 1− x Nb 2 O 6 material at x = 0.6 (SBN60), focusing on the role of oxygen vacancies and their impacts on pyroelectric performance. By employing floating-zone synthesis with proper heat-treatment process, we systematically tune oxygen vacancies and reveal their dual effect: oxygen vacancies enhance the pyroelectric figure-of-merit, while removing oxygen vacancies extends the effective lifetime in one-charge pyroelectric energy conversion. We discover that the phase transition in a heat-treated single crystal SBN60 device helps achieve stable electricity generation for approximately 7000 cycles in 30 h with enhanced functional reversibility. The dual effect of oxygen vacancies on the coupling of pyroelectricity and effective lifetime provides a useful strategy to design high-performance pyroelectric materials, especially for one-charge pyroelectric energy conversion, offering a practical solution for real-world applications of pyroelectric devices.},

  abstract     = {Nb 2 GeTe 4 , a two-dimensional ferroelastic semiconductor, has garnered intense research interest due to its nontrivial physicochemical characteristics of high carrier mobility as well as extraordinary ferroelasticity and optical absorbance along with potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this work, the high-pressure structural, vibrational, and electrical transport properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 up to 60.0 GPa under different hydrostatic environments were systematically studied by Raman spectroscopy, electrical conductivity, and first-principles theoretical calculations. Under non-hydrostatic compression, Nb 2 GeTe 4 experienced a metallization at 11.8 GPa originating from the closure of bandgap due to the considerable compression of interlayer distance and sequential an isostructural phase transition (IPT) at 26.5 GPa. The comparable metallization pressure and the pronounced delay of IPT by ∼4.0 GPa under hydrostatic condition can be reasonably interpreted by the influence of deviatoric stress. Upon decompression, the phase transition of Nb 2 GeTe 4 was demonstrated to be reversible with the possible structural destruction under different hydrostatic environments. Moreover, Nb 2 GeTe 4 underwent a Ohmic-to-super-Ohmic conversion at 1000 mV under high pressure, which was presumably caused by the higher sinusoidal voltage than its thermal voltage. These findings enrich our foundational comprehension on high-pressure physicochemical properties of Nb 2 GeTe 4 , thereby fostering its potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

Producing such large format devices requires the use of a high throughput lithography process such as stepper photolithography. This restricts nanowire widths to the resolution limit of the photolithography system, which limits performance, particularly for mid-infrared wavelengths. In this paper, we develop an SNSPD fabrication process that uses bidirectional atomic layer etching to reduce nanowire widths by &gt; 100 nm, achieving performance that has only previously been attained using low throughput electron beam lithography. This fabrication process will allow for high-pixel count SNSPD cameras with improved performance due to reduced nanowire widths.},

Our results show that α is strongly affected by relatively mild annealing conditions ( T = 300 °C) when performed in a vacuum. This increase needs to be taken into account when obtaining the spin-mixing conductance from spin pumping measurements. We measure an increase in α by a factor of × 8 when the YIG is vacuum annealed at 300 °C. No such changes in α are observed when annealed at the same temperature in 1 × 10 −1 mbar of oxygen. We suggest that the main driver for the increase in α is the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , as demonstrated by soft x-ray magnetic spectroscopy.},

We derive a canting term based on the Thiele equation, pointing out an essential term that explains the AFM deformation depression reason. This finding also indicates that the AFM system offers superior stability for skyrmion, making it a promising choice for better option for skyrmion-based spintronics devices.},

Our results show that the magnetization ground state forms a vortex centered either on the hole or on the geometric center of the nanoring, depending on the hole&#39;s position. The observed magnetic patterns yield spin wave modes that split when increasing the ring eccentricity. The new resonant frequencies are associated with hybridized radial and azimuthal modes, which form butterfly-like patterns, which are also observed in magnetic field-driven deviations of vortices from the center of nanodots.

Rare earth (RE) metals, which are promising candidates for tuning spin transmission, can form antiferromagnetically coupled interfaces with ferromagnetic layers. In this study, we investigate the laser-induced ultrafast spin injection from permalloy (Py) into the RE metal holmium (Ho), modulated by interfacial engineering and varying the external magnetic field strength. The antiferromagnetically coupled interface between Py and Ho is confirmed by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and its correlation with spin dynamic damping is revealed by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. More importantly, we demonstrate the effective modulation of spin transmission through an external magnetic field. At the Py/Ho interface, a substantial spin-mixing conductance (SMC) of approximately 7.71 × 10 15 cm −2 is observed, which can be modulated by approximately 35% under an external magnetic field. The applied high magnetic fields are found to suppress the large SMC, primarily due to the modified sperimagnetic structure at the Py/Ho interface. These findings demonstrate the excellent spin transmission efficiency in the Py/Ho system, providing a promising approach for magneto-dynamics modulation in spintronic devices.},

Herein, a highly oriented diamond–graphene composite film (DGCF) was prepared by one-step microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition on carbon cloth (CC) using N-butylamine as a single liquid carbon source. The hybridized composition of sp 3 /sp 2 and the heat transfer path length of DGCF are regulated by the deposition temperature and the thermal conductivity of CC/DGCF at 30 °C is 2.71 W m −1 K −1 , which is 15 times higher than that of CC. Further flexible TIMs of CC/DGCF are achieved using thermal silicone grease (TG) as filler, and the thermal conductivity of the final flexible compound of CC/DGCF/TG is 6.97 W m −1 K −1 at 30 °C, which is 39 times higher than that of pure CC and 2 times higher than that of TG, respectively. In the actual TIMs performance test, the cooling efficiency is 1.4 times higher than that of the commercial thermal conductive silicone pad. Furthermore, finite element simulations demonstrated that the film at 800 °C has the optimal sp 3 /sp 2 ratio for thermal response and the best thermal conductivity path structure.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional gallium nitride (2D-GaN) has great potential in power electronics and optoelectronics. Heat dissipation is a critical issue for these applications of 2D-GaN. Previous studies have shown that higher-order phonon–phonon scattering has extremely strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ lat ⁠ ) of 2D-GaN, with the fourth-order interatomic force constants (4th-IFCs) calculated using experienced atomic displacement in the finite difference method. In this work, it is found that the 4th-IFCs of 2D-GaN are quite sensitive to atomic displacement in the finite difference method. The effects of the four-phonon scattering can be severely overestimated with non-convergent 4th-IFCs. The κ lat from three-phonon scattering is reduced by 65.6% due to four-phonon scattering. The reflection symmetry allows significantly more four-phonon processes than three-phonon processes. It was previously thought the electron–phonon interactions have significant effects on the κ lat of two-dimensional materials. However, the effects of electron–phonon interactions on the κ lat of both n -type and p -type 2D-GaN at high charge carrier concentrations can be neglected due to the few phonon–electron scattering channels and the relatively strong four-phonon scattering.},

Our investigation examines the lattice constants and electronic energy bandgaps of both the superlattice structures and alloys across different Al concentrations, shedding light on the intricate relationship between composition and electronic properties. The analysis on electronic properties reveals that as the number of Al 2 O 3 monolayers in the Al 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 superlattice rises from 2 to 6 monolayers, the bandgap correspondingly expands from 5.29 to 6.43 eV.

  abstract     = {With both piezoelectric and ferromagnetic states, two-dimensional (2D) materials have garnered significant interest due to their immense potential in the field of spintronic devices. In this paper, the stability, electronic structure, piezoelectric properties, and magnetic characteristics of 2D piezoelectric ferromagnetic semiconductor MoXF (X = S, Se) monolayers were systematically investigated through first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that both MoSF and MoSeF are stable intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors and exhibit excellent out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients ( d 31 ) of 1.05 and 1.40 pm/V, respectively, which surpass most 2D materials. They also possess out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy energy and high Curie temperatures ( T c , 227 and 210 K, respectively). In addition, biaxial strain has a significant effect on the piezoelectric properties and magnetic properties of MoSeF monolayers, which can enhance the application potential of the material. The findings suggest that MoXF monolayers hold tremendous potential for multifunctional semiconductor spintronic applications.},

Despite the important advancements shown in the literature, the B4–B1 transition boundaries have yet to be well determined due to the experiment&#39;s technical challenges, especially in the low-temperature region, resulting in a blank in the pressure–temperature ( P – T ) phase diagrams and in the absence of experimental data on the Clapeyron slopes. Here, we probe the pressure-induced B4–B1 phase transition of some typical semiconductors (ZnO, GaN, AlN, and LiGaO 2 ) at low temperatures (90–300 K) using a self-designed isothermal compression in situ Raman spectroscopy technique. We experimentally determine their B4–B1 phase boundaries at low temperature and obtain the corresponding negative Clapeyron slope parameters, with steeper slopes corresponding to larger entropy changes. Our findings provide insight into the pressure-induced B4–B1 transition in semiconductors and reveal the relationship between the bond energy and the Clapeyron slope in the B4–B1 transition.},

  abstract     = {Fully understanding and modulating the nonlinear absorption in GaN are crucial for designing ultrafast photonic devices. In this work, both the ultra-broadband transient absorption spectra and carrier recombination time in GaN were found to be significantly altered by carbon defects. An energy band model for carbon defect dynamics was established based on transient absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Our model discernibly reveals that C N and tri-carbon in GaN intricately modulate both the absorption spectrum and carrier capture process: The rapid capture of holes by the C N defect significantly reduces the hole recombination time to hundreds of femtoseconds in the near-infrared band. Conversely, the tri-carbon defect exhibited a higher absorption cross section by an order of magnitude than that of free carrier in the visible region with a long carrier recombination time. This work clarifies the modulation mechanisms of complex carbon defects in GaN&#39;s nonlinear absorption and provides scientific guidance for designing broadband and integrated ultrafast optical nonlinear devices.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are nanostructures that can enhance the performance of electronic devices due to their 3D quantization. Typically, heterovalent impurities, or dopants, are added to semiconducting QDs to provide extra electrons and improve conductivity. Since each QD is expected to contain a few dopants, the extra electrons and their parent dopants have been difficult to locate. In this work, we investigate the spatial distribution of the extra electrons and their parent donors in epitaxial InAs/GaAs QDs using local-electrode atom-probe tomography and self-consistent Schrödinger–Poisson simulations in the effective mass approximation. Although dopants are provided in both layers, the ionized donors primarily reside outside of the QDs, providing extra electrons that are contained within the QDs. Indeed, due to the quantum confinement-induced enhancement of the donor ionization energy within the QDs, a lower fraction of dopants within the QDs are ionized. These findings suggest a pathway toward the development of 3D modulation-doped nanostructures.},

Using first principles calculations, we demonstrate that the valley and spin degeneracy in the SVSiN 2 bilayer can be manipulated through different interlayer magnetic orders and stackings. Compared with its monolayer counterpart, the valley/spin polarization in the SVSiN 2 bilayer is highly tunable by electric field. Specifically, different stackings, magnetic orders, and vertical electric fields could result in various transport behaviors for the SVSiN 2 bilayer, including spin Hall current, valley Hall current, and anomalous Hall current with different valley, spin, and layer combinations. In addition, the AB and AC stacked SVSiN 2 bilayers with mirror symmetry breaking exhibit the coexistence of ferrovalley and ferroelectric polarization.

The threshold voltages (V th ) of the fabricated MIS-HEMT and MIS-FET reach 0.14 and 2.5 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the fabricated devices exhibited a high off-state breakdown voltage over 1500 V. Compared to high interface trap density (D it ) at the SiN/GaN interface of MIS-FET, a much lower D it was found at the SiN/AlGaN interface of MIS-HEMT owing to the barrier recess-free process. Thus, the MIS-HEMT exhibits a negligible V th shift tested via positive bias temperature instability, which is crucial in the practical application for the E-mode operation. Furthermore, a scheme of extracting the D it of the devices from the flatband voltages (V FB ) shift of C–V curves was developed, and the accuracy of the scheme was verified by multi-frequency C–V tests.},

A comparative investigation on the structural and electrical properties of N-implanted β -Ga 2 O 3 was conducted under different implantation temperatures and post-implantation annealing (PIA) conditions. The results showed that the high-temperature implantation (HTI) at 500 °C, compared to the room-temperature implantation (RTI), introduced fewer structural defects and less lattice distortion to β -Ga 2 O 3 . The HTI-formed CBL demonstrated a far superior current-blocking capability than those formed by the RTI with/without a PIA, in terms of a much lower and more stable leakage current and a significantly enhanced breakdown voltage. Additionally, lateral MOSFETs fabricated with the HTI isolation exhibited a three orders of magnitude lower off-state leakage current while maintaining excellent on-state performance, compared to those using the isolation formed by RTI with PIA. These findings indicate that the in situ dynamic annealing effect of HTI effectively reduces implantation-induced damage, enhances impurity activation, and improves the overall performance of the N-implanted CBLs in β -Ga 2 O 3 .},

  abstract     = {The GaN family as an electronic material and AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as electronic devices have found their widespread usage in power electronics and radio frequency (RF) applications. The threshold voltage is a crucial parameter, and application-specific threshold voltage is a requirement for this technology. A large positive threshold voltage with enhancement-mode operation is useful for power electronics. A depletion-mode transistor is used for radio frequency (RF) applications where the electron mobility is much larger in the channel region due to low interface roughness. A multi-threshold voltage transistor is a desired feature to reduce nonlinearity through compensation in RF applications. We address the issue with threshold voltage by demonstrating a programmable threshold AlGaN/GaN transistor using a dielectric stack as the charge-trapping layer. We have fabricated and characterized a triple-layer dielectric gate stack for AlGaN/GaN metal–insulator–semiconductor HEMTs. The gate stack comprises a high-k tantalum oxide sandwiched between two aluminum oxide layers. The structure is analogous to the polysilicon–aluminum oxide–nitride–oxide–silicon memory used in silicon technology. In addition to providing a large programmable threshold voltage window, the fabricated diodes reduce the gate leakage current by more than four orders of magnitude. The experimental observations are explained by the band edge alignment of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure with the dielectric stack and using a charge-trapping process by a high positive program voltage.},

This CCW phenomenon is due to the dipole formation between the a-In 2 O 3 channel and the SiO X gate insulator by relocating oxygen atoms under the influence of the applied electric field. Hence, bipolar switching of gate bias (V GS ) alters the dipole direction and leads to low (V TL ) and high (V TH ) threshold voltages. The dipole formation increases with the electric field, which can be tailored by gate oxide (SiO X ) thickness or gate bias (V GS ). Therefore, the devices with a gate oxide thickness of 200 nm initially showed the clockwise hysteresis at V GS of 2 V, transformed to the CCW (MW of 4.2 V) with an increase in gate bias to 14 V.

  abstract     = {Dual-main-phase (DMP) magnets, a promising approach for the efficient utilization of high-abundance rare earth elements, exhibit enhanced coercivity compared to single-main-phase (SMP) magnets. This study demonstrates that a DMP magnet exhibits a 43 kA/m coercivity increase over an SMP magnet of equivalent composition. Microstructural characterization reveals two main-phase grains with distinct core–shell structures in the DMP magnet. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the increased Nd content enhances the anisotropy field of the shells in Ce-rich grains, crucially contributing to the coercivity enhancement. Conversely, Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains do not significantly enhance coercivity. A micromagnetic model, constructed by substituting Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains with (Nd 0.5 Ce 0.5 ) 2 Fe 14 B grains, demonstrates a slight coercivity increase compared to the DMP magnets. Moreover, retaining only the core–shell structure in grains near the end faces maintains higher coercivity than that of DMP magnets. Experimental results of DyCoCu grain boundary diffusion show a 406 kA/m coercivity increase in the DMP magnet, less than the 510 kA/m increase in the diffused SMP magnet. Although diffusion significantly increases the anisotropy field in the shell, the core region of the Ce-rich grains maintains a low anisotropy field, limiting magnetic property enhancement. These findings underscore the critical role of an optimized core–shell structure in enhancing coercivity for Ce-rich magnets, suggesting that the DMP method may not represent the most effective strategy.},

Here, we studied the effects of heat treatments on the dimensional stability of ZTE Cu 2 P 2 O 7 /ZL101 composite (with 32 vol. % of ZL101) prepared using the pressure infiltration method. Compared with the as-cast case, after a certain heat treatment (water quenching after holding at 773 K for 1 h, then aging at 463 K for 8 h, and finally thermal-cold cycling between 463 and 77 K for three times), the dimensional stability was improved by a factor of 20 and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was highly reproducible in the subsequent temperature cycles test. The treated composite exhibits a CTE of −0.028 ppm/K at 240–305 K and a relatively high thermal conductivity of 29.5 W m −1 K −1 at room temperature, leading to a thermal distortion parameter well less than those of other ZTE materials. The improved dimensional stability and the CTE reproducibility can be attributed to the stabilization of matrix microstructure and the greatly relaxed residual stress as revealed by the analysis of 2θ-sin 2 ψ based on x-ray diffraction.},

  abstract     = {Recently, constructing three-dimensional materials through two-dimensional materials is attracting research attention in both experiment and theory due to the properties beyond ordinary 3D materials. In this work, we propose a three-dimensional carbon allotrope by interpenetrating α -graphyne sheets with van der Waals interactions and study its structural and electronic properties by first-principles calculations and tight-binding methods. Our calculations show that the energy of this interpenetrated α -graphyne is slightly lower than that of the α -graphyne nanosheet due to the weak van der Waals interactions, and its dynamical and thermodynamical stabilities are further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Remarkably, 3D interpenetrated α -graphyne is a semimetal with both Dirac nodal loops and triply degenerate nodal points near the Fermi level and the Fermi velocities at these nodal points are very high. These properties are superior to 2D α -graphyne and ordinary 3D carbon materials. Our work not only proposes a type of 3D carbon material with multiple types of fermions for carbon-based high-speed nanoelectronic devices but also shows that interpenetrating 2D materials with large hollows is a promising method for constructing 3D materials.},

A combination of HVPE and AlN substrate enabled decreasing deleterious carbon concentration and dislocation density, respectively, thus accentuating the influences of V Al -complexes on the luminescence processes. A low-temperature CL spectrum of unintentionally doped AlN exhibited predominant excitonic emissions at around 6 eV and a marginal deep-state emission band at around 3.7 eV that originates from residual carbon (&lt;10 16 cm −3 ) on nitrogen sites ( ⁠ C N ⁠ ). However, the sample was revealed to contain a considerable amount ( ⁠ ∼ 10 17 cm − 3 ⁠ ) of vacancy clusters, most likely comprising a V Al and nitrogen-vacancies ( ⁠ V N ⁠ ), namely, V Al V N 1 − 2 ⁠ , which act as nonradiative recombination centers that decrease overall CL intensity at elevated temperatures. With increasing Si-doping concentration ([Si]), major vacancy species progressively changed from V Al V N 1 − 2 to V Al O N 1 − 2 ⁠ , where O N is oxygen on N sites, which exhibit other deep-state emission bands ranging from 3.2 to 3.5 eV. Further increase in [Si] gave rise to the formation of donor-compensating defects comprising V Al and Si on the second-nearest-neighbor Al sites ( ⁠ Si Al ⁠ ), abbreviated by V Al − Si Al n ⁠ , which exhibit emission shoulders at around 2.9–3.0 eV. When [Si] exceeded 5 × 10 18 cm −3 , an emission band at around 4.5 eV emerged, which had been ascribed to originate from the nearest-neighbor Si Al C N complexes. Because V Al -complexes, including those containing impurities, are thermally stable, incorporation of vacancies should be blocked at the growth stage.},

  abstract     = {Low-dimensional materials have attracted significant attention due to their unique physical properties and broad potential applications. Antimony selenide is well known for its thermoelectric properties. However, the on-surface synthesis of chain-like structures with varying stoichiometries remains challenging. In this study, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to investigate the epitaxial growth of SbSe chain structures. With increasing deposition of Sb and Se, a transition is observed in both the structural and electronic properties, shifting from semiconducting mixed chains to metallic uniform tri-chains. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the elemental composition and helps determine the stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations show that the mixed-chain phase is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.17 eV, and that spin–orbit coupling induces band splitting. In contrast, the tri-chain phase, formed by weak van der Waals interactions between chains within the unit cell, undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal transition due to strong hybridization near the Fermi level. These findings not only provide a strategy for tuning the electronic properties of one-dimensional materials but also provide valuable insights for the design of thermoelectric and quantum materials, with potential applications in next-generation electronic devices.},

In this work, both the conventional orthorhombic and distinct cubic CoSbS compounds were facilely synthesized using the high-pressure and high-temperature method. It was found that cubic CoSbS exhibits a higher solid solubility of Ni at the Co site compared to the orthorhombic sample. The high-density point defect Ni Co in cubic CoSbS results in enhanced phonon scattering, thereby sharply suppressing phonon thermal conductivity. First-principles calculations show that the cubic structure of CoSbS exhibits higher band degeneracy and greater band dispersion compared to the orthorhombic structure, resulting in superior electrical transport properties. As a result, an enhanced figure of merit zT ∼ 0.37 was obtained at 773 K for cubic Ni 0.1 Co 0.9 SbS, which is approximately 16% higher than that of the orthorhombic sample prepared by the same method.

Here, we employ the simplified line-input crystal-encoding system representation combined with the MatterGPT framework for discovering potential piezoelectric semiconductors. By training on a curated dataset of 1556 piezoelectric materials from the Materials Project database, our model learns to generate crystal structures with targeted piezoelectric properties through an autoregressive sampling process. Starting from approximately 5000 generated structures, we implemented a comprehensive screening workflow incorporating structural validity, thermodynamic stability, and property verification. This approach identified several promising candidates from 4100 reconstructed structures, each representing compounds unrecorded in existing databases. Among these, the most notable material demonstrated a piezoelectric stress coefficient of 25.9 C / m 2 in the e[1,6] direction. Additionally, these materials demonstrate suitable bandgaps ranging from 1.63 to 3.61 eV, suggesting potential applications in high-sensitivity sensors and high-temperature electronics. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining crystal structure language encoding with generative models for accelerating the discovery of functional materials with targeted properties.},

The current technology is constrained by its reliance on complex control mechanisms and a narrow control scope, which collectively impede its practical deployment. In this Letter, we introduce an all-season smart film, a multilayer film composed of In 3 SbTe 2 (IST), CaF 2 , and ZnS on an Al substrate, which possesses the unique ability to synergistically modulate solar-thermal radiation. The solar absorptance and infrared emittance are ( a normal , ε normal ) = (0.829, 0.055) for the solar heating mode and (0.361, 0.835) for the radiative cooling mode, respectively. The underlying mechanism pertains to the Fabry–Pérot resonance and antireflection. The modulation property of the smart film remains excellent even when the incident angle is large. Furthermore, the smart film is capable of achieving multilevel modulation through the alteration of the crystalline IST percentage. The excellent modulation properties of the smart film are substantiated through a quantitative assessment of the net heat flux for terrestrial applications. This analysis reveals that the smart film with amorphous IST achieves a solar heating flux of 800 W/m 2 at 250 K, while for crystalline IST it exhibits a radiative cooling flux of 600 W/m 2 at 330 K. Such a simple multilayer structure can be easily fabricated, which would facilitate the advancement and practical implementation of an all-season smart film.},

  abstract     = {Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) is widely employed as an electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells due to its low manufacturing cost and favorable energy-level alignment. However, the suboptimal quality of TiO 2 films and the presence of multiple defects at the TiO 2 /perovskite interface, such as uncoordinated Pb 2+ and oxygen vacancy defects, significantly compromise both device efficiency and stability. This study proposes a synergistic passivation strategy through the introduction of an acetylamino-functionalized interlayer between the perovskite and TiO 2 . The acetylamino groups within the passivation layer establish strong interactions with uncoordinated Pb 2+ in the perovskite, thereby enhancing interface stability. Acetylamino groups can also interact with the TiO 2 layer by bonding with Ti 4+ and reducing oxygen vacancy defects, thereby enhancing the electron transport potential of the TiO 2 layer. The enhanced hydrophobicity of the TiO 2 film, induced by the passivation layer, further promotes perovskite crystallization by minimizing surface tension effects during film growth. Therefore, the device efficiency significantly increased from 16.49% to 19.26%. The lifetime of the unencapsulated device was evaluated under environmental conditions (relative humidity: 30% ± 5%, temperature: 25 ± 5 °C). The efficiency of the unmodified device decreased to 75.3% after 800 h, whereas the modified device maintained 90.1% of its initial efficiency, demonstrating higher stability.},

In this work, we demonstrate that the chemical activity of deposited species is crucial for determining the structure of the 3D/2D heterointerface. During pulsed laser deposition, the chemical activity of SrTiO 3 (STO) can be adjusted by controlling the oxygen partial pressure. Therefore, the relative contributions of chemical and vdW interactions at the STO/mica interface can be tuned.

At room temperature (RT), the MIS-HEMT fabricated with an atomic layer deposited (ALD)-Al 2 O 3 (MIS-HEMT B) exhibits higher maximum drain current ( I d,max ), peak transconductance ( g m,max ), and lower subthreshold slope ( SS ) and gate leakage current compared to MIS-HEMT A fabricated without ex situ Al 2 O 3 , signifying the effectiveness of the ALD-Al 2 O 3 layer to passivate severe surface states.

While the LM facilitated the handling of the droplet, LM breaks down upon squeezing, which limits the robust handling. Here, we show that LM exhibits high compression stability when the jammed particles distort the liquid surface to form sub- to single-micron roughness. We find that the particle layers&#39; distortion increases with the evaporation of the inner liquid. Thus, we regulated the evaporation degree of the droplet by varying the mixing ratio of the nonvolatile and volatile liquids. First, we show the regulation of the mixing ratio and its effect on the equilibrium LM static shape and particle layer structure. Then, the effect of the LMs&#39; surface structure on their mechanical response is explored. When 90% of the inner liquid is evaporated, the submicrometer wrinkle structure appears on the LM surface. We name the LM with the wrinkle structure “wrinkled liquid marble (WLM).” The WLM exhibited high compression stability and significantly higher resilience force than the droplet one. We believe this work helps the practical use of the LMs by improving their mechanical stability.

Excellent conformality and sub-nanometer thickness control of atomic layer deposition (ALD) make it a promising method of preparing TE thin films on flexible polymer and textile substrates suitable for sensor use. Here, Al-doped ZnO films were deposited on flexible perforated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) templates with 50/1 diethylzinc/trimethylaluminum pulsing ratio at a low temperature of 100 °C. Thermoelectric properties of the resulting nanocomposites were measured. The application potential of the present ALD-made TE coatings on flexible PET films for future roll-to-roll fabrication is discussed.},

The wavelength selectivity in the silicon metasurface corresponding to different configurations enables the GaSe film/silicon tunable metasurface heterostructure to have a response in the range of 1500–1630 nm, covering the telecommunication C and L bands. The response spectrum is derived from the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance of the metasurface structure, and the pump light and signal light correspond to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances of the metasurface structure. The high quality-factor of the quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance brought by the metasurface greatly improves the density of the electromagnetic field near the GaSe film, thus improving the sum-frequency generation conversion efficiency in the GaSe film. The pump and signal corresponding to the dual quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances introduced by the silicon metasurface are designed in the telecommunication band, while the sum-frequency light is located in the range that can be directly detected by a silicon detector. The low noise level in a silicon detector can guarantee the high sensitivity detection of shortwave infrared light. The results indicate that the upconversion detector attained a peak detectivity of 1.4 × 10 12 Jones at 1555.1 nm, comparable to commercial broadband InGaAs detectors (Thorlabs).},

Notably, the tetrafluorinated crystals, composed of fluorinated OH6FQ cations and trifluorinated anions, meet essential requirements for efficient THz wave generation, including large macroscopic optical nonlinearity, optimal facet orientation in as-grown crystals with mm-size, plate-like morphology, and relatively low THz absorption across both the entire-molecular phonon and anion-stretching vibration regions. These tetrafluorinated crystals exhibit over 20 times higher optical-to-THz amplitude conversion efficiency compared to inorganic ZnTe, with a broad bandwidth extending up to 16 THz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of tetrafluorinated ionic organic THz crystals, showing promising potential for diverse THz photonic and nonlinear optical applications.},

Unfortunately, it is unfeasible to produce brighter quantum light sources to alleviate this problem. Here, we overcome this paradigmatic limitation by developing a quantum imaging scheme that relies on the use of natural sources of light. This is achieved by performing conditional detection on the photon number of the thermal light field scattered by a remote object. Specifically, the conditional measurements in our scheme enable us to extract quantum features of the detected thermal photons to produce quantum images with improved signal-to-noise ratios. This technique shows an exponential enhancement in the contrast of quantum images. This measurement scheme enables the possibility of producing images from the vacuum fluctuations of the light field. This is experimentally demonstrated through the implementation of a single-pixel camera with photon-number-resolving capabilities. As such, we believe that our scheme opens a new paradigm in the field of quantum imaging. It also unveils the potential of combining natural light sources with nonclassical detection schemes for the development of robust quantum technologies.},

We propose an all-dielectric multilayer film metasurface to create an optical resonator and its perfectly mirrored counterpart, inducing FP-BICs and validating the conclusions. We experimentally demonstrated the evolution of the Q factor with frequency detuning, achieving a maximum Q factor of 610 in the visible.

  abstract     = {Controlling and enhancing light–matter coupling at subwavelength scales is an essential requirement in the realm of meta-photonics. Recently, all-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs) governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a standout platform for delivering high-quality (Q) factor resonances and near-field electromagnetic hotspots. However, in the terahertz (THz) domain, experimental validation of high-Q BICs resonances with strong robustness and advanced maneuverability in such all-dielectric photonic systems remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and feasible fabrication approach to unlock the full potential of BICs-inspired resonances within the array of silicon cross elliptical resonators. Our results suggest that the designed THz-MS can support two symmetry-protected BICs with a topological charge of ±1 and several accidental BICs with a topological charge of +1 simultaneously. By introducing small perturbations to the individual resonator, the original two symmetry-protected BICs transform into quasi-BICs that bow to the inverse-square law. Astoundingly, for larger symmetry breaking, two additional BICs can be observed in the asymmetric THz-MSs surpass typical inverse-square rule, hence presenting a supererogatory degree of freedom for tailoring BICs resonances on demand. We bear out theoretical findings by transmission experiments implemented on the fabricated samples. We observe experimentally ultrasharp dual quasi-BICs resonances with a highest measured Q factor of up to 371, a level of performance that was previously unattainable with all-dielectric THz-MS on a substrate. The results mark an important step toward enriching the family of BICs and promise exciting opportunities in the field of THz optoelectronic devices and metadevices.},

Among the different growth methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers high flexibility and has demonstrated the ability to produce oxide films hosting rare-earth ions with narrow linewidths. However, growing epitaxial films directly on silicon is challenging by CVD due to a native amorphous oxide layer formation at the interface. In this manuscript, we investigate the CVD growth of erbium-doped yttrium oxide (Er:Y 2 O 3 ) thin films on different substrates, including silicon, sapphire, quartz, or yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Alternatively, growth was also attempted on an epitaxial Y 2 O 3 template layer on Si (111) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to circumvent the issue of the amorphous interlayer. We found that the substrate impacts the film morphology and the crystalline orientations, with different textures observed for the CVD film on the MBE-oxide/Si template (111) and epitaxial growth on YSZ (001). In terms of optical properties, Er 3+ ions exhibit visible and IR emission features that are comparable for all samples, indicating a high-quality local crystalline environment regardless of the substrate. Our approach opens interesting prospects to integrate such films into scalable devices for optical quantum technologies.},

However, the bulky nature of Ga 2 O 3 limits its application in miniaturized, integrated and multifunctional devices, and polarization imaging based on Ga 2 O 3 photodetector has not yet been realized. Here, we report a convenient method to prepare 2D β-Ga 2 O 3 flakes via liquid-metal-assisted exfoliation. Benefiting from high crystallinity and polarization-sensitive absorption of prepared ultrathin β-Ga 2 O 3 flake in monoclinic structure, the β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetector exhibits an ultra-fast response speed (100/78 μ s for rise/decay time) and a prominent anisotropy ratio (∼2.8) of polarization photoresponse under 265 nm illumination. An unambiguous detection of linearly polarized light has also been realized by the double symmetry-breaking of twisted β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetectors. Moreover, a four-layer twistedly stacked detection system further enables a one-step and well-defined polarization imaging with high resolution (150 × 150 pixels) to acquire spatial polarization information. This work presents a novel strategy for preparing ultrathin 2D gallium oxides and demonstrates a promising route to realize well-defined solar-blind polarization imaging in a simple manner.},

Here, we demonstrate a significant shift of ferromagnetic resonance spectra in ferromagnetic films placed between two superconductor gating layers. Through deliberate modifications of the interface structure using various insertion layers, we have determined that the superconducting proximity effect has a minimal impact on the modulation of ferromagnetic resonance characteristics. Instead, our findings strongly support very recent theoretical predictions that emphasize the phenomenon of ultrastrong coupling between Kittel magnons and Cooper pairs arising from the superconducting magnetoelectric effect. We propose that this ultrastrong coupling not only provides a precise method for determining superconducting parameters like the London penetration depth but also lays the foundation for the manipulation of spin waves through superconductors in future magnonic circuits.},

  abstract     = {Optogenetics with high temporal and spatial resolution hold great potentials to replace the traditional drug and electrical stimulation techniques, which calls for optical probing devices with low crosstalk and organic damages. Here, we report a fabrication method of optoelectrical probes for precise modulation of neurons. A linear array of flip-chipped green resonant-cavity μ LEDs (RCLED) with an emitting aperture of 50 μ m is integrated on Si platform as the stimulation source. Due to the top/bottom Bragg reflectors, the RCLEDs&#39; output light view-angle is narrowed to &lt;90°. The emission wavelength demonstrates remarkable stability under various injection current densities. Under the 50 A/cm 2 driving current density, the RCLEDs&#39; output optical density is 100 mW/mm 2 and maximum temperature rise is 0.5 °C, both of which exhibit great improvement compared with those of the optical probes on sapphire substrate. Using these green RCLED probes to stimulate Mac-mCherry photosensitive protein, the analgesia and inhibition effects for medium prefrontal cortex GABAergic neurons are verified. This work provides an effective approach to fabricate integrated microscale light sources for precise stimulation and modulation of neurons, which facilitate the study of complex neural functions.},

  abstract     = {As an effective method for thermal management technologies, doping or substitution has been extensively utilized to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of various materials. Intensive studies have been conducted about the phonon mechanism of isoelectronic alloying since the 1950s. Very recently, the specific role of aliovalent doping was elucidated in the half-Heusler NbFeSb system. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally investigated the mechanism of reducing thermal conductivity through aliovalent doping by combining first-principles calculations and neutron diffraction studies for the case study of the TiCoSb half-Heusler system. The softening of the acoustic branches induced by aliovalent doping can effectively reduce the phonon group velocities. Moreover, the introduction of compensating defects, resulting from changes in the Fermi level, plays a vital role in decreasing the relaxation time of phonons, as demonstrated by the analysis of neutron powder diffraction. Due to these two factors, doping with adjacent elements results in a significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity (for instance, Ni doping at the Co site in the TiCoSb half-Heusler system), especially in the low-temperature range. Our findings provide valuable insight into the phonon scattering mechanism in aliovalent-doped materials and demonstrate the role of compensating defects in heat transport, which is applicable to other doped semiconductor systems.},

By integrating x-ray-guided wireless manipulation with UMRs, we aim to address challenges associated with precise and controlled blood clot intervention. The untethered nature and size of these robots enhance maneuverability and accessibility within complex vascular networks, potentially improving clot removal efficiency. We explore mechanical fragmentation, chemical lysis, and hybrid dissolution techniques that combine mechanical fragmentation with chemical lysis, highlighting their potential for targeted and efficient blood clot removal. Through experimental validation using an ex vivo endovascular thrombosis model within the iliac artery of a sheep, we demonstrate direct revascularization of a 13-mm-long, 1-day-old blood clot positioned inside the left common iliac artery. This was achieved by deploying a UMR into the abdominal aorta within 15 min. Additionally, both mechanical fragmentation and hybrid dissolution achieve a greater volume rate of change compared to no intervention (control) and chemical lysis alone. Mechanical fragmentation exhibits clot removal with a median of 0.87 mm 3 /min and a range of 2.81 mm 3 /min, while the hybrid approach demonstrates slower but more consistent clot removal, with a median of 0.45 mm 3 /min and a range of 0.23 mm 3 /min.},

  abstract     = {Phototransistors have great application prospects in automotive vehicle, smart home, healthcare, imaging, and display. However, so far, there has been no report of flexible phototransistors that simultaneously achieve both high mobility and detectivity. Additionally, phototransistors are conventionally relied on thick channel layers and previous thin channel layers based devices only show poor performance. Here, we report flexible phototransistors based on ultrathin niobium-doped indium oxide (InNbO, 5 nm)/indium tin oxide (ITO, 3 nm) channel layers, which possess high mobility (49.21 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and high detectivity (3.02 × 10 14 Jones) simultaneously. Significantly, the devices offer a broad spectral responsivity (from violet to green emissions). We postulate that the high mobility can be ascribed to the diffusion of Sn atoms (from ITO) and conduction band offset (between InNbO and ITO), while the high detectivity originates from the low dark current. To illustrate the capabilities of flexible phototransistors, we demonstrate both a flexible active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display pixel circuit and an imaging system. Our approach unlocks new possibilities to achieve flexible phototransistors with superior performance, which suggest a great potential in next-generation flexible, stretchable, bendable, and low-cost electronics.},

  abstract     = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a prominent branch of non-linear optics (NLO) heavily reliant on conventional bulk NLO crystals. However, the difficulty in downsizing these crystals imposes technical limitations on the future of miniaturized NLO devices. Tellurene emerges as a promising candidate to overcome these restrictions, excelling in electrical applications and believed to possess a giant second-order optical susceptibility comparable to conventional NLO crystals. In this study, a face-to-face substrate configuration is employed for the synthesis of ultrathin tellurene via PVD. Our findings reveal that tellurene&#39;s SHG performance surpasses that of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides by two orders of magnitude, with maximum efficiency when the flake thickness is between 16 and 20 nm under various wavelengths. High sensitivity to thickness variation encourages post-growth thinning through hydrogen plasma etching, enabling precise engineering of the flake thickness for optimal SHG. This establishes a foundation for controlled tellurene thickness, further broadening its potential in diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {The band alignment (BA) between two materials is a fundamental property that governs the functionality and performance of electronic and electrochemical devices. However, despite decades of study, the inability to separate surface properties from those of the bulk has made a deep understanding of the physics of BAs elusive. Building on the theory of the ideal vacuum level to separate surface from bulk [Choe et al. , Phys. Rev. B 103 , 235202 (2021)], here we present a geometric theory for the band alignment, specifically explaining the insensitivity of the alignment to interfacial orientation between isotropic materials. First, we adopt a neutral polyhedron, termed Wigner-Seitz atoms (WSA), to partition the charge of atoms in a way that maintains crystal symmetry and tessellates the space. In contrast to the CWZ theory, the band alignment of two materials constructed from such WSAs is independent of interface orientation. Upon electron relaxation at the interface, we show that the interfacial charge transfer dipole can be accurately described by the sum of localized point dipoles that exist between atoms at the interface (bond dipoles). For interfaces between isotropic materials, the magnitude of the bond dipole can be factored out as a multiplier, leaving only geometric factors, such as crystal symmetry and dimension of the material, to determine band alignment, regardless of the orientation of the interface. We considered 29 distinct interfaces and found that this bond dipole theory yields excellent agreement (RMS deviation &lt; 30 meV) with first-principles results. Our theory can be easily applied to interface between alloys, as well as between anisotropic systems.},

For the first time, we have successfully achieved significant regulation of ABMR through the application of gate voltage. Our quantified analysis reveals a profound link between the tunable anisotropy in Rashba spin splitting and the precise modulation of the Fermi level filling, highlighting its central role in governing gate-modulated ABMR. Additionally, we introduce a rigorous physical model that provides a deep and nuanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying gate-voltage-controlled ABMR.

Despite more than half a century of study, unraveling the underlying transport physics within this space has been nontrivial due to the complex electronic structure, disorder, and small bandgap within these alloys. Furthermore, as Peltier coolers, Bi 1− x Sb x alloys operate in a bipolar regime; as such, understanding the impact of minority carriers is critical for further improvements in device performance. This study unites first principles calculations with low-temperature experimental measurements to create a generalized model for transport within semiconducting Bi-Sb alloys. Our exploration reveals the interplay between the complex, degenerate valence band structure with the extremely light conduction bands. By building a hybrid computational/experimental model, an understanding of both the electron and hole relaxation times emerges both as a function of temperature and energy. Special quasi-random supercell calculations reveal that, despite significant atomic disorder, the electronic band structures within the alloy remains largely unaffected and electron–phonon scattering dominates. For charge carriers near the band edges, the relaxation times are thus extremely long, consistent with cyclotronic behavior appearing at low magnetic fields ( ⁠ ≪ 1 T). Modeling thermoelectric performance suggests that the valence band edge deformation potential is significantly weaker and highlights the potential for p -type compositions to meet or exceed the current n -type alloys.},

  abstract     = {As a wide bandgap semiconductor, diamond holds both excellent electrical and thermal properties, making it highly promising in the electrical industry. However, its hole mobility is relatively low and dramatically decreases with increasing temperature, which severely limits further applications. Herein, we proposed that the hole mobility can be efficiently enhanced via slight compressive shear strain along the [100] direction, while the improvement via shear strain along the [111] direction is marginal. This impressive distinction is attributed to the deformation potential and the elastic compliance matrix. The shear strain breaks the symmetry of the crystalline structure and lifts the band degeneracy near the valence band edge, resulting in a significant suppression of interband electron–phonon scattering. Moreover, the hole mobility becomes less temperature-dependent due to the decrease of electron scatterings from high-frequency acoustic phonons. Remarkably, the in-plane hole mobility of diamond is increased by ∼ 800 % at 800 K with a 2% compressive shear strain along the [100] direction. The efficient shear strain strategy can be further extended to other semiconductors with face-centered cubic geometry.},

  abstract     = {This study utilized co-sputtering to fabricate Mo-doped VO 2 films and identified an optimal concentration exhibiting a lower phase transition temperature (T h = 55.8 °C) and a broader hysteresis window ( ⁠ Δ T = 13.6 °C). At the atomistic scale, it is demonstrated that Mo dopant-induced localized strain accelerates the phase transition, which leads to the relaxation of the tetragonal structure. Furthermore, the effects of Mo doping on the phase transition process and electrical properties are characterized at the nanoscale using conductive atomic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy, and the potential application in selectors can be evaluated. The results indicated that Mo doping destabilizes the M1 phase by introducing a high density of electrons, thereby significantly reducing the electron–electron interactions as per the Mott model. Moreover, the device exhibited stable threshold and memristive properties at room temperature, quickly switching from high to low-resistance states at a threshold voltage of 2.37 V and maintaining stability over more than 1000 cycles with a selectivity &gt;10 2 . The present work not only highlights the role of Mo doping in enhancing the functional properties of VO 2 but also demonstrates its feasibility in high-performance selectors devices.},

  abstract     = {In response to the challenges posed by traditional computing architectures in handling big data and AI demands, neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising alternative inspired by the brain&#39;s efficiency. This study focuses on three-terminal synaptic transistors utilizing graphene and P(VDF-TrFE) to achieve dynamic reconfigurability between excitatory and inhibitory response modes, which are crucial for mimicking biological functions. The devices operate by applying different top gate spikes (±25 V and ±10 V) to modulate the polarization degree of P(VDF-TrFE), thereby regulating the carrier type and concentration in the graphene channel. This results in the effective realization of enhancement and inhibition processes in two neural-like states: excitatory and inhibitory modes, accompanied by good neural plasticity with paired-pulse facilitation and spike-time-dependent plasticity. With these features, the synaptic devices achieve brain-like memory enhancement and human-like perception functions, exhibiting excellent stability, durability over 1000 cycles, and a long retention period exceeding 10 years. Additionally, the performance of the artificial neural network is evaluated for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 92.28%. Our study showcases the development of highly stable, dynamically reconfigurable artificial synaptic transistors capable of emulating complex neural functions, providing a foundation for emerging neuromorphic computing systems and AI technologies.},

Although these applications are dependent on the optical performance, the origin of the optical absorption in electrochromic oxides is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that the electrochromism of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides can be described by a combination of polaron and bipolaron hopping. Based on the valences of the metallic constituents, we model experimental optical absorption spectra by polaron theory and assign two prominent absorption peaks to polaronic and bipolaronic charge transfer excitations. However, in the special case of V 2 O 5 , three peaks were necessary to fit the optical spectra. The activation energies of polaronic and bipolaronic hopping were remarkably similar for all the cathodic oxides studied. Within the framework of polaron absorption, V 2 O 5 would be categorized as a cathodic oxide, rather than as a mixed anodic/cathodic material as in the conventional picture. We emphasize that our findings here not only offer a profound understanding of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides but also pave the way for exploring electrochromic oxides with dual-band modulations.},

Furthermore, our observations and characterizations of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in the respective phases of the VO 2 film offer valuable insight into their electron structures. This investigation enhances comprehension of the MIT mechanism in correlated systems and underscores the roles of polarons, lattice distortions, and electron correlations in facilitating phase transition processes in strongly correlated systems.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional materials with multiple degrees of freedom, including spin, valleys, and orbitals, open up an exciting avenue for engineering multifunctional devices. Beyond spintronics, these degrees of freedom can lead to novel quantum effects such as valley-dependent Hall effects and orbital magnetism, which could revolutionize next-generation electronics. However, achieving independent control over valley polarization and orbital magnetism has been a challenge due to the need for large electric fields. A recent breakthrough involving pentalayer rhombohedral graphene has demonstrated the ability to individually manipulate anomalous Hall signals and orbital magnetic hysteresis, forming what is known as a valley-magnetic quartet. Here, we leverage the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity of pentalayer rhombohedral graphene to develop nonvolatile memory and in-memory computation applications. We propose an architecture for a dense, scalable, and selector-less nonvolatile memory array that harnesses the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity. In our designed array architecture, nondestructive read and write operations are conducted by sensing the valley state through two different pairs of terminals, allowing for independent optimization of read/write peripheral circuits. The power consumption of our PRG-based array is remarkably low, with only ∼6 nW required per write operation and ∼2.3 nW per read operation per cell. This consumption is orders of magnitude lower than that of the majority of state-of-the-art cryogenic memories. Additionally, we engineer in-memory computation by implementing majority logic operations within our proposed nonvolatile memory array without modifying the peripheral circuitry. Our framework presents a promising pathway toward achieving ultra-dense cryogenic memory and in-memory computation capabilities.},

Apart from overcoming issues of fluidic damping and electrical interfaces, there is a great challenge of bringing microanalytes to these devices with the required precision and scaling for high throughput sensing. Herein, we address the above challenges by proposing a self-excited localized acoustic manipulation methodology based on a piezoelectric micromechanical diaphragm resonator (PMDR). Such a PMDR integrates acoustofluidics and mass sensing functions in tandem on a single device. Particle enrichment is realized within tens of seconds and the limit of detection is enhanced by mitigating common issues such as low capture rate and non-uniform distribution. The developed PMDR is versatile in its applicability to a range of particle sizes and densities for both acoustofluidic actuation and in situ mass sensing. This work addresses long-term technical challenges of inaccurate and inefficient measurement of liquid phase resonance mass sensing with great application potentials in biochemical detection and environmental monitoring.},

The complexities of several metamaterial architectures are discussed. A new classification system is proposed to distinguish metamaterial configurations based on the typology of the channels inside the acoustic meta-atom. Several types of acoustic metamaterials architectures, such as perforated and micro-perforated panels, acoustic foams, resonators, various geometrical paths, and piezoelectric patches, are also discussed. The fundamental acoustic mechanisms of these classes of metamaterials are identified and commented on. The paper also describes the main measurement techniques used for acoustic metamaterials and the physical quantities evaluated, providing a guide to characterize and assess their performance.

The efficiency of light-emitting materials has been improved significantly through the understanding of their emission mechanisms. However, the correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the operating voltage in OLEDs remains unclear, because OLEDs require a complex multilayer configuration that includes many materials other than the emitter. It is difficult to investigate the exact energy diagram for OLEDs, which have many interfaces, and many uncertainties remain regarding the mechanisms of charge injection and recombination. In this review, we introduce both the charge injection and recombination mechanisms in OLEDs and the interface control technology effective for lowering their operating voltage. We explain the electron injection mechanism at organic/cathode interfaces, which is clarified by using organic bases as the electron injection layers. The hole injection mechanism in OLEDs, which is clarified by investigating the correlation between the characteristics of OLEDs and the actual energy levels at organic/anode interfaces, is also introduced. With the elucidation of the charge injection mechanism, holes and electrons can now be injected into various organic materials. These charge injection techniques minimize the voltage required for charge recombination. The correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the minimum voltage required for OLED operation is clarified by controlling the energy levels at organic/organic interfaces. Understanding this correlation enables the design of molecules for ultralow-voltage OLEDs, thereby realizing blue OLEDs with an extremely low turn-on voltage of about 1.5 V.},

These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light–matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits.

  abstract     = {Smart biomaterials have significantly impacted human healthcare by advancing the development of medical devices designed to function within human tissue, mimicking the behavior of natural tissues. While the intelligence of biomaterials has evolved from inert to active over the past few decades, smart biomaterials take this a step further by making their surfaces or bulk respond based on interactions with surrounding tissues, imparting outcomes similar to natural tissue functions. This interaction with the surrounding tissue helps in creating stimuli-responsive biomaterials, which can be useful in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, autonomous drug delivery, orthopedics, and much more. Traditionally, material engineering focused on refining the static properties of biomaterials to accommodate them within the body without evoking an immune response, which was a major obstacle to their unrestricted operation. This review highlights and explains various engineering approaches currently under research for developing stimuli-responsive biomaterials that tune their outcomes based on responses to bodily factors like temperature, pH, and ion concentration or external factors like magnetism, light, and conductivity. Applications in soft and hard tissue engineering, 4D printing, and scaffold design are also discussed. The advanced application of microfluidics, like organ-on-a-chip models, extensively benefits from the intrinsic smart properties of biomaterials, which are also discussed below. The review further elaborates on how smart biomaterial engineering could revolutionize biosensor applications, thereby improving patient care quality. We delineate the limitations and key challenges associated with biomaterials, providing insights into the path forward and outlining future directions for developing next-generation biomaterials that will facilitate clinical translation.},

Recent advancements in both direct and indirect 3D bioprinting offer promising solutions to construct complex vascular networks by allowing precise control over cell and extracellular matrix placement. The process from shape printing of microvasculature to function formation involves dynamic shift of bioink mechanical properties, mechanical microenvironments, and mechanobiology of endothelial and supporting cells. This review explores how biomechanical and mechanobiological principles are integrated into the bioprinting process to develop functional microvascular networks. Before printing, a top-level design approach based on these principles focuses on the interactions among biomaterials, cell behaviors, and mechanical environments to guide microvascular network fabrication. During printing, biomechanical design of bioinks for different bioprinting techniques, along with optimized biomechanical factors of bioprinting process, ensures accurate microvascular structure reproduction while maintaining cell viability. After printing, the emphasis is on creating a suitable mechanical environment to modulate the mechanobiology of multiple steps of neovascularization, including initiation, morphogenesis, lumen formation, stabilization, and maturation of functional microvasculature. Finally, we discuss future developments based on biomechanical and mechanobiological design to drive the bioprinting of functionalized microvascular networks.},

  abstract     = {The advent of artificial intelligence—deep neural networks (DNNs) in particular—has transformed traditional research methods across many disciplines. DNNs are data driven systems that use large quantities of data to learn patterns that are fundamental to a process. In the realm of artificial electromagnetic materials (AEMs), a common goal is to discover the connection between the AEM&#39;s geometry and material properties to predict the resulting scattered electromagnetic fields. To achieve this goal, DNNs usually utilize computational electromagnetic simulations to act as ground truth data for the training process, and numerous successful results have been shown. Although DNNs have many demonstrated successes, they are limited by their requirement for large quantities of data and their lack of interpretability. The latter results because DNNs are black-box models, and therefore, it is unknown how or why they work. A promising approach which may help to mitigate the aforementioned limitations is to use physics to guide the development and operation of DNNs. Indeed, this physics-informed learning (PHIL) approach has seen rapid development in the last few years with some success in addressing limitations of conventional DNNs. We overview the field of PHIL and discuss the benefits of incorporating knowledge into the deep learning process and introduce a taxonomy that enables us to categorize various types of approaches. We also summarize deep learning principles which are critical to PHIL understanding and the Appendix covers some of the physics of AEMs. A few specific PHIL works are highlighted and serve as examples of various approaches. Finally, we provide an outlook detailing where the field is currently and what we can expect in the future.},

Na 1+ x Zr 2 Si x P 3− x O 12 (NaSICON) SEs have recently regained attention for applications in both solid-state and aqueous redox flow batteries due to their improved electrochemical and mechanical properties, along with their inherent electrochemical stability, air robustness, and low manufacturing cost. Recent improvements in NaSICON have primarily targeted macroscopic property enhancements and synthesis techniques. To enable further breakthroughs in the performance of NaSICON SEs, future efforts should focus on understanding how modified synthesis conditions influence atomic and microscopic-scale features, such as conduction channels, electronic structures, phase distributions, and grain boundaries. These features ultimately control ion conductivity, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability of NaSICON and its interfaces. Here, we review the current understanding of the structure-chemistry-property relationships of NaSICON SEs, focusing on atomic and microscopic levels. First, we introduce the proposed ionic conduction mechanisms in NaSICON crystallites. Then, we explore experimental investigations at phase and grain boundaries to assess ionic conduction and interfacial stability. We also examine strategies to address interfacial challenges such as high resistance and chemical reactions between SEs and electrodes, highlighting the difficulties in analyzing interfaces at the nano/atomic scale.

  abstract     = {Nuclear energy emerges as a promising and environmentally friendly solution to counter the escalating levels of greenhouse gases resulting from excessive fossil fuel usage. Essential to harnessing this energy are nuclear batteries, devices designed to generate electric power by capturing the energy emitted during nuclear decay, including α or β particles and γ radiation. The allure of nuclear batteries lies in their potential for extended lifespan, high energy density, and adaptability in harsh environments where refueling or battery replacement may not be feasible. In this review, we narrow our focus to nuclear batteries utilizing non-thermal converters such as α- or β-voltaics, as well as those employing scintillation intermediates. Recent advancements in state-of-the-art direct radiation detectors and scintillators based on metal perovskite halides (MPHs) and chalcogenides (MCs) are compared to traditional detectors based on silicon and III-V materials, and scintillators based on inorganic lanthanide crystals. Notable achievements in MPH and MC detectors and scintillators, such as nano-Gy sensitivity, 100 photons/keV light yield, and radiation hardness, are highlighted. Additionally, limitations including energy conversion efficiency, power density, and shelf-life due to radiation damage in detectors and scintillators are discussed. Leveraging novel MPH and MC materials has the potential to propel nuclear batteries from their current size and power limitations to miniaturization, heightened efficiency, and increased power density. Furthermore, exploring niche applications for nuclear batteries beyond wireless sensors, low-power electronics, oil well monitoring, and medical fields presents enticing opportunities for future research and development.},

These perturbations locally disturb the entire symmetry of crystals, resulting in symmetry breaking. Oxides, in particular, exhibit intriguing properties when subjected to defects, which can lead to significant modifications in their structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Such defects in non-magnetic oxides can induce magnetic symmetry breaking, leading to the formation of emergent magnetic domains and orderings.

In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing PDs with flexible form factors and using eco-friendly materials and approaches. These efforts have resulted in exploration of degradable materials and printed electronics as a resource-efficient route for manufacturing and to contain end-of-life issues.

The advantages and disadvantages of various bottom-up and top-down methods explored to realize the nanostructures and the wet (solution-processable) and dry printing and assembly methods to print the nanostructures on flexible substrates, are discussed along with their suitability for various applications. This discussion is supported by a comparative analysis of printed PDs in terms of key performance metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, I Light /I Dark ratio, response speed, and external quantum efficiency.

  abstract     = {Quantum states of light, such as fixed photon number (Fock) states, entangled states, and squeezed states, offer important advantages with respect to classical states of light, such as coherent states and thermal states, in different areas: they enable secure communication and distribution of encryption keys, enable realization of sensors with higher sensitivity and resolution, and are considered candidates for quantum computing and simulation applications. To accommodate these applications, suitable methods for generating the quantum states are needed. Today, the quantum states are often produced by a spontaneous nonlinear process in a standard nonlinear material, followed by a series of optical elements necessary for encoding the desired state on the generated photons. In this review, we consider an alternative approach of structuring the nonlinearity of the crystal so that the desired quantum state will be generated directly at the crystal, without the need for additional elements. Our main focus here is on bulk crystals having structured second-order nonlinearity. The rising interest in these nonlinear metamaterials is fueled by advancements in the ability to efficiently simulate and design spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) processes, as well as by new capabilities of structuring the nonlinearity of ferroelectric crystals, either by electric field poling or by laser-induced writing. As a result, nonlinear metamaterials were recently used to directly shape the spatial and spectral correlations of quantum light that is generated in SPDC. The paper covers the theoretical background and the design and fabrication methods of bulk nonlinear metamaterials for generating quantum light, as well as a series of demonstrations of the use of metamaterials in quantum optical applications.},

  abstract     = {Graphene has been one of the most investigated materials in the last decade. Its unique optoelectronic properties have indeed raised it to an ideal and revolutionary candidate for the development of entirely novel technologies across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from the microwaves to the x-rays, even crossing domain of intense application relevance, as terahertz (THz) frequencies. Owing to its exceptionally high tensile strength, electrical conductivity, transparency, ultra-fast carrier dynamics, nonlinear optical response to intense fields, electrical tunability, and ease of integration with semiconductor materials, graphene is a key disruptor for the engineering of generation, manipulation, and detection technologies with ad hoc properties, conceived from scratch. In this review, we elucidate the fundamental properties of graphene, with an emphasis on its transport, electronic, ultrafast and nonlinear interactions, and explore its enormous technological potential of integration with a diverse array of material platforms. We start with a concise introduction to graphene physics, followed by the most remarkable technological developments of graphene-based photodetectors, modulators, and sources in the 1–10 THz frequency range. As such, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for a broad audience, ranging from novices to experts, who are keen to explore graphene physics for conceiving and realizing microscale and nanoscale devices and systems in the far infrared. This would allow addressing the present challenging application needs in quantum science, wireless communications, ultrafast science, plasmonics, and nanophotonics.},

Consequently, various strategies aimed at enhancing sensing performance have emerged, with the introduction of morphological structures into the active layer being the most effective. In light of this, capacitive tactile sensors based on morphological structure designs have gained favor among researchers, gradually forming a “hundred schools of thought contend” trend. Nevertheless, the processes and applicability of morphological structures have yet to form a complete system, and the development and intelligence of morphological-engineering-based capacitive tactile sensors have reached a bottleneck stage, requiring a comprehensive and systematic review to provide inspiration for breakthroughs. This review delves deeply into the impact of various morphological structure designs on device performance and provides a comprehensive overview of the applicability, advantages, and disadvantages of morphological structure fabrication technologies derived from these structures.

However, its intrinsic algorithm limitations and high computational costs for large-scale systems generate gaps between experimental observations and calculation simulation, restricting the accuracy and efficiency of electrocatalyst design.

So, to realize these devices, an extensive study, from fundamental physics to practical applications, becomes essential. In this article, we present an exhaustive review of the advancements in understanding the fundamental physics behind magnetic skyrmions and the novel data storage and computing technologies based on them. We begin with an in-depth discussion of fundamental concepts such as topological protection, stability, statics, and dynamics essential for understanding skyrmions, henceforth the foundation of skyrmion technologies. For the realization of CMOS-compatible skyrmion functional devices, the writing and reading of the skyrmions are crucial. We discuss the developments in different writing schemes such as STT, SOT, and VCMA. The reading of skyrmions is predominantly achieved via two mechanisms: the magnetoresistive tunnel junction TMR effect and topological resistivity. So, a thorough investigation into the skyrmion Hall effect, topological properties, and emergent fields is also provided, concluding the discussion on skyrmion reading developments. Based on the writing and reading schemes, we discuss the applications of the skyrmions in conventional logic, unconventional logic, memory applications, and neuromorphic computing, including a model of a skyrmion-based SNN architecture achieving over 90% accuracy on MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets. Furthermore, we outline the potential of skyrmion-hosting Majorana zero modes in emerging topological quantum computation and helicity-dependent skyrmion qubits.},

Among these materials, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been widely investigated in CO 2 reduction and water splitting to produce chemical fuels. However, pure LDHs suffer from sluggish charge-carrier transport, a great electron–hole recombination rate as well as tend to cause agglomeration. Due to the aforementioned bottlenecks, numerous modification techniques have been considerably explored to enhance the potential of LDHs toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 photoreduction. Therefore, this article presents a thorough review of developments made for the construction and modification of LDH photocatalyst properties aiming to enhance water splitting and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The review starts with the techniques adopted to synthesize LDH-based structures toward enhanced structure and morphology. The key semiconducting, optical, and electronic properties are studied to understand the conduct of LDH materials toward excellent photocatalytic material. The study then deliberates the techniques such as morphological engineering, hybridization with conducting and semiconducting materials, vacancy creation and defect engineering, components tuning, photothermal catalysis, heterojunction, and heterostructural engineering employed for the enrichment of photocatalytic properties. The study also discusses the steps taken to enhance the adsorption of LDHs and coupling of computational and operando techniques toward semiconducting, structural, and optical properties to investigate the best-performing photocatalysts. The study also reviews the recent advancements of LDH for applications toward water splitting and CO 2 conversion.},

Conventional analytical methods often fall short in comprehensive EV molecular profiling, necessitating innovative approaches for enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. This review focuses on the utilization of nanoplasmonic structures for optical signal detection of EVs, exploring advancements, challenges, and future prospects toward single EV molecular profiling. Nanoplasmonic structures offer enhanced optical readout capabilities, leveraging light iridescence, and plasmonic amplification suitable for the size range and complexity of the EVs. We delve into the research and implications of on-chip methods, shedding light on EVs&#39; role in health and disease. Despite notable progress, opportunities still exist to further develop nanoplasmonic arrays, customizing them for bioanalytes of interest, crucial for both label-free and labeled techniques to attain the objectives of their EV profiling. One such example is the use of specific antibodies for surface functionalization in nanoplasmonic arrays. Other approaches involve tailoring the design of platforms to the physical properties of target EVs, thereby enhancing characterization capabilities. The subsequent sections will cover a curated selection of relevant studies. We later discuss EV analysis through plasmonic nanoarrays in clinical sample scenarios. While patterning methods, such as colloidal self-assembly and e-beam lithography, enable integration with microfluidic systems, facilitating future investigations, few technologies have entered clinical trials. This roadblock highlights the need for further development of cost-effective, detailed molecular profiling methods. Moreover, we discuss avenues like single EV profiling and machine learning to address challenges related to heterogeneity of EVs as liquid biopsy biomarkers. Finally, we discuss future opportunities in developing nanoplasmonic-assisted EV profiling and studied their driving advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic realms, such as customizable nanoplasmonic structures coupled with artificial intelligence analysis modules, as a path forward for precise EV molecular profiling, which may enable personalized therapeutic interventions.},

The presence of two novel functionalities, i.e., direct and converse ME couplings, makes them ideal candidates for multifunctional devices such as energy harvesters, magnetic field sensors, ME random access memories, and ME antennas. In these ME composites, ME coupling is strongly dependent on the superior physical properties of the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials. Therefore, magnetostrictive materials with excellent piezomagnetic coefficients and piezoelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric coefficients are required to achieve a large ME coupling. Among the various piezoelectric materials, ferroelectric relaxor-PbTiO 3 (PT) single crystals have been used extensively as piezoelectric constituents because of their ultrahigh piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Furthermore, the domain structure and crystal orientation of the relaxor-PT single crystals exhibit extraordinarily large piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Owing to these multifunctional properties, relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites have been widely used for studying direct and converse ME couplings in ME composites in recent years. Relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites show excellent ME coupling, e.g., the highest ME voltage coefficient, equivalent magnetic noise, and output power of 7000 V cm − 1 Oe − 1 @ 23.23 kHz, 6 pT/√Hz @1 Hz, and 19 mW @ 60 Hz, respectively, which are one of the best-reported values in ME composites so far.

  abstract     = {Developing reliable and efficient single-photon sources is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, relying on nonlinear frequency conversion or spontaneous emission from individual quantum emitters. While different types of single-photon sources excel in specific applications, none meet all criteria for an “ideal” source: exceptional brightness, high purity, and indistinguishability. To address this challenge, coupling single-photon emitters with designer nanostructures can significantly enhance emission performance, a pivotal area in quantum nanophotonics. This review summarizes recent advancements over the past decade in generating and manipulating single photons, emphasizing the pivotal role of nanostructure coupling. Single-photon emission systems—such as nonlinear crystals, solid-state defects, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and two-dimensional materials—are categorized quantitatively based on their ability to achieve high purity, indistinguishability, and brightness, presented in a three-dimensional technology map. Furthermore, nanostructure engineering is showcased for manipulating properties such as emission direction, polarization, chirality, and entanglement of single photons. By elucidating these critical aspects, this review aims to advance understanding of how advancements in nanostructured environments promise to shape the future of single-photon generation and manipulation within quantum nanophotonics.},

  abstract     = {Phase transitions are fundamental phenomena in physics that have been extensively studied owing to their applications across diverse industrial sectors, including energy, power, healthcare, and the environment. An example of such applications in the energy sector is thermal energy storage using phase change materials. In such systems, and indeed in many other thermal systems, an emerging and promising approach involves the use of nanoparticles, which have been extensively studied for their potential to enhance the performance of thermal systems. However, conducting thermodynamic analyses of thermal systems in the presence of nanoparticles proves to be complex and resource-consuming because of the involvement of many parameters, including (i) temperature, molecular structure, and composition of the host fluid in which nanoparticles are either dispersed or in physical contact; (ii) nanoparticle morphology, size, type, and concentration; and (iii) complex interactions between the nanoparticles and the base fluid. This article reviews recent studies on the role of nanoparticles in phase transition processes such as freezing, melting, boiling, evaporation, and condensation. It begins with an overview of phase transition phenomena without nanoparticles, emphasizing the most important controlling parameters, and then examines the underlying physics of nanoparticle-involved phase transitions, critically examining their impact on process speed (transport rates). The article also explores physical phenomena, such as Brownian motion, thermophoresis, microconvection, and nanoparticle agglomeration, and considers their contribution to rate control (enhancement or reduction). Finally, the article presents challenges, research gaps, and suggestions for future exploration, aimed at offering a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between the presence of nanoparticles and the phase transition processes.},

While significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying droplet generation in microchannels and in fabricating devices to produce droplets with varied functionality and high throughput, challenges persist along two important directions. On one side, the generalization of numerical results obtained by computational fluid dynamics would be important to deepen the comprehension of complex physical phenomena in droplet microfluidics, as well as the capability of predicting the device behavior. Conversely, truly three-dimensional architectures would enhance microfluidic platforms in terms of tailoring and enhancing droplet and flow properties. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and additive manufacturing (AM) promise unequaled opportunities for simulating fluid behavior, precisely tracking individual droplets, and exploring innovative device designs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in applying AI and AM to droplet microfluidics. The basic physical properties of multiphase flows and mechanisms for droplet production are discussed, and the current fabrication methods of related devices are introduced, together with their applications. Delving into the use of AI and AM technologies in droplet microfluidics, topics covered include AI-assisted simulations of droplet behavior, real-time tracking of droplets within microfluidic systems, and AM-fabrication of three-dimensional systems. The synergistic combination of AI and AM is expected to deepen the understanding of complex fluid dynamics and active matter behavior, expediting the transition toward fully digital microfluidic systems.},

  abstract     = {Electrokinetic energy harvesting (EKEH) has emerged as a promising renewable and carbon-neutral energy source for small and large-scale applications, reducing the reliance on conventional fossil fuels and providing innovative solutions for remote, off-grid applications. The underlying mechanism of EKEH relies on the movement of dissolved electrolytes over charged fluid–solid interfaces through confinements resulting in the generation of useful power. The low energy conversion efficiency typically observed in larger (micrometer) confinements can be substantially mitigated by shifting to nanometer and sub-nanometer regimes. This down-scaling unlocks high selectivity and provides unique opportunities to potentially harness Angstrom-scale interactions to maintain and elevate fluid permeability. However, EKEH at sub-nanometric scales remains fraught with considerable challenges in fabrication, economic viability, scaling of power, and maintenance, significantly impeding its advancement. In this review, we detail the electrokinetic processes that drive energy conversion in the presence of pressure, concentration, and temperature gradients. We examine the key factors affecting conversion efficiency and explore the innovative solutions in the recent literature addressing associated challenges. Additionally, we highlight the role of novel nanomaterials and specialized geometries along with new fabrication techniques that enable high permeation without sacrificing selectivity in nanometer and sub-nanometer confinements. Finally, we delve into the major obstacles that EKEH currently faces to reach its full potential of extracting clean and affordable energy and conclude by offering insight into future developmental directions and potential breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.},

Normally, it has been utilized for its insulation properties, for example, in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. However, it also can be considered as a wide bandgap semiconductor possessing very large electrical resistivity. The conductivity of various silica films has been studied since the mid-nineteenth century, usually assuming the presence of ionic conductivity. However, in the sense of a wide bandgap semiconductor, the temperature dependence of the resistivity, which ranges over more than four orders of magnitude, can be accurately explained by normal semiconductor behavior under the presumed presence of a deep electron trap/donor residing ∼2.3 eV below the conduction band edge. That is, the conductance is determined by electron motion and not by ions. Experiments have studied the transport of injected electrons (and holes) which are consistent with this viewpoint.},

In recent years, there has been a surge in research on polarization-sensitive photodetectors that utilize anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) materials. The essence of these 2D polarization-sensitive photodetectors is rooted in the anisotropic characteristics that arise from the asymmetric crystal lattice of the 2D materials in question. This anisotropy is manifested in both optical and electrical behaviors due to the asymmetrical nature of the crystal structure. This article systematically categorizes anisotropic 2D materials and offers an insightful overview of their crystal structures. It also introduces various optical and electrical characterization techniques designed to elucidate the anisotropic properties of these materials. The focus of the article then shifts to detailing the current state of research in the realm of anisotropic 2D material-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors. It provides a comprehensive description of the working principles behind polarization-sensitive photodetectors with different structural designs, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that enable their polarization sensitivity. In conclusion, the article summarizes the findings of this review, highlighting the advancements and challenges in the field.

The use of two strategies of spin labeling of mRNAs allowed us to study for the first time the effect of the structure and location of spin labels on the measured interspin distances in human ribosome complexes. Experiments using dipolar EPR spectroscopy, supported by molecular dynamics calculations, demonstrated that labels introduced at nucleotide bases provide a higher resolution between mRNA conformations in the ribosome mRNA channel, compared to labels introduced at the ribose-phosphate backbone. Although ribose-phosphate labeling turned out to be less informative on its own for studying mRNA conformations in the ribosome than the previously used base labeling, it can find application in other complex studies of the structure of RNAs and their complexes.},

  abstract = {The elasticity of phospholipid membranes as a function of hydration was investigated using coarse-grained molecular simulations. Multilamellar membranes consist of two or more lipid bilayers separated by a thin layer of water, a system commonly found in cell membranes that provides surface tension in the alveoli of the lungs and on cartilaginous surfaces of synovial joints. The objective was to quantify the response of such systems to compression in the direction perpendicular to the membranes as a function of the amount of water between the bilayers or hydration of the system. The present study investigated a variety of phospholipids with six levels of hydration found in multilamellar bilayers in biological systems. Our simulations support the existence of a universal behavior of the increase in surface area per lipid as a function of the normal pressure difference, the difference between the pressure applied in the direction normal to the membrane and the pressure applied in the directions parallel to the membrane. Normalizing the surface area per lipid and the pressure difference by their respective values at rupture yields a composite function of two linear regimes for all the hydration levels under investigation. Where possible, a physics-based interpretation of the normalization scales was provided. Although some parameters of the model are determined empirically, the model represents a promising step in continuum modeling of the response of multilamellar lipid membranes as a function of mechanical stress and hydration.},

  abstract = {The localization of biomolecular condensates to intracellular membrane surfaces has emerged as an important feature of sub-cellular organization. In this work, we study the wetting behavior of biomolecular condensates on various substrates. We use confocal microscopy to measure the contact angles of model condensates formed by intrinsically disordered protein Ddx4 N . We show the importance of taking optical aberrations into account, as these impact apparent contact angle measurements. Ddx4 N condensates are seen to partially dry (contact angles above 90°) a model membrane, with little dependence on the magnitude of charge on, or tyrosine content of, Ddx4 N . Further contact angle measurements on surfaces of varying hydrophilicity reveal a preference of Ddx4 N condensates for hydrophobic surfaces, suggesting an intrinsic repulsion between protein condensates and hydrophilic membrane surfaces. This observation is in line with previous studies relating protein adsorption to surface hydrophilicity. Our work advances the understanding of the molecular details governing the localization of biomolecular condensates.},

These models serve as valuable frameworks for understanding self-organization in biological polymers and synthetic materials. At low activity, all models exhibit similar behavior; as activity increases, subtle differences emerge in intermediate regimes, but at high activity, their behaviors converge. Adjusting for differences in mean active force reveals nearly identical behavior across models, even across varying filament configurations and bending rigidities. Our results highlight the importance of force definitions in active polymer simulations and provide insights into phase transitions across varying filament configurations.},

A rich array of ordered structures can be formed from XLCMs, driven by the competition between the interactions between the chemically distinct blocks and the molecular connectivity. Here, we report a theoretical study on the phase behavior of XLCMs with symmetric and asymmetric side blocks by using the self-consistent field theory (SCFT). A large number of ordered structures, including smectic phases, simple and giant polygons, are obtained as solutions of the SCFT equations. Phase diagrams of XLCMs as a function of the total length and asymmetric ratio of the side chains are constructed. For XLCMs with symmetric side blocks, the theoretically predicted phase transition sequence is in good agreement with experiments. For XLCMs with a fixed total side chain length, transitions between layered structure to polygonal phases, as well as between different polygonal phases, could be induced by varying the asymmetry of the side chains. The free energy density, domain size, side chain stretching, and molecular orientation are analyzed to elucidate mechanisms stabilizing the different ordered phases.},

S086 has two crystalline forms (α and ξ) with the same molecular composition, but only the crystal structure of the latter has been disclosed. Using the carboxylic group (COO − ) and the amide group (CONH) as structural probes, the core structures and local dynamics of the Ca 2+ coordination complex in the unit cell of the two cocrystals were examined by ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy. A notable variation in the molar ratio of bidentate to bridging binding types of COO − groups that bind to Ca 2+ was first identified between the two crystal forms by linear IR spectroscopy. This variation is accompanied by greater local structural rigidity of the α-crystal compared to that of the ξ-crystal, as evidenced by a greater residual amplitude in the spectral diffusion dynamics extracted from the time-dependent 2D IR spectroscopy. Vibrational energy transfer between the bidentate and tridentate COO − groups in the α-crystal was found to be faster than that in the ξ-crystal, suggesting shorter intermolecular distances between EXP3174 and sacubitril in the former. These findings provide dynamical structural parameters that help to understand the stability and releasing mechanisms of the drug molecules.},

We attribute this to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial relaxation. We also characterize the dependence of liquid and vapor densities on the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system, displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave fluctuations.},

To address this problem, this study pioneers the application of deep operator networks to effectively model the time-dependent piezoionic effect. By leveraging a data-driven approach, our model significantly reduces computational time compared to traditional finite element analysis (FEA). In particular, we trained a DeepONet using a comprehensive dataset generated through FEA calibrated to experimental data. Through rigorous testing with step responses, slow-changing forces, and dynamic-changing forces, we show that the model captures the intricate temporal dynamics of the piezoionic effect in both the horizontal and vertical planes. This capability offers a powerful tool for real-time analysis of piezoionic phenomena, contributing to simplifying the design of tactile interfaces and potentially complementing existing tactile imaging technologies.},

The results show that near-perfect nonreciprocity can be obtained with an extremely small magnetic excitation on the order of 0.2 T, which could be reached with permanent magnets.

  abstract = {Condensed phase explosives typically contain defects such as voids, bubbles, and pores; this heterogeneity facilitates the formation of hot spots and triggers decomposition reaction at low densities. The study of the thermal decomposition mechanisms of explosives at different densities has thus attracted considerable research interest. Gaining a deeper insight into these mechanisms would be helpful for elucidating the detonation processes of explosives. In this work, we developed an ab initio neural network potential for the FOX-7 system using machine learning method. Extensive large-scale (1008 atoms) and long-duration (nanosecond timescale) deep potential molecular dynamics simulations at different densities were performed to investigate the effect of the density on the thermal decomposition mechanism. The results indicate that the initial reaction pathway of the FOX-7 explosives is the cleavage of the C–NO 2 bond at different densities, while the frequency of C–NO 2 bond cleavage decreases at higher density. Increasing the initial density of FOX-7 significantly increases the reaction rate during the initial decomposition and the formation of final products. However, it leads to a decrease in released heat and has minimal impact on the decomposition temperature. In addition, by analyzing the molecular dynamics trajectories and conducting quantum chemical calculations, we identified two lower-barrier production pathways to produce the CO 2 and N 2 .},

  abstract = {The most efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently developed using antisolvent-based fabrication technology. Despite extensive analysis of various aspects of the antisolvent method—such as the type of antisolvent, dropping time, and precursor compatibility—some antisolvents still produce uneven film surface morphology on centimeter-scale substrates. The decoupling of the relationship between local structural characteristics, such as grain boundaries and defects, and the optoelectronic performance of PSCs is currently one of the most highly regarded research issues in the field. In this study, we utilized high-resolution white light interferometry to characterize the morphological distributions of perovskite films from the center to edge, using anisole as an example of the antisolvent. We observed that macro cracks at the center of the film typically exhibit dense ridge morphology, while cracks toward the edges display a concave morphology. We analyze the stress mechanism by using EDS mapping and AFM in detail, attributing this phenomenon to the competitive attachment of 2D islands and boundaries for adatoms, which are influenced by changes in grain size. The devices at different locations were fabricated and their performance analyzed. Our findings indicate that these protruding cracks do not significantly affect the current and voltage of the photovoltaic device; however, concave cracks lead to a decrease in the device fill factor. We attribute this decrease to enhanced carrier recombination at the interface due to this morphology. This study provides valuable insights into the formation of perovskite film morphology under antisolvent treatment and the relationship between film local morphology and PSCs performance.},

  abstract = {The traditional Gouy–Chapman–Stern theory has been effective in explaining the behavior of dilute electrolytes in the electrical double layer but falls short when it comes to describing how ions behave at the metal/electrolyte interface. This is because it overlooks key factors such as the molecular structure of water at the interface and the effects of electron screening in the metal. To address these gaps, we revisit ion adsorption at the metal/electrolyte interface. The approach combines the method of images with a field-theoretic framework for dilute electrolytes and metals described by the Thomas–Fermi model. Nonlocal polarization correlations in water are described by a first-order gradient expansion in the Landau free energy functional. Unlike earlier approaches that relied on the “specular reflection approximation,” our method provides a less constrained way to handle the complex electrostatic boundary conditions at the interface. Analyzing the behavior of a test charge near the interface, an electrostatic energy minimum is found. This minimum depends on the metal’s screening properties and the overall potential drop across the double layer. In addition, the alignment of water dipoles at the interface creates an asymmetry in the energy experienced by positively and negatively charged ions. Finally, we derived an expression for the electrosorption isotherm by describing both the distribution of the electrostatic potential and the lateral interactions between charges along the interface. Our findings highlight how the structure of interfacial water can drive processes such as underpotential deposition by creating favorable electrostatic conditions for ion adsorption.},

The solid state route is adopted to prepare these dilute weight% ( x = 1, 3, and 5) ferrite based composites. The incorporation of ferrite phase improves the interfacial tensile strain and grain boundary volume fraction in the said composite. The incommensurate to commensurate magnetic transition (T N2 ) of YBaCuFeO 5 is shifted to a high temperature by 10 K with the lowest concentration and indistinguishable in higher concentrations due to the magnetic dominance of ferrites. The irreversibility of magnetization due to the field history mostly stems from the uncompensated spins and a competitive interaction among the magnetic phases at the interface. The magnetic isotherms show unusual negative exchange bias phenomena in the said system, and a large room temperature spontaneous exchange bias (∼1 kOe) is achieved with a dilute incorporation x = 5. The exchange bias field and coercive fields (H C ) are, however, contrary to each other with temperature (and concentration) explained with a schematic model on the basis of dominating irreversible spins at high temperatures. In a field of ±50 kOe, the exchange bias field is dropped, while H C is increased, which might be due to the dominance of Zeeman energy over the uniaxial anisotropy. The non-collinear magnetic phase transition of YBaCuFeO 5 at T ≤ 175 K plays a pivotal role in reducing the exchange bias compared to its collinear phase (300 K). Moreover, the extent of this bias field (∼1 kOe) can be considered a useful component in efficient device fabrication.},

We find that the hopping-site energy distributions inferred from the amorphous structures deviate from the Gaussian distribution, especially in their low-energy tails. Mostly for this reason, the effect of disorder on charge-carrier mobility is much weaker than predicted by the lattice/Gaussian models and dependent on system density. The lattice models of electron–hole recombination in disordered systems, which assume a Gaussian site energy distribution, are found to be more accurate than those of charge-carrier transport. This is explained by the strong Coulomb trapping of electron–hole pairs before recombination, which makes the role of hopping-site energy disorder less significant.},

Validation of this relation was structured at different levels, taking into account various ingredients as the apolar–polar character, macromolecular structure, the presence of hydrogen bonds, or complex structure and dynamics. The results reclaim the suitability of dielectric spectroscopy to echo the primary structural relaxation of glass-forming systems, demonstrating that the dielectric response effectively captures the structural relaxation by reliably correlating with entropy fluctuations. The correlation with entropy fluctuations holds even when the dielectric strength of the systems is high and the dielectric response is narrow and dominated by cross correlations, proving that dipolar intermolecular interactions are fundamental to the structural relaxation and not a particularity of the dielectric probe. This one-to-one correspondence between structural and dielectric α relaxation does not support the existence of a generic spectral shape for the primary structural relaxation valid for all kinds of susceptibility functions.},

In this study, we employ a deep neural network trained on density functional theory data to investigate the dielectric properties of liquid water at room temperature across a pressure range of 0.1–1000 MPa. We observe a nonlinear increase in the static dielectric constant ɛ 0 with increasing pressure, a trend that is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. This increase in ɛ 0 is primarily attributed to the increase in water density under compression, which enhances collective dipole fluctuations within the hydrogen-bonding network as well as the dielectric response. Despite the increase in ɛ 0 , our results reveal a decrease in the Kirkwood correlation factor G K with increasing pressure. This decrease in G K is attributed to pressure-induced structural distortions in the hydrogen-bonding network, which weaken dipolar correlations by disrupting the ideal tetrahedral arrangement of water molecules.},

  abstract = {The structural effect of inserting large central rings into a two-dimensional network of three-coordinate nodes is investigated using a ring-growth Monte Carlo procedure. The size of the central ring is systematically varied, as is the inherent level of disorder in the surrounding network (as controlled by the Monte Carlo “temperature” and characterized by the fraction of six-membered rings). The effect of the central ring on the overall network topology is analyzed in terms of both topological and geometric distances. For larger central rings, the first topological shell becomes exclusively populated by four- and five-membered rings, which leads to an effective upper limit on the size of the central ring that can effectively be accommodated. The topological shells are found to show ordering at significant distances away from the central ring. The effective correlation lengths are determined as a function of both central ring size and level of network disorder, which allows for an understanding of the potential density of large rings that may be accommodated.},

  abstract = {Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) are environmentally friendly green solvents and hold great promise in the pharmaceutical industry. The secondary structure of a protein, lysozyme, follows a non-monotonous behavior in aqueous glyceline (choline chloride + glycerol) as the wt. % of water is increased. However, it is unclear how the hydration affects the stability of the protein in a non-linear way. In this work, we have performed all-atom molecular dynamic simulations for 1 μ s with the lysozyme protein in an aqueous glyceline deep eutectic solvent (DES) by varying the wt. % of water. The simulated radius of gyration, R g , values can qualitatively reproduce the protein behavior such that the R g increases initially with an increase in wt. % of water, reaches the peak at 40 wt. %, and then gradually decreases with dilution. Several other properties, including root mean square deviation, root-mean square fluctuation, secondary structure of the protein, and solvent accessible surface area, are examined to explore the NADES effect on the protein structure. Next, we analyze the hydrogen bond profile of intra-protein and among various interspecies, e.g., protein–DES, DES–DES, protein–water, and water–water. The variation in protein–protein hydrogen bonds with concentrations can qualitatively explain the non-linear conformational dependence of the protein. The radial distribution function analyses show various microscopic structures formed due to the DES and water interaction, which play a critical role in protein behavior. This study indicates that at lower wt. % of water, the protein is constrained in a strong hydrogen bond network formed by glycerol and water molecules, resulting in a lower R g . As the wt. % of water increases, the protein–water interaction drives the protein to expand, reflecting an increasing R g . At sufficiently higher wt. % of water, the DES constituent and the water molecules interact strongly with the protein, resulting in a decrease in R g . Overall, the investigation offers a microscopic insight into the protein conformation in DES.},

We find that such networks self-organize to a marginally stable state, in which the barrier for local activations becomes vanishingly small. The model provides unique access to both local and global properties associated with marginal stability. We directly measure pseudo-gaps in the spectrum of local excitations, as well as diverging fluctuations under shear. Crucially, the dynamics are dominated by a small population of bonds that are locally unstable, which give rise to quasi-localized, low-frequency vibrational modes and scale-free avalanches of instabilities. We propose a correction to the scaling between the pseudo-gap exponent and avalanche statistics based on diverging length fluctuations. Our model combines a coarse-grained view with a continuous, real-space implementation, providing novel insights to a wide class of amorphous solids.},

We employ polarized quasi-elastic neutron spectroscopy to investigate the perturbation to the hydrogen bond network of water–ethanol mixtures induced by a supramolecular gel network and by paracetamol (PCM) molecules. Interestingly, while the supramolecular gelator significantly alters the macroscopic behavior of the solvent at concentrations of 0.3 and 0.5 wt. %, it does not affect the hydrogen bond network at the microscopic level. In contrast, the addition of PCM at 5 wt. %, which does not change the macroscopic properties, modifies the structural dynamics of water–ethanol mixtures at length scales commensurate with and below the PCM–PCM correlation length in the mixture. This study reveals the intricate interplay between solute, solvent, and gel interactions, demonstrating a lack of direct correlation between macroscopic and microscopic properties in such complex systems.},

  abstract = {The lack of a well-defined equilibrium reference configuration has long hindered a comprehensive atomic-level understanding of liquid dynamics and properties. The Instantaneous Normal Mode (INM) approach, which involves diagonalizing the Hessian matrix of potential energy in instantaneous liquid configurations, has emerged as a promising framework in this direction. However, several conceptual challenges remain, particularly related to the approach’s inability to capture anharmonic effects. In this study, we present a set of “experimental facts” through a comprehensive INM analysis of simulated systems, including Ar, Xe, N 2 , CS 2 , Ga, and Pb, across a wide temperature range from the solid to gas phase. First, we examine the INM density of states (DOS) and compare it to the DOS obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function. We then analyze the temperature dependence of the fraction of unstable modes and the low-frequency slope of the INM DOS in search of potential universal behaviors. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between INMs and other properties of liquids, including the liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover and the momentum gap of collective shear waves. In addition, we investigate the INM spectrum at low temperatures as the system approaches the solid phase, revealing a significant fraction of unstable modes even in crystalline solids. Finally, we confirm the existence of a recently discussed cusp-like singularity in the INM eigenvalue spectrum and uncover its complex temperature-dependent behavior, challenging current theoretical models.},

To understand this unusual feature, we have measured the responses to high amplitude ac and dc electric fields at the fundamental frequency. The static limits of these results are entered into a model aimed at reproducing nonlinear dielectric susceptibility spectra using the concept of a fictive electric field. This model reproduces the “hump” in the third-harmonic response and its seeming disappearance. It is revealed that the “hump” is predominantly the result of reduced time constants, a consequence of the energy the sample absorbs from the electric field. At elevated temperatures, the “hump” only appears to vanish because its reduced amplitude submerges below the extraordinarily high level of polarization saturation of this liquid.},

  abstract = {This study delves into the fragmentation mechanisms of the oxazolone form (OXA) of protonated cyclo-di-glycine using chemical dynamics simulations at multiple internal energies. While we focus our in-depth analyses on a representative total energy of 178 kcal/mol, we also performed simulations over the 127–187 kcal/mol range. This broader energy sampling reveals how the population of states evolves with increasing internal energy, enabling us to compute rate constants and then effective energy thresholds using a previously introduced three-state model [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. By transforming molecular geometries into graph representations, we systematically analyze fragmentation processes and identify key intermediates and ion–molecule complexes (IMCs) that play a crucial role in fragmentation dynamics. The study highlights the distinct isomerization landscapes of OXA, driven by IMC formation, which contrasts with the previously reported behavior of cyclic and linear forms [Perez Mellor et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 124103 (2021)]. The resulting fragmentation channels are characterized by their unique energetic thresholds and branching ratios and can provide a molecular explanation of what was observed experimentally. Thanks to an accurate analysis of the trajectories using our graph-theory-based tools, it was possible to point out the particular behavior of OXA fragmentation, which is different from other isomers. In particular, the important role of IMCs is shown, which has an impact on populating different isomeric structures.},

Eight rotationally resolved excitation spectra were observed in 17 800–23 650 cm −1 , allowing the determination of the vibrational frequencies and rotational constants for the ground and five highly excited electronic states. Six low-energy Ω states below 3500 cm −1 were identified from the SVL emission spectra and assigned to six spin–orbit components of the X 3 Σ − and A 3 Π electronic states. Furthermore, high-level ab initio calculations were performed on numerous Λ − S and Ω electronic states to support the assignments from the experimental observations. The spectral results elucidate the bonding characteristics of PdO and provide support for verifying the significant relativistic effect on the bonding of PtO.},

The measured kinetic energy releases are in general agreement with AIMD simulations, and the deduced amount of energy transfer into the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom of CO 2+ is about 3 eV less than that estimated by the Coulomb potential.},

For the dimer [(2,2′-bpy) 2 Ag] 2 2+ , qualitative electrostatic potential, non-covalent interaction, atoms-in-molecules analyses, and quantitative energy decomposition analysis calculations indicate that the electrostatic repulsion between two like formal charges at silver centers can be overcome by long-range dispersion attraction and short-range electronic correlation from ligands. In addition, delocalizing the net charges on silvers over the whole ligands can decrease electrostatic repulsion of metal centers to stabilize oligomers. The vital role of the screening effect of solvent has also been realized in the bound binding of the title system. Overall, this research highlights the importance of ligand stacking to argentophilicity, while d 10 –d 10 attraction of silver centers presents quite little contribution.},

  abstract = {Electron spin resonance indicates that the unpaired electron in the methanol radical cation is delocalized, however, the molecular geometry has not been experimentally resolved. In this work, high level, state-of-the-art computations at the finite temperature density functional theory and highly correlated CCSD(T) levels indicate that a syn -periplanar conformation of the H–C–O–H bonds, in which the C–H and O–H bonds eclipse each other, is a three-fold global minimum in the potential energy surface for internal rotation of the O–H bond. We show that vicinal hyperconjugation between the orbitals in the C–H bonds and in the oxygen atom is responsible for this puzzling conformational preference. The transition state for the rotation yields an ≈ 0.6 kcal/mol rotational barrier, which matches the thermal energy at room conditions and, therefore, renders the O–H bond a free rotor. The molecular wave function has a moderate multireference character with the oxygen atom acting as the preferred spot for static correlation.},

Our group recently synthesized a series of end-to-end bent perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophanes, whose degree of bending is adjustable by modifying the internal alkyl tethers. Herein, we subjected these bent PBI derivatives to theoretical calculations and time-resolved spectroscopy. The current study has offered rational explanations for several unique photophysical characteristics of bent PBIs: (1) the redshifts of the S 0 –S 1 transitions, (2) the decrease in extinction coefficients, (3) the broadening of spectral shapes, and (4) the suppression of nonradiative decay processes. Furthermore, the investigation of the S 1 states and radical anions has revealed that structural bending also substantially alters the energy levels of upper molecular orbitals such as LUMO+2.},

The binary cluster features a linear B 3 chain along its C 3 axis, as well as three lateral Zn–Zn dimers, in which a central B atom is sandwiched by two quasi-planar BZn 3 units in an eclipsed form. Chemical bonding analyses show that the B 3 chain motif has Lewis-type B–B σ single bonds and a pair of orthogonal three-center two-electron (3c-2e) π bonds, collectively leading to a B–B bond order of two. Stabilizing a boron single chain is scarce in the literature, as is observing a series of double B=B bonds in a monoatomic chain fashion. The triangular pyramid BZn 3 units are each in a unique triplet σ 2 σ* 1 σ* 1 configuration, thus rendering σ aromaticity to the cluster according to the reversed 4 n Hückel rule. It is proposed that the alloy cluster can be rationalized using the concept of electronic transmutation, wherein a close chemical analogy to the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) molecule is established.},

In this study, indium-doped silicon clusters (InSi n −/0 , n = 3–11) were investigated using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional calculations. It is found that InSi n − anions exhibit geometrical and electronic structures resembling their Si n+1 counterparts, with the substitution of one silicon atom by an indium atom leading to exohedral doping and multiple coordination characteristics. The exohedral configuration is attributed to a weak In–Si bond and the limited atomic valence of indium, while the multiple coordination arises from the joint contributions of three orthogonal 5 p orbitals of indium atom. Electronic structure similarities between InSi n − anions and Si n+1 clusters are confirmed by their identical valence molecular orbitals. The valence p -type orbitals of InSi n − primarily contribute to chemical bonding, whereas the valence s -type orbitals predominantly hold electron lone pairs, as demonstrated by the electron localization function and localized molecular orbital analysis. These results provide insights into the structural and electronic properties of indium-doped silicon clusters.},

  abstract = {Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flips, and magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange–correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn–Sham (KS) and generalized KS (GKS) orbitals, the KS potentials, and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze seven standard exchange–correlation functionals and find two main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, as well as the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential, when using the optimized effective potential method within the KS scheme. When calculations are performed using the GKS approach, no jumps are observed, as expected. Moreover, we demonstrate that for high-spin systems, a full three-dimensional treatment is crucial; the spherical approximation commonly used in atoms causes a qualitative deviation. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.},

The porphyrins contain central elements from three distinct groups in the Periodic Table with different oxidation states, types, and numbers of axial ligands, as well as different peripheral substituents on the porphyrin ring. Shortly after photoexcitation, in all cases, the primary multiplet polarization of the porphyrin triplet state evolves into long-lived net polarization whose lifetime is determined by the lifetime of the triplet state. The zero-field splitting parameters and sign of the multiplet polarization vary significantly among the porphyrins, but the transient EPR spectra taken at later times are remarkably similar. The development of long-lived net polarization is proposed to involve the dynamic Jahn–Teller effect, in which hopping between the two lowest triplet states occurs.},

Recently, the pursuit of this goal has been aided by machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which provide energies and forces at quantum mechanical accuracy but at a fraction of the cost of the reference quantum mechanical calculations. Assembling the training set of relevant configurations is key to building the MLIP. Here, we demonstrate two approaches to training reactive MLIPs based on reaction pathway information. One approach exploits reaction datasets containing reactant, product, and transition state structures. Using an S N 2 reaction dataset, we accurately locate reaction pathways and transition state geometries of up to 170 unseen reactions. In another approach, which does not depend on data availability, we present an efficient active learning procedure that yields an accurate MLIP and converged minimum energy path given only the reaction end point structures, avoiding quantum mechanics driven reaction pathway search at any stage of training set construction. We demonstrate this procedure on an S N 2 reaction in the gas phase and with a small number of solvating water molecules, predicting reaction barriers within 20 meV of the reference quantum chemistry method. We then apply the active learning procedure on a more complex reaction involving a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and proton transfer, comparing the results against the reactive ReaxFF force field. Our active learning procedure, in addition to rapidly finding reaction paths for individual reactions, provides an approach to building large reaction path databases for training transferable reactive machine learning potentials.},

In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: neural spline flows, conditional flow matching, and denoising diffusion probabilistic models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) neural spline flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) conditional flow matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) denoising diffusion probabilistic models appear the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib 9 peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation.

Modern machine-learning (ML) potentials provide the most precise representation compared to electronic structure calculations, while traditional potentials provide a less precise but computationally much faster representation and, thus, allow simulations of larger systems. We present a method to combine a traditional and a ML potential into a multi-resolution description, leading to an adaptive-precision potential with an optimum of performance and precision in large, complex atomistic systems. The required precision is determined per atom by a local structure analysis and updated automatically during simulation. We use copper as demonstrator material with an embedded atom model as classical force field and an atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as ML potential, but, in principle, a broader class of potential combinations can be coupled by this method. The approach is developed for the molecular-dynamics simulator LAMMPS and includes a load-balancer to prevent problems due to the atom dependent force-calculation times, which makes it suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. The developed adaptive-precision copper potential represents the ACE-forces with a precision of 10 me V/Å and the ACE-energy exactly for the precisely calculated atoms in a nanoindentation of 4 × 10 6 atoms calculated for 100 ps and shows a speedup of 11.3 compared with a full ACE simulation.},

While significant effort has been made in this field over the last decade, data-driven approaches generally rely on the paradigm of imposing a fixed base of library functions. In order to promote sparsity, finding the optimal set of basis functions is a necessary condition but a challenging task to guess in advance. Here, we propose an alternative approach that consists of optimizing the very library of functions while imposing sparsity. The robustness of our results is not only evaluated by the quality of the fit of the discovered model but also by the statistical distribution of the residuals with respect to the original noise in the data. In order to avoid choosing one metric over the other, we would rather rely on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for systematically generating a subset of optimal models sorted in a Pareto front. We illustrate how this method can be used as a tool to derive microkinetic equations from experimental data.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is finding increasingly more applications in quantum chemistry, particularly to simulate electronic structure and molecular properties of simple systems. The transformation of a molecular Hamiltonian from the fermionic space to the qubit space results in a series of Pauli strings. Calculating the energy then involves evaluating the expectation values of each of these strings, which presents a significant bottleneck for applying variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) in quantum chemistry. Unlike fermionic Hamiltonians, the terms in a qubit Hamiltonian are additive. This work leverages this property to introduce a novel method for extracting information from the partial qubit Hamiltonian, thereby enhancing the efficiency of VQEs. This work introduces the SHARC-VQE (Simplified Hamiltonian Approximation, Refinement, and Correction-VQE) method, where the full molecular Hamiltonian is partitioned into two parts based on the ease of quantum execution. The easy-to-execute part constitutes the partial Hamiltonian, and the remaining part, while more complex to execute, is generally less significant. The latter is approximated by a refined operator and added up as a correction into the partial Hamiltonian. SHARC-VQE significantly reduces computational costs for molecular simulations. The cost of a single energy measurement can be reduced from O ( N 4 ϵ 2 ) to O ( 1 ϵ 2 ) for a system of N qubits and accuracy ϵ , while the overall cost of VQE can be reduced from O ( N 7 ϵ 2 ) to O ( N 3 ϵ 2 ) ⁠ . Furthermore, measurement outcomes using SHARC-VQE are less prone to errors induced by noise from quantum circuits, reducing the errors from 20%–40% to 5%–10% without any additional error correction or mitigation technique. In addition, the SHARC-VQE is demonstrated as an initialization technique, where the simplified partial Hamiltonian is used to identify an optimal starting point for a complex problem. Overall, this method improves the efficiency of VQEs and enhances the accuracy and reliability of quantum simulations by mitigating noise and overcoming computational challenges.},

  abstract = {High-resolution techniques capable of manipulating from single molecules to millions of cells are combined with three-dimensional modeling followed by simulation to comprehend the specific aspects of chromosomes. From the theoretical perspective, the energy landscape theory from protein folding inspired the development of the minimal chromatin model (MiChroM). In this work, two biologically relevant MiChroM energy terms were minimized under different conditions, revealing a competition between loci compartmentalization and motor-driven activity mechanisms in chromatin folding. Enhancing the motor activity energy baseline increased the lengthwise compaction and reduced the polymer entanglement. Concomitantly, decreasing compartmentalization-related interactions reduced the overall polymer collapse, although compartmentalization given by the microphase separation remained almost intact. For multiple chromosome simulations, increased motorization intensified the territory formation of the different chains and reduced compartmentalization strength lowered the probability of contact formation of different loci between multiple chains, approximating to the experimental inter-contacts of the human chromosomes. These findings have direct implications for experimental data-driven chromosome modeling, specially those involving multiple chromosomes. The interplay between phase-separation and territory formation mechanisms should be properly implemented in order to recover the genome architecture and dynamics, features that might play critical roles in regulating nuclear functions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamic behavior of complex biomolecules requires simplified models that not only make computations feasible but also reveal fundamental mechanisms. Coarse-graining (CG) achieves this by grouping atoms into beads, whose stochastic dynamics can be derived using the Mori–Zwanzig formalism, capturing both reversible and irreversible interactions. In liquid, the dissipative bead–bead interactions have so far been restricted to hydrodynamic couplings. However, friction does not only arise from the solvent but, notably, from the internal degrees of freedom missing in the CG beads. This leads to an additional “internal friction” whose relevance is studied in this contribution. By comparing with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD), we neatly show that in order to accurately reproduce the dynamics of a globular protein in water using a CG model, not only a precise determination of elastic couplings and the Stokesian self-friction of each bead is required. Critically, the inclusion of internal friction between beads is also necessary for a faithful representation of protein dynamics. We propose to optimize the parameters of the CG model through a self-averaging method that integrates the CG dynamics with an evolution equation for the CG parameters. This approach ensures that selected quantities, such as the radial distribution function and the time correlation of bead velocities, match the corresponding MD values.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional optical spectroscopy experiments have examined photoprotective mechanisms in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) photosynthetic complex, showing that exciton transfer pathways change significantly depending on the environmental redox conditions. Higgins et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 118 (11), e2018240118 (2021)] have theoretically linked these observations to changes in a quantum vibronic coupling, whereby onsite energies are altered under oxidizing conditions such that exciton energy gaps are detuned from a specific vibrational motion of the bacteriochlorophyll a . These arguments rely on an analysis of exciton transfer rates within Redfield theory, which is known to provide an inaccurate description of the influence of the vibrational environment on the exciton dynamics in the FMO complex. Here, we use a memory kernel formulation of the hierarchical equations of motion to obtain non-perturbative estimations of exciton transfer rates, which yield a modified physical picture. Our findings indicate that onsite energy shifts alone do not reproduce the reported rate changes in the oxidative environment. We systematically examine a model that includes combined changes in both site energies and the frequency of a local vibration in the oxidized complex while maintaining consistency with absorption spectra and achieving qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with the measured changes in transfer rates. Our analysis points to potential limitations of the FMO electronic Hamiltonian, which was originally derived by fitting spectra to perturbative theories. Overall, our work suggests that further experimental and theoretical analyses may be needed to understand the variations of exciton dynamics under different redox conditions.},

  abstract = {In light of the recent discrepancies reported between fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo and local natural orbital coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large molecular systems [Al-Hamdani et al. , Nat. Commun. 12 , 3927 (2021)], the applicability of CCSD(T) is assessed using a model framework. The use of the semi-empirical π -space only Pariser–Parr–Pople (PPP) model for studying large molecules is critically examined and is shown to recover both bandgap closure as system size increases and long range dispersive behavior of r −6 with increasing separation between monomers. Since bandgap closure in systems with long-range Coulomb interactions is problematic for perturbative methods, such as CCSD(T), this model, therefore, serves as a testing ground for such methods, enabling them to be benchmarked with high-order CC methods, which are not possible with ab initio Hamiltonians. Using the PPP model, coupled cluster methodologies, CCSDTQ and CCSDT(Q), are then used to benchmark CCSDT and CCSD(T) methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large one- and two-dimensional molecular systems up to the dibenzocoronene dimer. We show that CCSD(T) demonstrates no signs of overestimating the interaction energy for these systems. Furthermore, by examining the Hartree–Fock HOMO–LUMO gap of these large molecules, the perturbative treatment of the triples contribution in CCSD(T) is not expected to cause problems for accurately capturing the interaction energy for system sizes up to at least circumcoronene.},

Usually, even for the simplest systems, such calculations are either performed for low-intensity excitations where perturbative methods are valid and/or by assuming a simplified pulse envelope, such as a δ -function in time. Here, we use the phase-cycling method for the exact calculation of the nonlinear response without making the aforementioned approximations even for high-intensity excitation. We compare the simulation results to several experimental observations to prove the validity of these calculations. The saturation of the photon-echo signal from excitons in a semiconductor quantum well sample is measured. The excitation-intensity dependent measurement shows nonlinear contributions up to twelfth order. Intensity-dependent simulations reproduce this effect without explicitly considering higher-order interactions. In addition, we present simulation results that replicate previously reported experiments with high-intensity excitation of semiconductor quantum dots. By accurately reproducing a variety of phenomena such as higher-order contributions, switching of coherent signals, and changes in photon-echo transients, we prove the efficacy of the phase-cycling method to calculate the coherent nonlinear signal for high-intensity excitation. This method would be particularly useful for systems with multiple, well-separated peaks and/or large inhomogeneities.},

Using the inherent color-gradient magnitude and a single adjustable parameter, evaporation sites are chosen in a computationally efficient way with seamless mass exchange between the components, with no change to the core algorithm. Extensive validation across diverse interface geometries and evaporation flux magnitudes demonstrates high accuracy, with errors below 5% for unit density ratios. For density contrasts, the method remains robust in the limit of smaller evaporation flux magnitudes and density ratios. Our approach extends the applicability of the color-gradient LB model to scenarios involving reaction-limited evaporation, such as droplet evaporation on heated substrates, vacuum evaporation of molten metals, and drying processes in porous media.},

The structure of the state space could be quite complicated for quantum many-body systems, and the systematic decomposition of the state space is normally involved. Recently, a modular tensor diagram approach was proposed to reorganize the state space hierarchically based on a modular basis. Here, we review the construction of spin eigenfunctions for multiple exciton systems and further develop modular tensor diagrams to exemplify the hierarchical symmetry of the state space. The newly constructed spin eigenfunctions for quadruple excitons, along with the results for triple excitons, are used to demonstrate the effective decomposition of the state space into hierarchical tensorial structures. A universal recursive relation is derived to determine the coefficients of spin eigenfunctions exhibiting transformation symmetry between different classes of elementary modules for an arbitrary number of exciton units. Interestingly, different coupling schemes mapped to quantum many-body interactions lead to different spin adapted basis states, which may correspond to different realistic systems upon the breakdown of spin degeneracy. This work highlights the hierarchical symmetry of the tensorial structure of quantum many-body systems, which may facilitate a better understanding of the structure property relationship toward the object-oriented materials design.},

A distinct evolution of the partial rotational modes of N 2 and O 2 outside the selective excitation region was observed, which is related to energy transfer collisions between N 2 and O 2 molecules during the rotational energy relaxation process in air. The SLT results accord well with the S-branch rotational spectra of N 2 and O 2 obtained from theoretical calculations, confirming the validity of SLT analysis.

  abstract = {Recent method developments involving path integral simulations have come a long way in making these techniques practical for studying condensed phase non-equilibrium phenomena. One of the main difficulties that still needs to be surmounted is the scaling of the algorithms with the system dimensionality. The majority of recent techniques have only changed the order of this scaling (going from exponential to possibly a very high-ordered polynomial) and not eased the dependence on the system size. In this current work, we introduce an adaptive kink filtration technique for the path generation approach that leverages the locality of the interactions present in the system and the consequent sparsity of the propagator matrix to remove the asymptotic size dependence of the simulations for the propagation of reduced density matrices. This enables the simulation of larger systems at a significantly reduced cost. This technique can be used for simulation of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium correlation functions and is demonstrated here using examples from both. We show that the cost becomes constant with the dimensionality of the system. The only place where a system size-dependence still remains is the calculation of the dynamical maps or propagators, which are important for the transfer tensor method. The cost of calculating this solvent-renormalized propagator is the same as the cost of propagating all the elements of the reduced density matrix, which scales as the square of the size. This adaptive kink-filtration technique promises to be instrumental in extending the affordability of path integral simulations for very large systems.},

  abstract = {Solvation free energy is a driving force that plays an important role in the stability of biomolecular conformations. Currently, the implicit solvent model is widely used to calculate solvation energies of biomolecules such as proteins. However, for proteins, the implicit solvent calculation does not provide much detailed information since a protein is highly inhomogeneous on its surface. In this study, we develop an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which allows us to investigate detailed site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, including the role of counter ions and intra-protein interactions. This approach facilitates the analysis of specific residue interactions with solvent molecules, extending the understanding of protein solubility to the energetic impacts of site-specific residue–solvent interactions. Our study showed that specific residue–solvent interactions are strongly influenced by the electrostatic environment created by its nearby residues, especially charged residues. In particular, charged residues on the protein surface are mainly responsible for the heterogeneity of the electrostatic environment of the protein surface, and they significantly affect the local distribution of water. In addition, counter ions change the local electrostatic environment and alter specific residue–water interactions. Neutral residues also interact with water, with polar residues being more prominent than nonpolar ones but contributing less to solvation energy than charged residues. This study illustrates an explicit solvent approach to protein solvation, which gives residue-specific contributions to protein solvation and provides detailed information on site-specific hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity.},

  abstract = {A multidimensional version of the modification to vibrational perturbation theory is developed in this article. The modifications to the action are of two types: one is by shifting the energy scale with the VPT2 zero point energy E 0 (mVPT2) and the other is by shifting the action by a constant VPT2-based action Δ S and is denoted mYF. These modifications give a continuous “modified” action over the whole energy range. The multidimensional versions of the mVPT2 and mYF theories have been applied to the collinear H + H 2 and D + H 2 reactions to calculate thermal reaction rates. The results show that the rates computed using the mVPT2 theory are marginally better than those computed by the mYF theory. The corresponding kinetic isotopic effects have also been computed. Both the theories account for the correct ℏ 2 limit at high temperature and not the parabolic barrier limit as in various other theories. The mVPT2 and mYF theories also improve upon the thermal rates in the low temperature limit due to the shifting of the action by the zero point energy shift E 0 . The resulting theory is more accurate than the ring polymer molecular dynamics based approximation over the whole temperature range probed. The results presented here indicate that the multidimensional version of the modified VPT2 theory may be the recommended method for computing thermal tunneling rates in multidimensional systems.},

  abstract = {Mixed halide inorganic perovskites exhibit exceptional stability and photovoltaic performance and are considered to be promising photovoltaic materials. However, the chemical diversity of these materials presents a vast screening space, making it challenging to efficiently identify high-performance materials solely through theoretical calculations or experiments. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a multidimensional high-throughput screening strategy that combines machine learning with first-principles calculations, specifically designed to identify MHIPs with optimal bandgap and light absorption properties. The bandgap and light absorption models have achieved determination coefficients (r 2 ) of 0.9896 and 0.9833, with root mean square errors of 0.1890 eV and 0.2190 10 5 eV · cm −1 , respectively, demonstrating the high precision and reliability of the models. In the present work, the generation of 306 521 candidate materials through mixed B-site elements is reported, leading to the successful identification of 295 materials with ideal characteristics for MHIPs via screening. Subsequently, an in-depth density functional theory validation is conducted on 20 of these materials. The research results demonstrate that Cs 2 AgBi 0.5 Sb 0.25 Ir 0.25 I 6 and CsSn 0.75 Ge 0.25 I 3 exhibit outstanding performance, making them the most promising candidate materials for practical applications. These results fully confirm the scientific validity and effectiveness of our screening strategy, laying a solid foundation for the exploration and optimization of high-performance perovskite solar cell materials.},

  abstract = {Hydrated electrons are anionic species that are formed when an excess electron is introduced into liquid water. Building an understanding of how hydrated electrons behave in solution has been a long-standing effort of simulation methods, of which density functional theory (DFT) has come to the fore in recent years. The ability of DFT to model the reactive chemistry of hydrated electrons is an attractive advantage over semi-classical methodologies; however, relatively few density functional approximations (DFAs) have been used for the hydrated electron simulations presented in the literature. Here, we simulate hydrated electron systems using a series of exchange–correlation (XC) functionals spanning Jacob’s ladder. We calculate a variety of experimental and other observables of the hydrated electron and compare the XC functional dependence for each quantity. We find that the formation of a stable localized hydrated electron is not necessarily limited to hybrid XC functionals and that some hybrid functionals produce delocalized hydrated electrons or electrons that react with the surrounding water at an unphysically fast rate. We further characterize how different DFAs impact the solvent structure and predicted spectroscopy of the hydrated electron, considering several methods for calculating the hydrated electron’s absorption spectrum for the best comparison between structures generated using different density functionals. None of the dozen or so DFAs that we investigated are able to correctly predict the hydrated electron’s spectroscopy, vertical detachment energy, or molar solvation volume.},

The number n x of particles interacting with a particle in position x is finite but unbounded in x . The growth of n x as | x | → ∞ creates a major technical problem for solving our SDE system.

Action-angle variables, expressed through the scattering data, are constructed based on these Poisson brackets. It is noteworthy that the analyticity of scattering data differs from that of the AKNS-type spectral problem, necessitating adjustments to the integral paths when deriving the completeness relations. Interestingly, the conservation laws for the equation can be expressed in terms of either the spectral parameter or the potential functions, revealing the connection between the potential functions and the scattering data.},

After introducing the mathematical framework, we apply the framework to a couple of applications. The first application is related to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing gain and loss phenomena, widely considered in the context of PT -quantum mechanics. The second application is related to a finite-dimensional version of the Swanson Hamiltonian, never considered before, and addresses the problem of deriving a milder version of the RDM when exceptional points form in the system.},

This method does not target dimensionality reduction: rather, this method helps shed light on the memory-dependence of 1-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the 1-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems (H 2 and HeH + ), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the 4-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function.},

In uniform internally heated convection, the supply of heat equally leaves the domain entirely by conduction in the absence of a flow. When the heating, quantified by the Rayleigh number, R , becomes sufficiently large, turbulent convection ensues, reducing the heat leaving the domain through the bottom boundary. In the case of no-slip boundary conditions, with the background field method, we prove that F B ≳ R − 2 / 3 − R − 1 / 2 ⁡ log ( 1 − R − 2 / 3 ) ⁠ , up to a positive constant independent of the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers.

  abstract     = {There have been several attempts in recent years to extend the notions of symplectic and Poisson structures in order to create a suitable geometrical framework for classical field theories, trying to achieve a success similar to the use of these concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics. These notions always have a graded character, since the multisymplectic forms are of a higher degree than two. Another line of work has been to extend the concept of Dirac structures to these new scenarios. In the present paper we review all these notions, relate them and propose and study a generalization that (under some mild regularity conditions) includes them and is of graded nature. We expect this generalization to allow us to advance in the study of classical field theories, their integrability, reduction, numerical approximations and even their quantization.},

The radial equation is simply related to the famous hypergeometric equation, and our work is carried out in this general setting. We find several families of infinite sets of special parameter values for which Liouvillian solutions exist, and we demonstrate how to generate these solutions recursively. The solutions are related to hypergeometric polynomials and in some cases can be constructed explicitly. For some of the families, the Liouvillian solutions exactly satisfy the boundary conditions for quasinormal modes, a fundamental set of damped, outgoing wave-functions that depend only on the background spacetime and scalar field parameters. In these families we obtain agreement with published results on the scalar quasinormal modes of the pure de Sitter spacetime. For other families, we establish conjectures regarding the factorization of the parameter constraints required for existence of Liouvillian solutions. Our results are consistent with published results on the hypergeometric equation and the well known Pöschl–Teller equation. Our new contributions are to demonstrate how to generate the hypergeometric Liouvillian solutions recursively, to completely solve the quasinormal mode problem with Liouvillian solutions, and to analyze the Liouvillian parameter constraints for the hypergeometric equation, including the case of the physical de Sitter parameters. This work contributes new knowledge to the fields of special functions and general relativity.},

The quantum and classical systems share the entire eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are related one to one. When the birth rate B ( x ) and the death rate D ( x ) are chosen to be the coefficients of the difference equation governing the orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, the quantum system is exactly solvable. The eigenvectors are the orthogonal polynomials themselves and the eigenvalues are given analytically. Many examples are periodic since their eigenvalues are all integers, or all integers for integer parameters. The situation is very similar to the exactly solvable one dimensional quantum mechanical systems. These exactly solvable BD processes contain many adjustable free parameters which could be helpful for various simulation purposes.},

To shed light on this phenomenon, we focus on a special two-dimensional anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic equation near a background magnetic field with mixed dissipation. We study the stability problem and large time behavior of solutions. Precisely, we obtain the global stability of smooth solution for the two-dimensional nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic system in the sense of H 2 . In addition, we also establish the large time behavior with explicit decay rates to the linearized system.},
