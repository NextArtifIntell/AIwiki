  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of GPS modules, there are various urban applications such as car navigation relying on trajectory data modeling. In this work, we study the problem of modeling on-road trajectories, which is to predict the next road segment given a partial GPS trajectory. Existing methods that model trajectories with Markov chain or recurrent neural network suffer from various issues, including limited capability of sequential modeling, insufficiency of incorporating the road network context, and lack of capturing the underlying semantics of trajectories. In this article, we propose a new trajectory modeling framework called Multi-task Modeling for Trajectories (MMTraj+), which avoids these issues. Specifically, MMTraj+ uses multi-head self-attention networks for sequential modeling, captures the overall road network as the context information for road segment embedding, and performs an auxiliary task of predicting the trajectory destination information (namely the ID and bearing angle) to better guide the main trajectory modeling task (controlled by a carefully designed gating mechanism). In addition, we tailor MMTraj+ for the cases where the destination information is known by dropping its auxiliary task of predicting the trajectory destination information. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Much of the complexity of social, biological, and engineering systems arises from the complicated interactions among the entities in the corresponding networks. A number of network analysis tools have been successfully used to discover latent structures termed communities in such networks. However, some communities with relatively weak structures can be difficult to uncover because they are obscured by other stronger connections. To cope with this situation, our previous work proposes an algorithm called HICODE to detect and amplify the dominant and hidden community structures. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic theoretical analysis on the impact of hidden community structure and the efficacy of the HICODE algorithm, as well as provide illustrations of the detection process and results. Specifically, we define a multi-layer stochastic block model and use this model to explain why the existence of hidden structure makes the detection of dominant structure harder than equivalent random noises, which can also explain why many community detection algorithms only focusing on the dominant structure do not work well as expected. We then provide theoretical analysis that the iterative reducing methods could help to enhance the discovery of hidden structure as well as the dominant structure in the multi-layer stochastic block model for the two cases of accurate and inaccurate detection. Finally, visual simulations and experimental results are presented to show the process of HICODE algorithm and the impact of different number of layers on the detection quality.},

  abstract     = {Federated recommender systems (FedRSs) effectively tackle the tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and privacy preservation. However, recent studies have revealed severe vulnerabilities in FedRSs, particularly against untargeted attacks seeking to undermine their overall performance. Defense methods employed in traditional recommender systems are not applicable to FedRSs, and existing robust aggregation schemes for other federated learning-based applications have proven ineffective in FedRSs. Building on the observation that malicious clients contribute negatively to the training process, we design a novel contribution-aware robust aggregation scheme to defend FedRSs against untargeted attacks, named contribution-aware Bayesian knowledge distillation aggregation (ConDA), comprising two key components for the defense. In the first contribution estimation component, we decentralize the estimation from the server side to the client side and propose an ensemble-based Shapley value to enable the efficient calculation of contributions, addressing the limitations of lacking auxiliary validation data and high computational complexity. In the second contribution-aware aggregation component, we merge the decentralized contributions via a majority voting mechanism and integrate the merged contributions into a Bayesian knowledge distillation aggregation scheme for robust aggregation, mitigating the impact of unreliable contributions induced by attacks. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of ConDA on two real-world datasets from movie and music service providers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of ConDA over the baseline robust aggregation schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study a challenging problem in contrastive learning when just a portion of data is aligned in multi-view dataset due to temporal, spatial, or spatio-temporal asynchronism across views. It is important to study partially view-aligned data since this type of data is common in real-world application and easily leads to data inconsistency among different views. Such a Partially View-aligned Problem (PVP) in contrastive learning has been relatively less touched so far, especially in downstream tasks, i.e., classification and clustering. In order to solve this problem, we introduce a flexible margin and propose margin-aware noise-robust contrastive learning to simultaneously identify the within-category counterparts from the other view of one data point based on the established cross-view correspondence and learn a shared representation. To be specific, the proposed learning framework is built on a novel margin-aware noise-robust contrastive loss. Since data pairs are used as input for the proposed margin-aware noise-robust contrastive learning, we build positive pairs according to the known correspondences and negative pairs in the manner of random sampling. Our margin-aware noise-robust contrastive learning framework is able to effectively reduce or remove the impacts caused by the possible existing noise for the constructed pairs in a margin-aware manner, i.e., false negative pairs led by random sampling in PVP. We relax the proposed margin-aware noise-robust contrastive loss and then give a detailed mathematical analysis for the effectiveness of our loss. As an instantiation, we construct an example under the proposed margin-aware noise-robust contrastive learning framework for validation in this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of extending contrastive learning to a margin-aware noise-robust version for dealing with PVP. We also enrich the learning paradigm when there is noise in the data. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method in the classification and clustering tasks.},
