  abstract     = {With the rapid development of science and technology, exploring the image logic semantics of users’ Chinese language using deep learning is crucial for understanding users’ interactions in virtual space. To address the challenges of recognizing existential sentences in Chinese language images, this research introduces a Tree-LSTM encoder, combined with an improved Transformer attention mechanism, to construct a logical semantic recognition model. The model was validated using a dataset from the Modern Dictionary database. Results showed that the proposed model achieved a recognition accuracy of 90.01%, surpassing other models by at least 2.99%. After incorporating Wikipedia data, the model’s performance in handling complex sentence structures and technical terminology was particularly outstanding. When all the extended data sources were integrated, the model’s accuracy reached 92.31%, representing a 2.3% improvement over the original dataset. This success is due to the Tree-LSTM’s ability to capture hierarchical and logical relationships within sentences. The model also effectively learns and recognizes low-frequency new words, enhancing overall performance.},

Two interdependent models are trained within a framework, allowing us to forecast interactions and identify influential features. Saliency maps were utilized to visualize the factors affecting these interactions over time. The technique helps reveal how specific viral properties shift in response to human factors.

  abstract     = {Bike-sharing systems (BSSs) have recently become important in urban transportation due to several factors, such as their cost-effectiveness and environmental considerations. The BSS provides an enormous amount of data that is recorded regarding trips. This huge volume of bike sharing data raises various challenges and opportunities. Many research studies have used bike sharing datasets to understand the geographical, social, financial, and behavioral aspects of bike user behaviors. While existing literature primarily focuses on predicting the number of rentals and returns per station, this study addresses the complementary aspect of predicting the trip duration and distance of the trip. Accurate prediction of ride duration allows a better estimate of bike availability at stations, while distance predictions assist in maintenance planning based on bike usage patterns. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, the proposed work clusters the BSS dataset into k sub-datasets based on similarity of dataset instances. Then, the predictive model is trained to predict the data of each sub-dataset separately. Thus, there will be k models for the k sub-dataset. Next, the performance of the proposed method, the average score of the k models, will be compared to the performance of a model trained on the complete dataset on predicting BSSs ride duration and distance of the trip. The rationale for splitting the dataset into k sub-datasets is to separate similar patterns in one sub-dataset. Second, the utilization of the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on the BSSs data was proposed for the clustering purpose, as the DTW usage is very limited in the current literature of BSSs. The dataset clustering is based on the similarity of the curves representing the number of trips between each pair of bike stations throughout the day hours. Then, the DTW algorithm is used to measure the curve similarity between these bike station pairs’ curves. These two contributions of the proposed approach complement existing prediction models for rentals and returns, providing a comprehensive solution for BSS optimization. The proposed method was thoroughly evaluated on two real datasets of different sizes. For the two datasets, the obtained results show that the best improvements of the predictive model’s accuracy are 30% and 42% on average for predicting trip duration and distance of the trip, respectively.},

The prediction is challenging as EV energy consumption is highly variable and dependent on context . First, this paper proposes an integrated framework for the collection of online telematic data, processing of this data, online maintenance of statistics, and machine-learning-based prediction of travel time and energy consumption. A key feature of the proposed framework is the preprocessing of the trajectory data into triplets , a convenient data unit that captures the relevant context necessary for effective energ y prediction. The second contribution of the paper addresses the effective management of drastic change in context through robust energy prediction models. In particular, using few-shot learning techniques, we tackle the problem of the need to create different energy prediction models for different EV types, from small EVs to electric buses. Experimental results on three different data sets demonstrate how energy prediction models adapt to different EV types.},

  abstract     = {Downstream applications for point cloud registration, like LiDAR Odometry, often conduct Iterative Closest Points (ICP) in the initial frame-to-frame matching and/or subsequent map refinement. However, due to its distance-based processing nature, ICP relies on an accurate pose initialization while implicating increased computational complexity with a growing number of points. To meet specific runtime requirements, methods often apply the extensive mapping step at low frequencies, e.g. every 10 frames, which in turn leads to increased noise on the calculated trajectory. To tackle the discrepancy between runtime and accuracy, we present MagneticPillars++, an extension of our previous point cloud registration approach optimized for LiDAR Odometry, introducing novel intermediate cell correspondence filtering and accelerated match normalization. Furthermore, we propose a frame-to-keyframe matching technique replacing the simple frame-to-frame matching within a LiDAR Odometry pipeline. This can tremendously reduce noise without the need for expensive ICP corrections. We conduct extensive experiments for various tasks like point cloud registration, LiDAR Odometry, and loop closure estimation, demonstrating the versatility of our approach, where we are able to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and runtime, resulting in residual translation and rotation errors of up to 4.7 cm and 0.231 with an average runtime of.},

  abstract     = {Machine vision application in agriculture has spurred significant interest in crop-missing detection. This study targets critical challenges, such as comprehensive aerial imagery coverage, tiny seedlings easily mistaken for weeds, and the absence of adaptive learning in traditional row classification. We propose a novel methodology for missing seedling detection, which comprises three essential stages: seedling localization, row classification, and missing region prediction. We present SeedNet, a detector that leverages row direction information to enhance small seedling detection performance. By incorporating this information, SeedNet improves recall by 25.3 % and AP by 15.4 % compared to the baseline. Additionally, we introduce PeakNet, a deep learning-based classifier for row segmentation that efficiently adapts to row spacing without any prior assumptions, achieving an accuracy of 99.69 % . Finally, missing areas are predicted by analyzing the relative distances between adjacent seedlings within the same row. Under challenging outdoor conditions, this method achieves a missing detection accuracy of 98 % , meeting practical requirements for field testing. SeedNet and PeakNet demonstrate exceptional performance in real-time processing, achieving inference speeds of 105 FPS and 2295 FPS, respectively. These results indicate strong potential for practical applications in real-time agricultural systems. The proposed approach provides a high-performance, low-cost solution for crop missing detection.},

  abstract     = {The rise of social media has amplified online sharing, necessitating businesses to comprehend public sentiment. Traditional sentiment analysis struggles with sarcasm detection and class imbalance. To address this, we introduce Synthetic Ensemble Oversampling methods (SEO) that effectively leverage the strengths of various oversampling algorithms. By incorporating ensemble learning principles into oversampling techniques, our proposed methods offer distinct strategies for selecting newly generated sarcastic data. In this study, we employ five oversampling algorithms: Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN), polynom-fit-SMOTE, Proximity Weighted Synthetic Sampling (ProWSyn), and SMOTE with Instance Prioritization and Filtering (SMOTE_IPF). We work with two imbalanced sarcasm detection datasets, iSarcasmEval and SARC-reduced, collected from Twitter and Reddit. After extracting features from using Word2Vec, Global Vectors (GloVe), and FastText, we apply oversampling and ensemble techniques. Evaluated across six classifiers – Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and BERT – the results demonstrate that the SEO2 framework consistently enhances classifier performance compared to single oversampling techniques. Notably, the Cluster Uncentered method frequently provides the best improvements across datasets, achieving significant gains in both AUC and F1 scores. These findings highlight the potential of ensemble-based oversampling in addressing class imbalance for sarcasm detection.},

Contrastive learning typically employs a single contrastive relationship based on individual instances. However, depending on the task-related characteristics, such as facial skin images, this approach may be unsuitable for learning useful representations. In this work, we propose an advanced contrastive learning method to learn high-quality facial skin representations that are useful for various downstream applications related to skin disorders, such as wrinkles and pigmentation. Our method leverages metadata to establish effective multi-instance contrastive relationships specifically for facial skin images. To this end, we employ mini-batches, constructed through the integration of multiple contrastive relationships, to enable a model to learn the multifaceted features of facial skin. Using a facial skin image dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in classifying facial wrinkles and pigmentation severity compared to conventional contrastive learning. The features learned by the proposed method adapt well to other skin lesion datasets from different sources, demonstrating the transferability of the learned skin representations.

Also, the proposed synchronized parallel processing ranking based hash map framed using the merge sorting technique for categorizing the excitement scores is applied in video summarization. The framework is tested on U.S. Open and Wimbledon match videos and the results show superior results against state-of-art techniques with normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) score improved by 2%, positive matching highlight segment identification increased by 20% on YouTube Videos.},

  abstract     = {Enhancing the accuracy of industrial building energy consumption forecasts is beneficial for improving energy management and addressing the imbalance between supply and demand in building electricity use. To overcome the limitations of existing energy consumption forecasting methods, which inadequately consider the specific energy usage characteristics and user behaviors in parks and often perform poorly at predicting extreme values, this study proposes a hybrid energy consumption forecasting model combines Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Initially, SSA is used to extract the autocorrelation of the electricity consumption series and eliminate the mutual interference caused by component mixing. Then, fuzzy entropy values are utilized to differentiate the complexity of various components, reconstructing them into high-frequency and low-frequency components. These components are then predicted using a multi-factor LSTM model optimized by improved particle swarm optimization, with the results aggregated for the final forecast. The results indicate that the model’s root mean square error is only 12.116 kWh, which is lower compared to the LSTM multi-factor model, the EMD-LSTM model, and the SSA-LSTM model. The model shows a closer fit to the original series trend and more accurate predictions at extreme points, aligning more closely with actual values.},

  abstract     = {The use of regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs), which reduce hazardous air pollution and save energy, has increased with the rapid growth of industrial technology. Therefore, detecting and explaining anomalies in RTOs have become important. To accurately detect anomalies in RTOs, it is required to apply reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) models, which is currently proposed as a main AD research area. However, traditional explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) cannot explain reconstruction-based AD models to identify main facilities in RTOs. To address this problem, we developed a method to improve the accuracy of XAI in explaining reconstruction-based AD models. Specifically, we first grouped the variables based on correlation and the clustering analysis. We then calculated the impact of each group on normal/abnormal events in terms of the maximum mean discrepancy and cosine similarity. Using the most influencing variables based on our method, XAI correctly identified the main variables without considering unnecessary variables. Experimental results on a real-world RTO dataset showed that our method improve the accuracy of XAI that determine the main variables compared to the traditional XAI.},

  abstract     = {To address the problem of single-mode vulnerability to complex environments, a multimode fusion network with mutual attention is proposed. This network combines the use of laser, infrared and millimeter wave modalities to leverage the advantages of each mode in different environments, increasing the network’s resilience to interference. The study begins with the construction of pixel-level fusion networks, feature-weighted fusion networks and the multimode mutual attention fusion network. A comprehensive introduction to the multimode mutual attention fusion network is given, as well as a comparison with the other two networks. The model is then trained and evaluated using data from glide rocket and drone experiments. Finally, an analysis of the anti-outlier interference capability of the multimode fusion network with mutual attention is carried out. The test results show that the multimode mutual attention fusion network containing a feature fusion attention mechanism has the highest detection performance and anti-interference ability. Without interference, the network achieves a remarkable accuracy of 0.98 for multi-target recognition. In addition, with an accuracy of 0.96, it ensures a high level of stability in various interference environments. In addition, the introduction of multi-scale fusion has improved the rocket’s speed adaptability by about 75%.},

These reviews not only reflect customer sentiments but also crucially influence other users’ purchasing decisions due to their public accessibility. The sheer volume and complexity of product reviews make manual sorting challenging, necessitating businesses to autonomously process and discern customer sentiments. Chinese, a predominant language on e-commerce platforms, presents unique challenges in sentiment analysis due to its character-based nature. This paper introduces an innovative Dual-Channel BiLSTM-CNN (DC-BiLSTM-CNN) algorithm. Based on the language characteristics of Chinese product reviews, a sentiment analysis algorithm, dual channel BiLSTM-CNN (DC-BiLSTM-CNN), is proposed. The algorithm constructs two channels, transforming text into both character and word vectors and inputting them into Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The combination of these channels facilitates a more comprehensive feature extraction from reviews. Comparative analysis revealed that DC-BiLSTM-CNN significantly outperforms baseline models, substantially enhancing the classification of product reviews. We conclude that the proposed DC-BiLSTM-CNN algorithm offers an effective solution for handling Chinese product reviews, carrying positive implications for businesses seeking to enhance product and service quality, ultimately resulting in heightened user satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges when drilling small and deep holes is the difficulty of chip evacuation. As the hole depth increases, chips tend to become tightly compressed, causing chip jamming. It leads to a rapid increase in cutting forces and strong random fluctuations. The discontinuous chip evacuation process makes the cutting force signal strongly nonlinear and random, making it difficult to predict accurately. In this paper, we have developed a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) model for training using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to predict torque during deep drilling. Unlike many previous studies, this model uses hole depth as an input vector element instead of hole diameter. The model has been validated through experiments drilling AISI-304 stainless steel with hole depth-to-diameter ratios of 8 under continuous drilling conditions with ultrasonic-assisted vibration. The performance of the ANN model was compared with the exponential model and evaluated by the MAPE index. Results show that the ANN model has better predictive capability, the average MAPE value approximately four times smaller and higher reliability with a standard deviation approximately 3.5 times smaller than the exponential function model. This model can be further refined to predict torque for drilling deep holes for future studies.},

This study investigates ASI based on features derived from spectrogram images through a convolution neural network (CNN) with rectangular-shaped kernels. Traditionally, CNN employs square-shaped kernel and max-pooling operations at different layers, a design optimized to handle 2D data. Nevertheless, encoding of information differs slightly to deal with spectrograms. The frequency is displayed along the y-axis, and the x-axis presents the time of the audio. Amplitude is denoted by intensity within the spectrogram image at certain point. The main contributions of this study are 1: To analyze audio signals effectively using spectrograms, this study proposed the utilization of spectrogram features with different sizes and shapes of rectangular kernels to derive distinctive features by improving the recognition accuracy of the speaker identification system. 2. The extracted spectrogram-based features and models are evaluated on the ELSDSR, TSP, and LibriSpeech datasets and achieved the weighted accuracy of 96.0%, 99.2%, and 97.6%, respectively. 3.

The q -ROF-CRITIC assigns the priority weights of the attributes (i.e. comprehension and ergonomic principles), whereas the q -ROF-TOPSIS-Sort evaluates and classifies the compliance levels of road signs in view of a set of pre-defined categories, consequently bridging the limitations of the TOPSIS-Sort in handling imprecise evaluations. Demonstrated in an actual case study of evaluating 83 road signs in the Philippines, results show that prohibitive signs have the highest comprehension levels, while parking and stop signs, together with road obstacle signs, belong to the medium compliance level. Low-level compliance is observed for supplementary and intersection road signs due to unfamiliarity, while horizontal signs are ergonomically low on spatial and physical attributes. The proposed approach is supported by sensitivity analysis of q values and comparative assessments with other methods. The findings encourage further investigation into comprehensibility evaluations and open avenues for exploring the factors that influence road sign comprehension.},

This type of monitoring often relies on the use of navigation systems such as the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS data has been used to support the defense teams when identifying equipment defects, locating suspicious activity, ensuring ship collision avoidance, and detecting hazardous events. In this context, Ship Trajectory Prediction (STP) has been conducted using AIS data to support the estimation of vessel routes and locations, contributing to maritime safety and situational awareness. Currently, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model is considered the state-of-the-art for STP. However, this model can be time-consuming and can only represent a single vessel track. To solve these challenges, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models have been applied to STP to allow scalability for large data sets and to capture larger regions or anomalous vessels behavior. This research proposes a new RNN architecture that decreases the prediction error up to 50% for cargo vessels when compared to the OU model. Results also confirm that the proposed Decimal Preservation layer can benefit other RNN architectures developed in the literature by reducing their prediction errors for complex data sets.},

Fourth predictive systems are employed to investigate the intricate problem of predicting the severity of injuries sustained in traffic crashes using different regression algorithms, such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks. Compared to comparable systems without feature selection, feature resampling, and optimization methods, the results demonstrate that employing optimized XGBoost along with grid search in conjunction with SelectKBest and SMOTE strategy has resulted in greater performance, with an 89% R2 score. Our findings provide insight into the requirement for accurate forecasting models in optimization and balanced approaches to enhancing traffic safety. These findings offer a viable way to improve traffic safety tactics. As far as we know and as of right now, there hasn’t been much interest in supporting a fusion-based system that critically reviews machine learning techniques using grid search optimization, feature selection, and smote technique and examines how injury severity prediction is affected by road crashes.},

  abstract     = {This paper designs the MKSE and SEMSS methods. Among them, MKSE uses an improved TF-IDF weight calculation method to extract keywords and applies virtual keywords to construct inverted indexes, making it difficult for malicious attackers to infer the index content easily. SEMSS uses the Apriori algorithm to mine the co-occurrence relationship between words and find the keyword set that meets the minimum support threshold to improve the recall rate of search results. Finally, the security of the scheme is verified from the aspects of semantic security, effici this paper designsency, data integrity, etc. The results showed that the data encryption time of MKSE and TRSE methods increased gradually with the increase in document collection storage. The index build time was increased as the document set grew. The accuracy of the improved TF-IDF method was 63.8%. The running time of Apriori decreased with the increase of minimum support. When the minimum support was 12.0%, the Apriori algorithm ran for 211 seconds. The MKSE method was more efficient than the TRSE method in searching documents by query keywords. When the document set size was 3000, the SEMSS method had a full search rate of 81.09%. This research realizes the semantic security of outsourced data, which can efficiently and comprehensively carry out cryptographic retrieval based on keyword sorting.},

We evaluate our model on a super-resolution dataset and compare its performance against other networks, highlighting the importance of minimizing trainable parameters for real-time deployment on resource-constrained drone platforms. The effWicacy of our proposed network is further validated through image recognition tasks and real-world scenario testing.

This approach aims to handle the distributed trust issues of federated learning users and update data states rapidly. By modeling multi-source devices through federated learning, the model parameters and reputation values of participating devices are stored on the blockchain. This method incorporates factors such as experience, familiarity, and timeliness to more quickly gather reliable information about nodes to assess their behavior. Simulation results on the MNIST dataset show that when the proportion of selfish nodes is below 50%, the convergence time increases with the proportion of selfish nodes. Compared to advanced algorithms, the proposed model saves approximately 6% of interaction time. As the number of transactions significantly increases, the system’s TPS (Transactions Per Second) decreases, with an average TPS of only 3079.35 when the maximum number of transactions is 4000.

The dataset was collected from the farms using mobile phone cameras with the guidance of agricultural experts and was annotated to label the images. The results showed that the U-Net model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 96.45% and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 93.23%.

Large-scale industrial systems generate an immense volume of logs, which are difficult to handle with human capabilities. Therefore, an automated method is essential for filtering vast amounts of data. System log anomaly detection is crucial in the security field for identifying system failures, sophisticated internal attacks, and other deviations from the norm. This research area requires further development, as most Deep Learning solutions in the literature are semi-supervised. This poses a significant limitation since these solutions are impractical for large-scale ecosystems due to the high cost of labeling data. This paper introduces a method that replaces the supervised phase of semi-supervised methods with fully unsupervised heuristics, utilizing the elbow method, interquartile range, and Simulated Annealing. The unsupervised results are comparable to the semi-supervised State of the Art while demonstrating greater applicability in real-world applications. This work proposes a more suitable benchmark for the log anomaly outlier detection problem, where the training data include both normal and abnormal sequences and precede the test sessions in time. Additionally, it presents metrics on distinct log sequences to mitigate the impact of unbalanced anomaly types.},

Predicting potential friendships accurately from abundant information has become a pivotal research area. While graph neural network (GNN) have shown significant promise in prediction, existing approaches often fail to fully exploit the heterogeneous data characteristics in LBSN. Key challenges include inadequate modeling of the intricate relationships between users and points of interest (POI), overlooking the significance of spatial-temporal information in user trajectories, and underutilizing rich edge features. To address these challenges, we design a novel GRU-enhanced Heterogeneous Multigraph Attention Network (GEHMAN), which is a GNN model enhanced by GRU. We construct a heterogeneous multigraph to comprehensively capture user-POI relationships. We then employ a skip-gram model to embed POI nodes from user sub-trajectories and use RNN with GRU units to embed user nodes. GEHMAN utilize hierarchical attention mechanism to consolidate node information by aggregating diverse types of neighboring nodes and connecting edges. Experiments on six real city datasets show that compared with the best performance of six benchmark methods including LBSN2vec++, Metapath2vec and HAN, the average improvement percentages of GEHMAN in AUC, AP, and Top@K are 2.225%, 1.948%, and 6.353%, respectively.},

While earlier methods focused on spatial-domain information, recent models have explored frequency-domain data to improve performance. However, explicit frequency-domain processing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose the Implicit Frequency Selective Image Restoration Network (IFSR-Net), which implicitly captures frequency information without explicit transformations, achieving high performance with reduced computational cost. Our analysis indicates that the main spectral variations between the clear and degraded images are centred on the high-frequency components in the feature maps; the convolution operator tends to amplify the amplitude and variance of these components. Building on this observation, we designed an Implicit Frequency Selection Module (IFSM) to enrich high-frequency components and an Implicit Frequency Selection Attention (IFSA) mechanism to emphasize and integrate beneficial frequency features. We integrated and optimized design elements from existing image restoration models to further refine the overall architecture of IFSR-Net. Extensive experiments across seven datasets and three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Ablation studies confirm the validity of our design choices, offering insights for future research in image restoration.},

  abstract     = {The composition of the password is markedly disparate contingent on the configuration strategy and the individual user&#39;s predilections. The objective of this paper is to mine the region attribute information behind the password text through text classification. In contrast to the traditional text classification approach, the classification of password region attribution represents a distinct challenge namely ultra-short text classification. The issue of password regional attribute classification is particularly tricky due to its inherent lexical polysemy, the scarcity of text features, the lack of context and the difficulty in explicitly identifying semantics. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a multi-granularity cascade fusion approach for password region attribution classification. Firstly, the model employs series of segmentation techniques to split password into multi-dimensional fine-grained subword representations. Subsequently, multiple segmented representations of the same password are fed into a localised feature encoder to mine the private local features. Finally, a multi-level cascade fusion method is designed to integrate different granularity of password features into a unified representation to classification. Our approach can effectively addresses the limitations of scarce information and the challenge of integrating multiple representations for password text. Experiments on a large amount of real password data demonstrate that, our model can converge rapidly and achieve an accuracy of 88.18%, a precision of 88.31%, a recall of 87.73%, and an F1-score of 88.02%, significantly outperforming traditional models.},

  abstract     = {In several domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, automatic data labelling is a critical task. Automatic data labelling is the process of utilising machine learning techniques to automatically label substantial amounts of data. Two largest news datasets like, the Kaggle dataset and the AG News dataset are used as benchmark for the performance analysis of the proposed algorithms. A novel four-dimensional matrix-based input representation that depicts the intra – and inter-word associations is used to obtain the feature vectors. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) helps to remove the outliers which improves the overall accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The proposed approach also reduces the dependency on human annotators. The DBSCAN algorithm is utilised o automatically cluster similar data points, thereby reducing the need for manual labelling. These clusters are then fed into a CNN with a rethinking mechanism, which allows the network to revise its initial predictions based on additional context. This integration of clustering and deep learning techniques aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency. The cloud computing method is used to achieve high-throughput news headlines classification in order to achieve accurate and efficient data labelling.},

Subsequently, this work evaluates the competence of the proposed FS mode using ten benchmark NASA datasets on four supervised learning classifiers, namely NB, DT, SVM, and KNN using accuracy and error curve as the standard performance measure metrics. This paper also correlates the proposed FS mode&#39;s conduct with existing FS techniques based on widely utilized meta-heuristic approaches such as GA, PSO, DE, ACO, FA, and SWO. This work employed Friedman and Holm test to ratify the proposed FS mode&#39;s statistical connotation. The investigatory outcomes supported the assertion that the recommended DAOAFS mode was effective in enhancing the efficacy of the defect forecasting model by achieving the highest mean accuracy of 94.76%. The findings also revealed that the proposed approach established its supremacy over the other studied FS techniques with bettered veracity in most instances.},

However, the sensitive nature of such kind of data inevitably leads to privacy constraints and regulations on its use and sharing. This paper addresses the problem in a distinctive perspective. Instead of blurring or modifying original trajectory samples, we aim to generate a completely synthetic dataset, whose samples are singularly different from the original ones, but whose collective sets share similar global characteristics and performances. We propose a generative deep learning solution for location-based trajectory formats, with the goal of producing realistic synthetic location sequences: the process relies on a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, involving long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent layers to capture trajectory characteristics, and neural embeddings to model mobility relations between places. We leverage multiple metrics to assess the realistic character of synthetic data and their similarity with the original source; moreover, we evaluate downstream performance differences with regard to the next place prediction problem. Tested on a real-world large-scale dataset of long-distance trips, and compared with baselines and traditional geomasking techniques, our approach presents better characteristics, providing novel insights into GeoAI solutions for human mobility analysis.},

This study presents a novel Two-Level Multimodal Data Fusion Integrated Incremental Learner Ensemble Classifier (TMDFILE) for Alzheimer&#39;s detection. This method integrates temporal, spatial, spectral, audio, and text data modalities, utilising a gating mechanism to optimise the contribution of each modality.

The proposed model is evaluated in four different stock market datasets which include FSTE, SSE, Nifty 50 and S&amp;P 500.

  abstract     = {Heart sounds, or phonocardiograms (PCG), are important for diagnosing cardiovascular conditions, providing a non-invasive means to assess heart function through auscultation. Accurate classification of PCG signals can facilitate early detection of cardiac abnormalities, significantly improving patient outcomes. However, the complexity and variability of heart sound recordings present significant challenges for traditional classification methods, necessitating advanced approaches that can effectively handle the nuances of cardiac acoustics. This paper introduces a novel transfer learning approach that adapts OpenAI&#39;s Whisper model, originally designed for robust speech recognition, to the task of heart sound classification. In particular, we employ Whisper&#39;s encoder architecture to effectively capture acoustic features that generalize to cardiac auscultation, making it a promising candidate for PCG analysis. To tailor the model for this specialized task, we implement a modified encoder architecture optimized for heart sound characteristics. We process the input to the model using a Log-Mel spectrogram pipeline specifically designed to highlight the unique acoustic properties of PCG signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the adapted Whisper model achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in both accuracy and robustness.},

While prior research addresses this NP-hard problem, most approaches depend on hybrid metaheuristics requiring expertise in hybridisation and lack systematic methods for architecture selection, often relying on a single criterion with trial-and-error parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative parallel hybridisation framework that integrates Thompson sampling and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to holistically evaluate and identify the best hybrid architecture from a diverse set of options. Unlike conventional approaches, our method employs onboard Taguchi design of experiments (DOE) for structured and efficient parameter tuning. Additionally, Thompson sampling, applied in the form of Bayesian learning, mitigates the stochastic nature of metaheuristics through multiple experiments. This framework was used to select the best architecture from 57 hybrid combinations of six metaheuristics for solving RCPSP-DC. Extensive experiments using standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves statistically significant performance improvements, selecting a hybrid architecture that outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The selected architecture’s competitiveness is validated through a Z-test of proportions, underscoring its effectiveness in solving RCPSP-DC problems.},

Therefore, we explore the effectiveness of various ML models by incorporating domain-specific term weighting and utilising word embeddings. The study also analyses the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with and without bidirectional connections, as well as an approach that combines RNNs and CNN. Furthermore, we evaluate several transformer-based models by fine-tuning them alongside GenAI models text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo, PaLM2, and Gemini Pro in zero-shot classification settings. The results demonstrate that ML models outperformed DL models, achieving a best accuracy of 0.871 and F1 score of 0.872. Additionally, domain-specific term weighting is found to be superior to word embeddings. Furthermore, most ML and DL models performed better than GenAI models, with GenAI models achieving a best accuracy of 0.618 and a best F1 score of 0.627.

This study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the robustness dynamics of SML techniques under more complex scenarios, such as adversarial perturbations and geometric transformation. Five popular classification algorithms, including k-nearest neighbour and support vector machines, were employed to build classification models. Methodology involves investigating the robustness of proposed  methods, first, on original and corrupted data by utilising benchmark datasets across several image domains. To strengthen the investigation, the models were trained using a new low-rank representation (LRR) strategy. This hybrid model simultaneously addresses two key limitations in classical LRR models: overcoming the sequential learning process and effectively capturing both local and global data structures. By introducing a dual regularisation mechanism, it integrates a k-nearest neighbour graph to preserve local consistency, while a global low-rank constraint ensures coherent data representation. Experimental results reveal significant drops in accuracy of most SML methods, especially under adversarial attacks and geometric transformations, but LRR approach mitigates these effects to a notable extent, boosting performance across data variations. The results also show that the proposed  method outperforms state-of-the-art LRR techniques in most experiments.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the prediction of student performance is still complicated to analyze the talent of individuals and the effort to improve their academic performance. Moreover, the researchers are performed to analyze the outcomes of student performance but the educational database consists of a huge data volume, which is hard to train the small sample. In this research work, a new hybrid deep learning model with optimized entropy rough set theory is developed to predict the student’s performance accurately. The preprocessing phase is performed with outlier removal and the data-filling method. The features are mined from the preprocessed data by Entropy weighted Rough set-based feature mining. A novel meta-heuristic hybrid Galactic Rider Swarm Optimization (GRSO) algorithm is developed for feature mining. A hybrid deep learning-based Convolutional Recurrent Network (CRN) is implemented for prediction, where the classification performance is improved by the GRSO algorithm. Here, the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are optimized by the GRSO algorithm. Here, the sensitivity and accuracy rate of the recommended GRSO-CRN method attain 94% and 93%. The simulation outcome of the proposed GRSO-CRN model achieves enriched performance.},

To overcome some shortcomings of SWOT analysis, an integrated SWOT analysis, fuzzy net present value (FNPV), and fuzzy Shapley value (FSV) methodology was proposed in the present study as a conceptual framework to cost-effectively achieve and manage the objectives for efficiency, capacity, and availability as well as to provide practical insights on how to formulate strategic decisions. The fuzzy net present value method was used to determine the strategic importance of the SWOT matrix. Taking into account the theoretical foundation of the cooperative games, the fuzzy Shapley value was used to determine the optimal combination of SWOT matrix strategies to effectively overcome the ambiguities and uncertainty of real-world conditions. In the game, any type of strategy (WT, WO, ST, and SO) was considered as a player who had partial freedom to make some choices.

MPA integrating U-shape slots are renowned for including comparatively larger bandwidth impedance (around 30%). This article aims to develop an optimized U-slot MPA design, where the antenna measurements such as patch height or board thickness, patch length, patch width, and feed diameter are optimally tuned by a new hybrid optimization model. As the concepts of Dingo Optimization and Black Widow Optimization are combined, the adopted algorithm is called Black Widow in Dingo Model with Logistic Chaotic Map. The priority of the introduced scheme is examined via the assessment over existing models by varying the frequency ranges, and cost analysis is also done for varied iterations.},

  abstract     = {Watermarking is a technique for protecting multimedia data, mainly images, from malicious attacks by adding a signature into these images. Traditional watermarking techniques, unfortunately, have drawbacks when used on sensitive images like those used in medicine. A reliable and blind watermarking method is suggested in this work to protect medical picture transferred in telemedicine. Medical picture marking enables accurate patient identification, prevents scan confusion, and minimizes the risk of diagnostic mistakes that could have negative consequences. In this method, three distinct transforms are used to acquire the frequency content of the image. The low frequency subbands are subsequently subjected to Schur decomposition. In order to incorporate the watermark bits, the resultant upper triangular matrix values are modified. The proposed approaches effectively retain a considerable quality of watermarked images and are impressively resistant against numerous conventional attacks, according to imperceptibility and robustness experimental results. The average Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which was obtained was 44.90 dB, demonstrating that the integration procedure produces very low distortion to the original image. The observed results for robustness demonstrate that the watermark is resilient to the most of the attacks performed in watermarking, with a normalized cross correlation rate higher than 0.9.},

This article studies a distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with a mixed-model assembly line (DHHFSP-MMAL), which consists of manufacturing and assembly stages. The DHHFSP-MMAL is modelled by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Three constructive heuristics and a parallel deep adaptive large neighbourhood search (PDALNS) problem are presented. A constructive heuristic with a group strategy is employed to obtain an initial solution. Several deep destroy-and-repair operators are proposed where problem-specific greedy local search methods are applied. The PDALNS assigns weights to destroy-and-repair operators to guide the selection of operators. The parallel computing technique is introduced to increase the efficiency of training. The experiments demonstrate that the PDALNS algorithm is an efficient and effective algorithm for solving the DHHFSP-MMAL problem.},

Most importantly, the subspace variables are updated in each iteration, according to the variable interaction analyses in the sub- and full-spaces. The perturbation method and the analysis of variance are used to detect variable interactions. After being validated on 21 benchmark functions ranging from 30 to 90 dimensions, the DA-EGO is used for the optimization of a transonic compressor rotor with 28 variables and a multi-stage compressor optimization with 60 variables. With the above, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is well demonstrated.},

In the competitive strategy, krill individuals with poor fitness are replaced with robust ‘competitive krill’ to accelerate global convergence. Then, the experimental results from CEC2017 benchmark functions demonstrate that, compared with other algorithms, CCKH shows superiority in most cases. Finally, six structural optimizations are used to evaluate the robustness of CCKH compared with other techniques. It is found that as the complexity of the structure increases, the competitiveness of CCKH becomes more pronounced, and the time complexity of the presented method is not affected by the two strategies.},

It is based on the idea of adaptive surrogate model-based optimization substituting the tolerance analysis subroutine with a surrogate model, which is iteratively re-modelled with intermediate optimization results to improve its accuracy continuously in potential optima regions. On the one hand, a directed intensification of promising solutions and, on the other hand, an accelerated exploration of the search space is achieved.

  abstract     = {Shape optimization is important for improving the performance of mechanical components. In the past, gradient based optimization methods using the elegant adjoint formalism dominated the field. Gradient descent optimization, however, tends to get stuck in local minima if the optimization problem is non-convex. In this article, an improved approach to shape optimization is proposed that is capable of overcoming local minima. It is motivated by gradient based training methods in machine learning, which involve momentum. Here, the momentum method is derived from the formalism of dissipative Hamiltonian flows, which generalize gradient flows. While gradient descent can be seen as an Euler scheme discretization of the gradient flow, a symplectic Euler scheme is proposed in this article to discretize the Hamiltonian dynamics for the momentum method. To show the efficiency of the method, it is applied to a shape optimization problem involving ceramic components, with reliability, volume and avoidance of construction space constraints as target functions. Construction space constraints lead to manifestly non-convex shape optimization problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method solves these non-convex problems more efficiently than the traditional gradient descent approach.},

  abstract     = {Battery packs are vital components for storing and releasing energy. However, during driving, the intensity of heat emission and mechanical performance of electric vehicles are interrelated but conflicting indicators. To address this problem, this study topologically optimizes the power pack support structure with multiple objectives of minimizing compliance and heat dissipation, aiming to achieve a comprehensive and integrated design scheme. A floating projection topology optimization (FPTO) method is proposed, which normalizes the objectives of structural compliance and heat dissipation and derives the sensitivity. FPTO demonstrates superior objective function values and smoother topology configuration compared to the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the power pack support structure. The results demonstrate that the method obtains a design solution with excellent mechanical performance and high heat dissipation performance with a suitable trade-off. The lightweight design of the overall structure of the battery pack is achieved.},

  abstract     = {Group technology is a managerial strategy used to optimize production by reducing setup times, lead times, and work-in-process inventories. Research on flow-shop sequence-dependent group scheduling problems (FSDGSPs) has primarily focused on minimizing makespan and total flow time to improve efficiency. However, the need for energy-efficient scheduling in FSDGSPs remains underexplored despite increasing sustainability concerns. To address this, the energy-efficient flow-shop sequence-dependent group scheduling problem (EEFSDGSP) is introduced. A novel multi-objective optimization (MOO) technique, the artificial neural network-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (ANN-MOGA), is proposed to minimize makespan and energy consumption in EEFSDGSP. ANN-MOGA advances MOO by using a neural network to evaluate fitness and guide selection, reducing computational complexity versus traditional methods like NSGA-II and SPEA2. A post-processing step (PPANNS) further enhances solution diversity and distribution. Results show ANN-MOGA, especially with PPANNS, outperforms NSGA-II and competes effectively with SPEA2 in larger problem instances.},

The proposed method has two main features. First, the number of nonlinear terms in the stability conditions is independent of the number of switched system modes. The result is that the computational cost is reduced, and it can be applied to switched systems with a large number of subsystems. Second, using switched Lyapunov functions, hybrid switching laws are designed to preserve the practical stability property in both the closed-loop state-dependent switching function and the open-loop time-dependent one. As a result, when the state data is lost during sensor or communication failures, the controller can change the control scheme from a closed-loop state-dependent switching function to an open-loop time-dependent one without loss of stability property. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.},

Since the dead-zone phenomenon is frequently encountered in the control of nonlinear strict feedback system, it is very necessary to consider the effect of dead-zone in the OB control. However, the published OB control methods are to rarely deal with the dead-zone problem because of the complex algorithm of reinforcement learning (RL). In this OB control, the dead-zone problem is effectively solved by utilising a simplified RL algorithm. For effective eliminating the effect of dead-zone, an adaptive compensation of dead-zone function&#39;s remainder is added to this RL. Since the RL under identifier-critic-actor architecture is implemented in every backstepping step, the requirement of complete dynamic acknowledge is released.

The linear part is designed to solve the main regulation problem, while the nonlinear part is designed to enhance the performance of the closed-loop system in the face of input saturation. The delay-range dependent stability conditions of the closed-loop system are analysed using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) approach, which involves solving an LMI problem to determine the parameters of the proposed controller. Furthermore, the admissibility of the closed-loop system is assessed to ensure the system’s stability, regularity, and causality.

Specifically, we add a kind of nonnegative impulses which is consistent with the switching behaviours for the systems. We first study switched homogeneous positive nonlinear systems (SHPNS) case, then we extend the SHPNS to a time-varying SHNS case. The primary difficulty of this research is the estimation of Lyapunov function value at switching-impulse points under the coupling effects of synchronous switches and state jumps. By employing the max-separable Lyapunov function approach, we present new sufficient stability criteria and design new switching-impulse signals, and successfully establish the new relation between the average dwell time parameter and impulse strength. Then, we apply the obtained results to the time-varying vehicle formation model with impulses.

Subsequently, a disturbance-dependent reaching law, built upon the exponential model, is developed to ensure the Lyapunov stability of the system and to attenuate its ultimate bandwidth. Furthermore, an analysis is conducted on the stability condition between the exponential and disturbance-dependent reaching laws, illustrating that the designed referred sliding phase optimises the ultimate bandwidth.

In contrast to traditional DOBC, the proposed approach employs RBFNN technology to approximate unknown nonlinear functions in the system, instead of treating them as part of lumped disturbances. A novel disturbance observer is developed to estimate disturbances characterised by a nonlinear exogenous system. To enhance control performance, a PPF that characterises both transient and steady-state behaviour is used for the transformation of tracking errors. It can be proved that all the states of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), and that the tracking error evolves within the prespecified boundaries.

  abstract     = {We propose an adaptive algorithm for identifying the unknown parameter (possibly vector-valued) in a linear stable single-input single-output infinite-dimensional system. We assume that the transfer function of the infinite-dimensional system can be expressed as a ratio of two infinite series in s (the Laplace variable). We also assume that certain identifiability conditions, which include a persistency of excitation condition, hold. For a fixed integer n , we propose an adaptive update law (a differential equation in time) driven by real-time input-output data for estimating the first n + 1 coefficients in the numerator and the denominator of the transfer function. We show that the estimates for the transfer function coefficients generated by the update law are close to the true values at large times provided n is sufficiently large (the estimates converge to the true values as time and n tend to infinity). The unknown parameter can be reconstructed using the transfer function coefficient estimates obtained with n large and the algebraic expressions relating the transfer function coefficients to the unknown parameter. We also provide a numerical scheme for verifying the identifiability conditions and for choosing n sufficiently large so that the value of the reconstructed parameter is close to the true value. The class of systems to which our approach is applicable includes many partial differential equations with constant/spatially-varying coefficients and distributed/boundary input and output.

For this new class of control problems, we establish and characterise Wolfe, Mond-Weir and mixed type robust dual models.

Then an adaptive finite-time ELM-based velocity observer is developed to estimate the unavailable velocity states. Further, based on the estimations and the approximations of model uncertainties, an adaptive finite-time observer-based nonsingular terminal sliding mode (TSM) control strategy is constructed to guarantee the finite-time bounded tracking of the uncertain EL system by using the Lyapunov stability theorem.

  abstract     = {Extensive research has been conducted in dynamic mathematical problems and real-time industrial control applications, leading to the emergence of zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) as a significant approach. This approach is guided by the fluctuating tendency of state errors, and a link is established between the stability of the zero solution in the neurodynamic system and the convergence of neuron states in a zeroing neural network. Over the last two decades, considerable efforts have been made by numerous scholars to advance the development of ZND, resulting in the formation of a series of ZND models for various mathematical issues and real-world applications. In this paper, the advances in ZND are synthesised from three aspects: models, theories, and applications. Specifically, ZND models are categorised into two main frameworks based on their structures and further classified into different types depending on the dynamics of the specific models under each framework. The two main frameworks identified are the foundational ZND framework and the integral ZND framework. The former serves as the basic structure for exponential type ZND, finite-time type ZND, fixed-time type ZND, and predefined-time type ZND, while the latter is extended with the single-integral type ZND and the double-integral type ZND. Furthermore, the primary analytical methods for the dynamics of each type of ZND are summarised, and the current applications of ZND, including robot manipulator control, multi-agent consistency, dynamic positioning, chaos synchronisation, and image processing, are introduced. Through this survey, a comprehensive understanding of the development history of ZND research, the current research focuses and challenges in ZND models, theories, and applications, as well as future directions and key breakthroughs in ZND research, will be provided to readers.},

And scalar filter gains are derived by using fixed-point iterative update rules, resulting in enhanced performance against non-Gaussian noises. A distributed approach to determine an optimal weight matrix is developed by using the upper bounds of the filtering error covariance, balancing the trade-off between estimated states and measurements at different scales.

Then, by viewing the output of observer as the reference signal, a distributed resilient controller is designed for each follower to address the reference-tracking problem. By introducing a smooth function with positive integrable time-varying function, novel adaptive laws are developed and incorporated with the controller design to effectively compensate for the unknown time-varying parameters. By utilising Lyapunov stability theory, the asymptotic convergence of output regulation error can be ensured.

To address this issue, this work proposes a controller design based on a balanced truncated model that effectively contains the dominant dynamics of the single link flexible manipulator system, which substantially reduces the computational cost of controller implementation while also simplifying the design process. Further, the work also proposes a strategy to design a robust functional observer-based output feedback sliding mode controller for position control of the single link flexible manipulator.

The main work is as follows: First, a DAETM is considered to allocate network resources properly and resist data injection attacks. Then, a data buffer is adopted to consolidate data from decentralised channels for ensuring timely utilisation. In addition, a controller gain condition is presented to achieve the bumpless switching between subsystems. Moreover, by adopting piecewise Lyapunov function method, sufficient conditions are obtained for triggered switched systems to be exponentially stable and anti-bump under injection attacks.

This paper aims to address finite-region dissipativity and dissipative control for a class of Fornasini-Marchesini local state-space (FMLSS) type 2-D switched systems. The analysis employs the mode-dependent average dwell time approach. Firstly, the concept of dissipativity on finite-region for 2-D switched systems is introduced. Then, a sufficient condition under which the considered systems can demonstrate the finite-region boundedness with the external disturbances is established by the special recursive formulas. Additionally, a sufficient condition for finite-region dissipativity of the considered systems is provided. Furthermore, the dissipative state feedback controller is derived to ensure the finite-region dissipativity of the closed-loop systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design approach, an example is presented.},

First, based on the fractional-order monotonicity theorem and the definition of conformable fractional-order derivative, novel conformable fractional-order Halanay inequalities are developed that extend and improve the existing ones. Second, using the obtained Halanay inequalities and the estimate of conformable fractional-order exponential functions, globally exponential stability conditions that depend on the infimum and supremum of impulsive step sizes are proposed for the systems. Third, more relaxing stability conditions are presented that do not depend on the infimum and supremum of impulsive step sizes, which means that the conditions on impulses are weaker than those commonly used in the existing literature. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the validity of the theoretical results.},

Then, by constructing a suitable fractional-order Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are presented to analyse the stability of the consensus error system in finite time.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem for a class of polytopic uncertain systems under the decode and forward cooperative relay protocol (DFCP). In order to combat signal fading from sensors to controllers and improve communication reliability, spatial diversity is achieved through cooperative terminal relay signals. At each transmission instant, the terminal only selects a better signal for transmission and a switched system is constructed. The aim of this paper is to design a set of desired dynamic output feedback controllers in the framework of RMPC such that the switched system with the underlying DFCP is exponentially stable. By taking the influence of the randomness of DFCP derived from a three nodes model composed of DF relay, a new objective function based on the mathematical expectation of the traditional quadratic function of MPC is established. Then, the orthogonal complement technique is applied to handle the inherent couplings of variables to formulate a solvable optimisation problem. Moreover, the sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the recursive feasibility of the MPC strategy and the stability of the established closed-loop system in terms of the average dwell time (ADT) method. Finally, three experiments are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem for a class of systems with polytopic uncertainties and persistent bounded disturbances in the long-distance transmission environment. The signal transmitted over a long distance is very likely to be destroyed by the channel fading. To address this issue, an amplify-and-forward cooperation protocol (AFCP) is adopted in the forward channel, i.e. from sensor nodes to the remote controller node, to improve the transmission quality. Considering the difficulty of obtaining the system state in practice, the dynamic output feedback control in the framework of RMPC is put forward. With respect to the parameter uncertainty, persistent bounded disturbances, and randomness of the transmission power stored in sensors and the AF relay, the objective function is defined by the mathematical expectation of a quadratic function over the infinite time horizon. Then, based on this establishment, a ‘min–max’ optimisation problem is readily formulated. Furthermore, the singular value decomposition technique is utilised to mitigate the non-convexity and formulate an auxiliary optimisation problem with the solvability, meanwhile, the sufficient criterion for the mean-square input-to-state stability of the underlying system is obtained. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Through comprehensive numerical experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of our observer in two distinct scenarios. Firstly, we demonstrate its application in synchronising a 4-component chaotic dynamical system. Secondly, we showcase its utility in tracking a reduced 2-component chemical engineering process. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed observer outperforms existing methods by achieving quicker convergence and higher estimation accuracy.

Based on the above incomplete information, state feedback controllers are established to fulfil stochastic finite-time boundedness of switched stochastic systems and make it have a certain disturbance attenuation capability, i.e. have a finite-time L 2 -gain, successfully.

With this formula, we present a precise counterpart to compute the credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness of coherent trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Leveraging these analytical formulations, we construct a novel tri-objective portfolio selection problem, integrating credibilistic mean, semivariance, and skewness as objectives, along with some practical constraints. When used with the returns of the portfolio as a whole, the derived analytical expressions help to overcome the otherwise computationally expensive approach involving the simulation of results using individual assets&#39; returns. The proposed model is solved by adapting an efficient multiobjective genetic algorithm. The algorithm has been specifically designed to solve portfolio selection models of this type. The efficiency of the proposed model is then demonstrated by taking a real-world scenario of financial stock market datasets from the NSE India. Based on the results of this study, it appears that the proposed novel tri-objective portfolio selection model produces promising results compared to the baseline model and the NIFTY 50 Index considered as a benchmark.},

Despite their promise, ML algorithms may fail to accurately ascertain heterogeneous treatment effects under practical settings with many covariates and small sample size. In addition, the quantification of estimation uncertainty remains a challenge. We develop a general approach to statistical inference for heterogeneous treatment effects discovered by a generic ML algorithm. We apply the Neyman’s repeated sampling framework to a common setting, in which researchers use an ML algorithm to estimate the conditional average treatment effect and then divide the sample into several groups based on the magnitude of the estimated effects. We show how to estimate the average treatment effect within each of these groups, and construct a valid confidence interval. In addition, we develop nonparametric tests of treatment effect homogeneity across groups, and rank-consistency of within-group average treatment effects. The validity of our methodology does not rely on the properties of ML algorithms because it is solely based on the randomization of treatment assignment and random sampling of units. Finally, we generalize our methodology to the cross-fitting procedure by accounting for the additional uncertainty induced by the random splitting of data.},

Given two probability distributions P (null) and Q (alternative), we study the problem of detecting weak distribution shift deviating from the null P toward the alternative Q , where the level of deviation vanishes as a function of n , the sample size. We propose a model for weak distribution shifts via displacement interpolation between P and Q , drawing from the optimal transport theory. We study a hypothesis testing procedure based on the Wasserstein distance, derive sharp conditions under which detection is possible, and provide the exact characterization of the asymptotic Type I and Type II errors at the detection boundary using empirical processes. We demonstrate how the proposed testing procedure works in modeling and detecting weak distribution shifts in real datasets using two empirical examples: distribution shifts in consumer spending after COVID-19, and heterogeneity in the published p -values of statistical tests in journals across different disciplines.},

In this article we study the finite sample and asymptotic properties of various weighting estimators of the local average treatment effect (LATE), motivated by Abadie’s kappa theorem and offering the requisite flexibility relative to standard practice. We argue that two of the estimators under consideration, which are weight normalized, are generally preferable. Several other estimators, which are unnormalized, do not satisfy the properties of scale invariance with respect to the natural logarithm and translation invariance, thereby exhibiting sensitivity to the units of measurement when estimating the LATE in logs and the centering of the outcome variable more generally. We also demonstrate that, when noncompliance is one sided, certain weighting estimators have the advantage of being based on a denominator that is strictly greater than zero by construction. This is the case for only one of the two normalized estimators, and we recommend this estimator for wider use. We illustrate our findings with a simulation study and three empirical applications, which clearly document the sensitivity of unnormalized estimators to how the outcome variable is coded. We implement the proposed estimators in the Stata package kappalate .},

To account for effects from dominant (popular) units, the spatial weights matrix in our model can allow for unbounded column sums. To account for heterogeneity, our model includes two-way fixed effects and heteroscedastic errors. We further consider the potential endogeneity of the spatial weight matrix constructed from socioeconomic distance. We investigate the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE), generalized methods of moments estimator (GMME), and root estimator (RTE), and establish their consistency and asymptotic normality based on the near epoch dependence (NED) framework. The RTE can derive a relatively computationally simple and closed-form solution without evaluating the QMLE’s Jacobian matrix as well as the iterations by GMME. We consider both n , T → ∞ , and the strength of the dominant units is equal to 1 when T → ∞ . For the purpose of empirical analysis, we derive the marginal effects and their limiting distributions based on the proposed estimators. In an empirical application, we apply our model to China’s prefecture city-level data, revealing significant spillover effects of the tertiary industry share. These findings suggest that the development of the tertiary sector in large cities can foster its growth in small cities.},

However, quantifying the magnitude of this dependence remains difficult. This article extends Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis, widely used in classical simulation, to compute asymptotically unbiased and consistent sensitivities of posterior statistics with respect to prior parameters from Markov chain Monte Carlo inference via Gibbs sampling. The method demonstrates the possibility of efficiently computing the complete set of prior sensitivities for a wide range of posterior statistics, alongside the estimation algorithm using Automatic Differentiation. The method’s application is exemplified in Bayesian Vector Autoregression analysis of fiscal policy in U.S. macroeconomic time series data. The analysis assesses the sensitivities of posterior estimates, including the Impulse response functions and Forecast error variance decompositions, to prior parameters under common Minnesota shrinkage priors. The findings illuminate the significant and intricate influence of prior specification on the posterior distribution. This effect is particularly notable in crucial posterior statistics, such as the substantial absolute eigenvalue of the companion matrix, ultimately shaping the structural analysis.},

This modeling framework is over-simplified and faces the risk of misspecification when constructing the weights matrices. In this article, we propose a novel reduced-rank spatio-temporal model by assuming the coefficient matrices follow a reduced-rank structure. This specification avoids construction of the weights matrices and provides a good interpretation, especially for financial data. To estimate the unknown parameters, a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) is proposed and obtained via the Gradient descent algorithm with Armijo line search. We establish the asymptotic properties of QMLE when the number of units and the number of time periods both diverge to infinity. To determine the rank, we propose a ridge-type ratio estimator and demonstrate its rank selection consistency. The proposed methodology is illustrated via extensive simulation studies. Finally, a Chinese stock dataset is analyzed to investigate the cross-sectional and temporal spillover effects among stock returns.},

We first identify quantile policy effects under the unconfoundedness assumption and propose an inverse probability weighting estimator. We then examine the asymptotic behavior of the proposed estimator in a time series framework and suggest a blockwise bootstrap method for inference. Applying this method, we investigate the effectiveness of U.S. macroprudential actions on bank credit growth from 1948 to 2019. Empirically, we find that the effects of macroprudential policy on credit growth are asymmetric and depend on the quantiles of credit growth. The tightening of macroprudential actions fails to rein in high credit growth, whereas easing policies do not effectively stimulate bank credit growth during low-growth periods. These findings suggest that U.S. macroprudential policies might not sufficiently address the challenges of soaring bank credit or ensure overarching financial stability.},

  abstract     = {We generalize the Max Share approach to allow for simultaneous identification of a multiplicity of shocks in a Structural Vector Autoregression. Our machinery therefore overcomes the well-known drawbacks that individually identified shocks (i) tend to be correlated to each other or (ii) can be separated under orthogonalizations with weak economic ground. We show that identification corresponds to solving a nontrivial optimization problem. We provide conditions for non-emptiness of solutions and point-identification, and Bayesian algorithms for estimation and inference. We use the approach to study the effects of uncertainty and financial shocks, allowing for the possibility that the former responds contemporaneously to other shocks, distinguishing macroeconomic from financial uncertainty and credit supply shocks. Using U.S. data we find that financial uncertainty mimics a demand shock, while the interpretation of macro uncertainty is more mixed. Furthermore, variation in uncertainty partially represents the endogenous response of uncertainty to other shocks.},

  abstract     = {Vocalizations are the most prominent signals in the communication of anuran amphibians. Frog calls can serve different roles depending on the social context. There are three categories of vocal signals (calls) based on social context. One of these is the aggressive call, which generally mediates interactions between conspecific males and conveys information about the level of aggression. In this study, we describe fighting calls elicited during physical combat between two males of Pithecopus ayeaye . We also analyzed aggressive calls not associated with physical combat, which were emitted by resident males from an established calling site toward approaching males, and discussed the variation related to different levels of aggression. The fighting call consists of one multi-pulsed note with an increment in sound amplitude throughout the note and amplitude peak by 96% of note duration. In general, fighting calls and aggressive calls have the same temporal envelope and spectral features. However, fighting calls exhibit a greater number of pulses, a higher pulse repetition rate, and a longer duration. The differences between aggressive calls of P. ayeaye produced in distinct contexts could indicate a graded signaling system in the aggressive calling behavior of the species. Our data match the pattern of escalated aggressive behavior occurring in other vocal anurans by modulating spectral and/or temporal features of their calls.},

  abstract     = {Climate change has interfered with ecosystem stability, biodiversity and predator–prey interactions. Among amphibians, temperature variations may influence metabolism, sensory perception and behavior. We experimentally evaluated whether tadpoles of map treefrog, Boana geographica , reduce their activity and increase the use of refuge under different temperatures in response to chemical signals emitted by a predator, as an adaptive strategy to minimize the risk of predation. Tadpoles’ shelter use and feeding behavior was measured at temperatures from 28 to 36 °C using control (without predator cues) and treatment (predator cues) groups. Temperature influenced the shelter use of tadpoles when exposed to predator chemical cues. Significant differences were observed at lower temperatures and greater shelter use by tadpoles at higher temperatures. Food offering showed no significant difference in the control or treatment group. The increased use of shelter by tadpoles in response to chemical signals from predators and increased temperature highlights the adaptive capacity of organisms in the face of predation threats, highlighting the complexity of predator–prey interactions. This behavior highlights the role of environmental factors and sensory signals in shaping the survival strategies of aquatic ectotherms. Tadpoles minimize predation risk by increasing predator avoidance behavior in detecting chemical signals in the water.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, the Magpie, which has ecological and behavioral flexibility, has colonized many cities. In this study, we examine the effect of urban disturbance on nesting density of the Magpie and nest height in a city in the south-eastern Baltic region. The studies were carried out in Kaliningrad (54°43’N, 20°30’E) during the leafless period in 2018–2021 in green residential areas with a predominance of 5-storey buildings (“residential area”) and low-rise individual housing areas (“individual houses”). In the residential area, nest counts were carried out separately in the central part of the city and outside the city center. Based on literature data on urban populations of the Magpie in other cities, we predict that: (1) in the central part of the city there will be a higher nesting density of magpies and (2) in the central part of the city, nests will be located higher than outside the central part of the city. The results obtained did not confirm these assumptions. The average nesting density in residential areas in the city center and outside the city center was virtually the same. And, in addition, in the residential area in the city center, nests were on average located lower than in the residential area outside the central part of the city, but the differences were not statistically significant and the median values of these city zones coincide. The work also provides data on the placement of nests on various types of trees and shrubs. The Hooded crow, being the main predator and competitor of the Magpie, shares the same habitats in Kaliningrad. This coexistence could potentially slow down the increase in Magpie nesting density, especially in the residential area of the city centre, where the nesting density of the Hooded crow is significantly higher than outside the city centre.},

  abstract     = {One of the important antipredator benefits of group living for prey species is collective vigilance that enhances early predator detection. Within the group, individuals monitor the behavior of others to gauge the level of risk in the environment. The nearest-neighbor distance is important as the information travels quickly and easily from the nearest individuals. I examined the vigilance behavior of free-ranging chital deer ( Axis axis , Gir Protected Area, India) in response to the group size, nearest neighbor distance, and habitat structure (open versus dense vegetation). The vigilance behavior showed a weak negative response to increases in group size. Overall, the vigilance levels were significantly higher for animals that had distant neighbors. There was a significant interaction effect of habitat structure and the nearest neighbor distance on vigilance levels of chitals. However, this effect was only significantly different for individuals living in dense vegetation. Chitals respond more strongly to conspecific vigilance from their nearest companion in the denser mixed forest than open acacia grasslands. The results indicate that nearest neighbor distance and habitat structure interact in determining the vigilance behavior of group living ungulates and transmission of information within a social group.},

Geladas ( Theropithecus gelada ) are endemic primates of the Ethiopian highlands and the last remaining member of the genus Theropithecus . We present here the first-ever study on the behavioral ecology, of the newly discovered geladas in the eastern part of Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. We collected data from February to September 2020, which included both dry and wet seasons, and focused on activity patterns and feeding ecology of geladas. A band of 48 individuals was selected as a study group. Data was collected through the instantaneous scan sampling method from the focal band of geladas. Feeding accounted for 49.5% of the activity patterns, followed by moving (22.3%), resting (16%), social (10.4%), and other non-social activities (1.9%). Geladas in the present study consumed 25 plant species that belong to 12 families, more than 50% (14) being graminoids. Food items included graminoid parts (66.1%), forb parts (27.5%), tree/shrub leaves (2.4%), fruit/seeds (2.6%), flowers (0.9%), and the rest being unidentified (0.5%). Geladas are fed in large quantities on graminoid leaves, although they shifted to underground (corms, rhizomes, and roots) food items when leaves were desiccated, particularly during the dry season. The data on the diurnal activity patterns and feeding ecology of the gelada helps in developing conservation strategies and understanding habitat selection and its level of dietary specialization. The current study area is known as a new distribution of geladas in the Tigray region. Thus, this study provides data that would be crucial information for conservation practitioners at local and national levels to ensure the survival of the new and isolated population of Tigray geladas that are patchily distributed to a few escarpments of eastern Tigray, Ethiopia.},

The populations were infected enterically with the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 55 generations followed by rearing for the next 10 generations under relaxed selection. We tested development of immune-competence of the selected flies through the generations and inquired if elicitation of immune responses were needed to pay cost by trading-off with life history and morphological traits and observed progressive increase in immune response in the selected flies, which also exhibited gradual increase in survival, reproductive life span, post-reproductive life span, developmental time, fecundity rate, fat content in contrast to body length and water content that exhibited longitudinal decrease. Under relaxed selection regime the traits showed reversion of the trend but not to the basal level. Responses exhibited by the selected flies from Port Blair and Mysuru differed, with the former group exhibiting more reduction in body length, more reduction in water content, greater antioxidant enzyme activity, longer post-infection period, greater survival than the later group. On the other side, Mysuru flies showed greater fat deposition, faster developmental time and longer oviposition time than Port Blair flies. Interestingly, Port Blair flies exhibited an increase in post-ovipository period, in contrast to Mysuru flies that showed a decrease for the same. We inferred that two allopatric populations of D. ananassae from the Indian sub-continent show different trade-off between evolving immune response and life history traits. Further, the outcome of our study leads us to a point of realization how allopatric populations of a given species respond differently under given selection pressure and gradually diverge from each other in nature to develop a species barrier.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, we describe and compare the diet of two populations of Pleurodema diplolister from northeastern Brazil. We assessed whether diet composition varies between the different populations and whether the size of individuals is related to the composition, volume and the size of prey consumed. Stomach contents were retrieved through the stomach-flushing technique from specimens collected in two municipalities (Morro do Chapéu and Rio de Contas) in the semi-arid region of Bahia State. We captured a total of 163 individuals and 91 of them had some type of stomach contents. A total of 278 food items were classified and distributed among 10 prey categories. The main food items consumed include Hymenoptera (Formicidae), Isoptera and Coleoptera. The morphometric measurements (snout-vent length and mouth width) of P. diplolister were significantly correlated with the diet (total volume of prey and length of the largest prey ingested). Diet composition differed between the two localities, showing little overlap between populations. Part of the variation in diet composition may be attributed to differences in the size of P. diplolister individuals. However, many factors can be associated to these differences, such as prey availability, landscape structure or even anthropic influences on the local ecosystem. In order to unravel the intricacies behind these distinct patterns, a comprehensive examination of these factors and others becomes imperative. This detailed analysis is crucial for a more thorough understanding of the extent to which these elements influence the feeding habits of anurans.},

For debates among experts, in particular, it might be hard to discern (less) reliable information, as all actors by definition are qualified. In these cases, the use of trustworthiness metrics on sources is a useful proxy for establishing the truthfulness of contents. We introduce an algorithmic model for automatically generating a dynamic trustworthiness hierarchy among information sources based on several parameters, including fact-checking. The method is novel and significant, especially in two respects: first, the generated hierarchy represents a helpful tool for laypeople to navigate experts’ debates; second, it also allows to identify and overcome biases generated by intuitive rankings held by agents at the beginning of the debates. We provide an experimental analysis of our algorithmic model applied to the debate on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which took place among Italian medical specialists between 2020 and 2021.},

The process is highly non-linear and involves many parameters, leading to large computation times to fully simulate the process or train a regression model on the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, dimension-reduced neural networks (DR-NNs) for efficient springback prediction in the process of deep drawing a cylindrical cup are presented with consideration for different materials. The DR-NNs are trained on FEM data from a deep drawing simulation performed on ABAQUS/CAE. Features such as the workpiece’s initial coordinates, material properties, and thickness are introduced as inputs for the dimensionality reduction. Linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods reduce the input to a smaller set of principal components, which are fed as inputs to the neural networks for predicting the springback after punch release. The DR-NNs are compared against a deep neural network (DNN) and show improvements in lower computation time for training, prediction uncertainty, and less storage space required while retaining prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Computational data of a complex problem could be mapped and solved by artificial intelligence (AI) for postprocessing purposes and numerical time-saving. A fuzzy adaptive network as a hybrid AI system has already been used for CFD data machine learning. However, no investigation has been done for the ant colony optimisation (ACO) performance evaluation compared to the adaptive network. As a state-of-the-art method, the ACO and fuzzy system are combined and tuned to estimate the flow in a reactor. The liquid-phase velocity in the y-direction is predicted using a combination of fuzzy system and ACO in a large domain. The findings further indicate that, in addition to the CFD dataset and Navier-Stokes’s equations, employing an ant colony optimisation structure as a training technique may give an accurate approximation of two-phase flow. Furthermore, for numerical methods, a continuous link between input and output datasets may be a significant data source for the AI mechanism to train the physical process, incredibly bubbly flow. The ant colony optimisation shows a more accurate prediction than the adaptive network. As far as authors know, there are no such investigations to develop a new AI algorithm and performance analysis for fluid dynamics problems.},

The main objective of a hybrid recurrent neural network with chaos game optimisation (RNN-CGO) is to achieve the recognition of alphabet signs from 2D gesture images. The different stages included in this technique are pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. The proposed approach is executed using American Sign Language (ASL) dataset with the help of the PYTHON platform. The precision, accuracy, f1-score, and recall obtained for the proposed approach are 99.28%, 99.96%, 99.25%, and 99.28%, respectively. The inference time required for the proposed approach is 0.121 s. The proposed technique has less computational complexity.

Although moving data to a server is a useful solution for storage, the owner of the data loses control, which results in security lapses. An efficient method for cloud-based data models is data integrity. In order to protect data privacy in IoT healthcare, this paper develops a data integrity technique. The Data Owner, IoT server, Key Generator Center, and Auditor are the four entities that make up this model. Here, the ability to verify the accuracy of the outsourced data is present in the auditor, data owner, and IoT server. The setup, storage, and verification phase are the three stages that make up the data integrity model. Here, the proposed Taylor-based Border Collie Cat optimisation is used to generate integrity keys in the best possible way. Here, the Taylor series and Border Collie Cat optimisation (BCCO) are combined to derive the proposed Taylor-based BCCO. Python is used to carry out the proposed strategy’s implementation.

The high flexibility and diversity of current industrial production processes make monitoring technology for small batch processes even more important. In multivariate process monitoring, a broader applicability exists in multivariate coefficients of variation (MCV) based monitoring schemes due to the lower restriction of the process. In view of the effectiveness of MCV monitoring and with the aim to achieve further performance improvement of current MCV monitoring schemes in a finite horizon production, we additionally introduce two one-sided cumulative sum (CUSUM) MCV schemes. In the case of deterministic and random shifts, the design parameters of the proposed schemes are obtained via an optimization procedure designed by the Markov chain method and the corresponding performance is analysed based on different run length (RL) characteristics, including the mean and the standard deviation. Simulation comparisons with existing exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) MCV schemes show that the proposed CUSUM MCV schemes are more efficient in monitoring most of the shifts, including the deterministic and random shifts. Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of the new monitoring schemes, a comprehensive case study on monitoring a steel sleeve manufacturing process is conducted.},

The existence and uniqueness results for maximum likelihood estimators of unknown parameters are established, whereas approximate confidence intervals are constructed using the observed Fisher information matrix. In addition, Bayes estimates are explored based on a flexible Gamma-Dirichlet prior information. Furthermore, when there is a priori order information on competing risk parameters being available, traditional classical likelihood and Bayesian estimates are also established under restricted parameter case. The behavior of the proposed estimators is evaluated through extensive simulation studies, and a real data study is presented for illustrative purposes.},

To address this issue, we introduce the TCN-LSTM-SNN (TLSNN) model, a hybrid framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for robust feature extraction, within a highly efficient Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture. Additionally, we employ the Subtraction-Average-Based Optimizer (SABO) to refine the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique, thereby separating the periodic and trend components of stock indices, reducing noise interference, and establishing a decomposition ensemble framework to bolster the model&#39;s resilience. The experimental results show that the VMD-TLSNN hybrid model suggested in this study surpasses other individual benchmark models and their hybrid models in prediction accuracy.

  abstract     = {There are many studies aimed at promoting positive lifestyle behaviors to reduce lifetime risk of cancer and related diseases. However, assessing these modifiable behaviors through statistical modeling is challenging because of the multidimensionality of interrelated measurements that may dramatically differ between at-risk individuals. Taking into account this heterogeneity while considering the multidimensionality of behavior changes is fundamental to tailoring interventions to their needs. Biomarkers that identify high-risk individuals may help validate proximal measures, but the number of validated methods that link biomarkers to multiple behavioral measurements by determining their dynamic relations with disease risks is limited to just a few, since it requires an advanced statistical methodology to address challenges in analyzing biomarker data, including left-censoring due to limits of detection. To address these challenges, we propose a method that constructs a quantile-specific weighted index of multiple behavioral measurements. Under the quantile regression framework, the proposed method renders a multidimensional view of risk-specific behavioral patterns by connecting them with biomarker levels to provide better insights into heterogeneous behavioral profiles among at-risk populations. We evaluate performances of the proposed method through simulations, and illustrate its applications to the Tu Salud ¡Sí Cuenta! data by examining behavior changes among Mexican-American adults.},

These conditions are applied when the constraints of the problem do not necessarily satisfy any regularity assumptions and they are based on the concept of p -regularity, introduced by Tret&#39;yakov (1983, Necessary conditions for optimality of p th order. Control Optim.;28–35). We introduce the notion of generalized Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification. This new concept is used to obtain our results.},

  abstract     = {A differential equation incorporating random matrices, multiple Liu processes, and multiple V jump processes is employed to portray a multifactor uncertain random system with jump. The existence and uniqueness theorem for such an equation is proved. Based on the theorem, problems of optimal control and two-person zero-sum game subject to multifactor uncertain random systems with jump are considered. An equation of optimality is provided for solving a problem of optimal control. Equilibrium equations are proposed to identify the saddle-point of a two-person zero-sum game problem. As an extension, we generalize the obtained results to the problems subject to differential equations including random matrices, multiple Liu processes, and multiple V - n jumps processes. Finally, a portfolio selection game problem is analysed utilizing the acquired theoretical results.},

In this paper, we extend this technique to problems involving inequality constraints. In particular, we analyze two approaches. One tackles directly the inequality-constrained problem at hand, while the second approach employs squared slacks for reformulating the inequality constraints as equalities. Some theoretical justifications for the corresponding two variants of the stabilized sequential programming algorithm equipped with dual modification procedures are provided. Theoretical expectations are supported by promising numerical results.},

  abstract     = {With the development of social economy and the improvement of people living standards, the distribution of cold chain products has become increasingly prominent. In the process of distribution of cold chain products, due to its perishable nature, it is not only necessary to consider the efficiency and economy of transportation, but also to pay attention to risk aversion factors. Therefore, the stochastic programming of cold chain logistics based on risk aversion has become an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming to minimize the economic cost and transform the carbon emission level of cold chain transportation into carbon emission cost, a distributionally robust mean-conditional value-at-risk optimization model for the perishable goods distribution management problem is established, in which the partial distribution information of uncertain demand and transportation environment temperature was known. Then a computationally tractable equivalence model is obtained under the box ambiguity set. For the proposed nonlinear model, a trust region sequential quadratic programming method with filter is proposed to solve it. Finally, through a case study, the relationship between the stochastic programming model and the distributionally robust model is analysed.},
