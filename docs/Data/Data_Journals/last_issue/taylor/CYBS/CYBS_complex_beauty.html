  abstract     = {Nowadays, the prediction of student performance is still complicated to analyze the talent of individuals and the effort to improve their academic performance. Moreover, the researchers are performed to analyze the outcomes of student performance but the educational database consists of a huge data volume, which is hard to train the small sample. In this research work, a new hybrid deep learning model with optimized entropy rough set theory is developed to predict the student’s performance accurately. The preprocessing phase is performed with outlier removal and the data-filling method. The features are mined from the preprocessed data by Entropy weighted Rough set-based feature mining. A novel meta-heuristic hybrid Galactic Rider Swarm Optimization (GRSO) algorithm is developed for feature mining. A hybrid deep learning-based Convolutional Recurrent Network (CRN) is implemented for prediction, where the classification performance is improved by the GRSO algorithm. Here, the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are optimized by the GRSO algorithm. Here, the sensitivity and accuracy rate of the recommended GRSO-CRN method attain 94% and 93%. The simulation outcome of the proposed GRSO-CRN model achieves enriched performance.},

  abstract     = {Association Rule Mining is used for data mining using the associate rules for detecting frequent items. Hence, this research introduces a novel sequential rule mining for predicting user category using the proposed hybrid Tasmanian Water Devil Optimization based map reduce framework. The introduced Tasmanian Water Devil Optimization integrates the feeding behavior of the Tasmanian devil in the Tasmanian devil optimization with the water cycle process of streams and rivers flowing toward the sea in the water cycle algorithm for choosing the optimal rule from the rule set. In this, the big data based on the retail transaction is utilized for identifying the frequent items using the proposed Tasmanian Water Devil Optimization Sequential Associate Mining technique at the Mapper side. Then, the integration of rules is employed at the Reducer side for the prediction of user category using the Deep Convolutional Neural Network. Thus, the proposed Tasmanian Water Devil Optimization Sequential Associate Mining + Deep Convolutional Neural Network outperformed other conventional methods, obtained enhanced performance in terms of rules mined, execution time, recall, and precision, and obtained the values of 183, 7.70, 0.88, and 0.88, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few years, many researchers apply SWOT analysis in combination with other methodologies in order to obtain enhanced strategic planning frameworks and tackle the weaknesses of applying only one approach. To overcome some shortcomings of SWOT analysis, an integrated SWOT analysis, fuzzy net present value (FNPV), and fuzzy Shapley value (FSV) methodology was proposed in the present study as a conceptual framework to cost-effectively achieve and manage the objectives for efficiency, capacity, and availability as well as to provide practical insights on how to formulate strategic decisions. The fuzzy net present value method was used to determine the strategic importance of the SWOT matrix. Taking into account the theoretical foundation of the cooperative games, the fuzzy Shapley value was used to determine the optimal combination of SWOT matrix strategies to effectively overcome the ambiguities and uncertainty of real-world conditions. In the game, any type of strategy (WT, WO, ST, and SO) was considered as a player who had partial freedom to make some choices. According to the results of the present study, the combination of the WT 1 WO 1 ST 2 SO 2 strategy was selected as the most appropriate strategy combination to be implemented in the organization.},

  abstract     = {Currently, for high-performance appliances the easiness of installation, weight, size, and cost are major constraints. Spacecraft, aircraft, missile, and satellite appliances require lower profile antennas, and U-slot MPA can be well fitted for such appliances because of its wide-band nature. MPA integrating U-shape slots are renowned for including comparatively larger bandwidth impedance (around 30%). This article aims to develop an optimized U-slot MPA design, where the antenna measurements such as patch height or board thickness, patch length, patch width, and feed diameter are optimally tuned by a new hybrid optimization model. As the concepts of Dingo Optimization and Black Widow Optimization are combined, the adopted algorithm is called Black Widow in Dingo Model with Logistic Chaotic Map. The priority of the introduced scheme is examined via the assessment over existing models by varying the frequency ranges, and cost analysis is also done for varied iterations.},

  abstract     = {Watermarking is a technique for protecting multimedia data, mainly images, from malicious attacks by adding a signature into these images. Traditional watermarking techniques, unfortunately, have drawbacks when used on sensitive images like those used in medicine. A reliable and blind watermarking method is suggested in this work to protect medical picture transferred in telemedicine. Medical picture marking enables accurate patient identification, prevents scan confusion, and minimizes the risk of diagnostic mistakes that could have negative consequences. In this method, three distinct transforms are used to acquire the frequency content of the image. The low frequency subbands are subsequently subjected to Schur decomposition. In order to incorporate the watermark bits, the resultant upper triangular matrix values are modified. The proposed approaches effectively retain a considerable quality of watermarked images and are impressively resistant against numerous conventional attacks, according to imperceptibility and robustness experimental results. The average Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which was obtained was 44.90 dB, demonstrating that the integration procedure produces very low distortion to the original image. The observed results for robustness demonstrate that the watermark is resilient to the most of the attacks performed in watermarking, with a normalized cross correlation rate higher than 0.9.},
