  abstract     = {This article presents a distributed predefined-time neural adaptive control scheme for the consensus of networked Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems under model uncertainties and external perturbations through directed communication topology. First, a distributed predefined-time observer is constructed to estimate the leader&#39;s state information for each follower agent. Then, based on the recovered information, the predefined-time local controller is designed for each follower agent by utilising the predefined-time backstepping control approach. Moreover, the neural network (NN) is incorporated to identify the lumped unknown item. Particularly, an indirect learning mechanism is adopted to determine the upper bound of the optimal NN weight. In this way, the computational cost of the presented controller is greatly degraded. Stability evaluation shows that the presented controller can guarantee the position and velocity synchronisation errors regulate to the minor regions around zero in predefined time. Lastly, simulated studies are conducted on the consensus of networked robotic manipulators to validate the obtained results.},

By a tag update, an attack detection mechanism is proposed to estimate whether malicious attacks happen or not. It can do its utmost to identify all connections and generate a new spanning tree to reduce the adverse impact if attacks occur. Both dynamic communication ETM and dynamic controller ETM are designed with adjusting parameters to further decrease the resource usage.

To start, the integration of a compensation controller within the control architecture is examined, aiming to formulate the projection error dynamics. By leveraging projection error system analysis alongside output observation and sliding mode control, a meticulously crafted derivative-based sliding mode surface along with a sliding mode controller are devised, ensuring both convergence and seamless sliding motion. Afterwards, the accessibility of the surface is assessed through relevant lemmas, Caputo derivative characteristics and the Lyapunov direct approach. The subsequent stability of sliding path is corroborated, and indispensable prerequisites for achieving finite-time projective synchronisation are outlined. Furthermore, the establishment of an upper bound for synchronisation time of distinct Caputo fractional-order delayed neural networks (CFDNNs) with inconsistent orders is carried out. Ultimately, simulations on distinct CFDNNs with consistent and inconsistent orders are conducted to exemplify our approach, employing the continuous frequency distribution model.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the tracking control problem of nonlinear time delay systems. For time delay systems, we consider nonaffine pure-feedback structure. Additionally, the case where the time delay systems are subject to input saturation and unknown states is also taken into account. To begin with, a mean value theorem and an implicit function theorem are exploited to transform the systems into an affine form. Afterwards, a state observer is developed to estimate the unknown state variables and an extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to approximate the unknown functions. The output of the command filter replaces the virtual control signal&#39;derivative, thereby circumventing the problem of ‘explosion of complexity’. Meanwhile, compensation signals are introduced to eliminate the filtering errors in a dynamic surface control (DSC). A Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is designed to mitigate the unknown constant state time delay. During the controller design process, combining a prescribed performance control (PPC) with a command filter control, the tracking error can converge to a predetermined bound. Additionally, the effect of input saturation is eliminated with the aid of an auxiliary system. Finally, the effectiveness of such controller is further proved by taking an electromechanical system as an application object.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to the design of a discrete-time Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control (FSMC) system for Single Input Single Output (SISO) applications, utilising the Autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) method for system modelling. The proposed methodology emphasises the Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) to ensure minimal tracking errors through a transformation of tracking errors based on a specified performance function. A Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (FQSMC) is subsequently developed to maintain the tracking error within predetermined bounds, effectively addressing the chattering phenomenon commonly associated with the traditional sliding mode control. The integration of fractional calculus enhances the smoothness of the output while ensuring accurate tracking, making it ideal for real-world applications. Additionally, a novel Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) observer is introduced to bolster the system&#39;s resilience against uncertainties and disturbances without complicating the computational process. The effectiveness of the proposed Prescribed Performance Fractional-Order Quasi-Sliding Mode Control (PP-FQSMC) is validated through extensive MATLAB simulations and experimental studies conducted on a Tank system. Results demonstrate that the PP-FQSMC significantly outperforms traditional methods, with maximum tracking errors of 1.6 × 10 −4 compared to 0.2 for the PP-QSMC and a Root Mean Square Tracking Error (RMSTE) of 1.3 × 10 −3 compared to 1.2 × 10 −4 for the PP-QSMC, ensuring strong tracking performance and stability. The findings indicate that the proposed controller effectively mitigates chattering in control signals while maintaining a smooth output. It showcases its potential for practical applications in environments characterised by model inaccuracies, time delays, and external disturbances.},

This sliding mode function contains two equilibrium points. When the states of the closed-loop system are on the sliding mode surface, they converge to the equilibrium point near the initial states. Based on this sliding mode function, an adaptive attitude stabilising control law with tuning parameters is designed to compensate the external disturbances and inertia uncertainty. The presented control law guarantees that the settling time of the closed-loop system and the bounds of the system states can be explicitly determined in advance by adjusting parameters of the sliding mode function and the control law. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented control law. The simulation results illustrate that the predefined-time convergence and unwinding-free property of the closed-loop system are guaranteed by adopting the presented control law.},

Specially, the proposed STD-ETESO incorporates a finite-time switching strategy, which improves the poor transient performance of the STD acting as a pre-filter to prepare relatively smooth signals for the ESO. The locally asymptotic boundedness of the estimation error can be guaranteed by the Input-state-stability (ISS) and existing research for the STD. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by a general example and a practical motion control system. Different integral criteria is introduced to evaluate the overall tracking accuracy and energy usage for comparison with existing different ESOs, which reveals the superiority of the proposed STD-ETESO in noise attenuation and disturbance rejection.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the event-driven intelligent fault-tolerant containment control problem for nonlinear multiagent systems affected by unknown disturbances, and conducts a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic stability of the system. Reduced-order modelling is employed for system modelling and identification, while radial basis function neural networks are utilised to estimate the nonlinear functions of the system model. An event-driven control scheme is designed based on the backstepping method and Lyapunov functional approach. In contrast to existing consensus control schemes, the proposed event-driven control schemes are specifically tailored to improve the energy efficiency and endurance of nonlinear multiagent systems operating in complex environments. Under the proposed control law, the output of each follower is converge to the convex hull spanned by the outputs of the leaders. The effectiveness of the proposed method is rigorously validated through numerical simulations. Furthermore, a practical example involving the design of a marine surface vehicle using advanced robotics technology is presented to further substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.},
