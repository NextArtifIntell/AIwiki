The article presents a new adaptive control for parallel kinematic manipulators (PKMs) based on the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) technique and validates its ineffectiveness by real-time experiments.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new practical stabilization method for discrete-time switched nonlinear systems without a common equilibrium point among all modes. The proposed method has two main features. First, the number of nonlinear terms in the stability conditions is independent of the number of switched system modes. The result is that the computational cost is reduced, and it can be applied to switched systems with a large number of subsystems. Second, using switched Lyapunov functions, hybrid switching laws are designed to preserve the practical stability property in both the closed-loop state-dependent switching function and the open-loop time-dependent one. As a result, when the state data is lost during sensor or communication failures, the controller can change the control scheme from a closed-loop state-dependent switching function to an open-loop time-dependent one without loss of stability property. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.},

Since the dead-zone phenomenon is frequently encountered in the control of nonlinear strict feedback system, it is very necessary to consider the effect of dead-zone in the OB control. However, the published OB control methods are to rarely deal with the dead-zone problem because of the complex algorithm of reinforcement learning (RL). In this OB control, the dead-zone problem is effectively solved by utilising a simplified RL algorithm. For effective eliminating the effect of dead-zone, an adaptive compensation of dead-zone function&#39;s remainder is added to this RL. Since the RL under identifier-critic-actor architecture is implemented in every backstepping step, the requirement of complete dynamic acknowledge is released. Ultimately, the validity of this OB method is certified both theory and simulation.},

The proposed controller consists of two linear and nonlinear parts, without any switching elements. The linear part is designed to solve the main regulation problem, while the nonlinear part is designed to enhance the performance of the closed-loop system in the face of input saturation. The delay-range dependent stability conditions of the closed-loop system are analysed using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) approach, which involves solving an LMI problem to determine the parameters of the proposed controller. Furthermore, the admissibility of the closed-loop system is assessed to ensure the system’s stability, regularity, and causality. Finally, the theoretical achievements are endorsed by simulations through numerical and practical examples.},

Specifically, we add a kind of nonnegative impulses which is consistent with the switching behaviours for the systems. We first study switched homogeneous positive nonlinear systems (SHPNS) case, then we extend the SHPNS to a time-varying SHNS case. The primary difficulty of this research is the estimation of Lyapunov function value at switching-impulse points under the coupling effects of synchronous switches and state jumps. By employing the max-separable Lyapunov function approach, we present new sufficient stability criteria and design new switching-impulse signals, and successfully establish the new relation between the average dwell time parameter and impulse strength. Then, we apply the obtained results to the time-varying vehicle formation model with impulses. At last, four examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility of our results, which includes the specific algorithm verification process.},

This approach adopts a reference trajectory strategy. By utilising the designed exponential reaching law, it is demonstrated that, compared with traditional methods, both the sliding mode variable and the steps required to enter the quasi-sliding mode domain can be adaptively adjusted based on the system&#39;s state and parameters. Subsequently, a disturbance-dependent reaching law, built upon the exponential model, is developed to ensure the Lyapunov stability of the system and to attenuate its ultimate bandwidth. Furthermore, an analysis is conducted on the stability condition between the exponential and disturbance-dependent reaching laws, illustrating that the designed referred sliding phase optimises the ultimate bandwidth. This methodology is then applied to multi-agent systems to validate its effectiveness, where quasi-leader-following consensus and error boundedness are explored. Finally, the results are corroborated through numerical simulations, considering both a general discrete-time system and a multi-agent systems.},

A novel disturbance observer-based control (DOBC) scheme is proposed through combining radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and prescribed performance function (PPF). In contrast to traditional DOBC, the proposed approach employs RBFNN technology to approximate unknown nonlinear functions in the system, instead of treating them as part of lumped disturbances. A novel disturbance observer is developed to estimate disturbances characterised by a nonlinear exogenous system. To enhance control performance, a PPF that characterises both transient and steady-state behaviour is used for the transformation of tracking errors. It can be proved that all the states of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), and that the tracking error evolves within the prespecified boundaries. Theoretical results are validated and supported by two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {We propose an adaptive algorithm for identifying the unknown parameter (possibly vector-valued) in a linear stable single-input single-output infinite-dimensional system. We assume that the transfer function of the infinite-dimensional system can be expressed as a ratio of two infinite series in s (the Laplace variable). We also assume that certain identifiability conditions, which include a persistency of excitation condition, hold. For a fixed integer n , we propose an adaptive update law (a differential equation in time) driven by real-time input-output data for estimating the first n + 1 coefficients in the numerator and the denominator of the transfer function. We show that the estimates for the transfer function coefficients generated by the update law are close to the true values at large times provided n is sufficiently large (the estimates converge to the true values as time and n tend to infinity). The unknown parameter can be reconstructed using the transfer function coefficient estimates obtained with n large and the algebraic expressions relating the transfer function coefficients to the unknown parameter. We also provide a numerical scheme for verifying the identifiability conditions and for choosing n sufficiently large so that the value of the reconstructed parameter is close to the true value. The class of systems to which our approach is applicable includes many partial differential equations with constant/spatially-varying coefficients and distributed/boundary input and output. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach using three examples: a delay system with four unknown scalars, a 1D heat equation with two unknown scalars and a 1D wave equation with an unknown linearly-varying (in space) coefficient.},

  abstract     = {The stability of stochastic nonlinear systems with time-delay and state-dependent switching is studied in this paper. Firstly, system maximal solution is constructed and further extended as the global solution under certain mild conditions. Secondly, several Krasovskii-type stability and Razumikhin-type theorems are proposed by uniformly asymptotically stable functions (UASFs). These stability criteria overcome some stringent constraints associated with Lyapunov functional/functions. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated through two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the non-singular control for strict-feedback nonlinear time-delay systems. The boundedness of all the signals of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved by introducing a class of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, including exponential functions. Besides, novel auxiliary functions with continuous derivatives are proposed to construct the control law to avoid the discontinuity of the virtual controllers. Besides, the amount of computation is reduced by applying the new auxiliary functions when the other control methods require loads of calculations for handling singular problems. In the end, numerical examples are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with various duality results for a new class of constrained robust nonlinear control problems. Concretely, we introduce a minimisation problem associated with a vector of functionals of multiple integral type. In addition, the considered multi-objective controlled optimisation problem is governed by several mixed constraints generated by partial derivatives of second order and uncertain data. For this new class of control problems, we establish and characterise Wolfe, Mond-Weir and mixed type robust dual models. To this aim, by using the notion of convex multiple integral functional , generated by a controlled second-order Lagrangian with uncertain data, and the concept of robust weak efficient solution to the problem under study, we build a new mathematical context to state and prove the duality theorems.},

  abstract     = {The control of relaxation-type systems of ordinary differential equations is investigated using the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Firstly, we recast the model as a singularly perturbed dynamics which we embed in a family of controlled systems. Then we study this dynamics together with the value function of the associated optimal control problem. We provide an asymptotic expansion in the relaxation parameter of the value function. We also show that its solution converges toward the solution of a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for a reduced control problem. Such systems are motivated by semi-discretisation of kinetic and hyperbolic partial differential equations. Several examples are presented including Jin–Xin relaxation.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the finite-time trajectory tracking control of a class of Euler–Lagrange (EL) systems under unknown velocity information, dynamic uncertainties and disturbances. An extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is employed to approximate the uncertainties, while an adaptive algorithm is proposed to tune output weights of the ELM, as well as to eliminate the negative effects of residual errors and disturbances. Then an adaptive finite-time ELM-based velocity observer is developed to estimate the unavailable velocity states. Further, based on the estimations and the approximations of model uncertainties, an adaptive finite-time observer-based nonsingular terminal sliding mode (TSM) control strategy is constructed to guarantee the finite-time bounded tracking of the uncertain EL system by using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation results on a robotic manipulator platform demonstrate the efficiency of the developed finite-time observation and control methods.},

  abstract     = {We present an interpretation of switching signals with certain average dwell time in terms of Poisson process, which allows to build a probabilistic framework to accommodate all the switching signals of this kind. As a result, we can learn more knowledge about such signals. In particular, such a switching signal and the solution of the corresponding switching system jointly constitute a Markov process. And the Markov property will facilitate the asymptotic behaviour analysis of the switching dynamics. As a byproduct, we present an upper bound on the joint spectral radius of a family of Hurwitz or anti-Hurwitz matrices, which turns out to be quite sharp as compared with the existing results.},
