  abstract     = {Current monitoring technologies emphasize and address the issue of monitoring high-volume production processes. The high flexibility and diversity of current industrial production processes make monitoring technology for small batch processes even more important. In multivariate process monitoring, a broader applicability exists in multivariate coefficients of variation (MCV) based monitoring schemes due to the lower restriction of the process. In view of the effectiveness of MCV monitoring and with the aim to achieve further performance improvement of current MCV monitoring schemes in a finite horizon production, we additionally introduce two one-sided cumulative sum (CUSUM) MCV schemes. In the case of deterministic and random shifts, the design parameters of the proposed schemes are obtained via an optimization procedure designed by the Markov chain method and the corresponding performance is analysed based on different run length (RL) characteristics, including the mean and the standard deviation. Simulation comparisons with existing exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) MCV schemes show that the proposed CUSUM MCV schemes are more efficient in monitoring most of the shifts, including the deterministic and random shifts. Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of the new monitoring schemes, a comprehensive case study on monitoring a steel sleeve manufacturing process is conducted.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores inferences for a competing risk model with dependent causes of failure. When the lifetimes of competing risks are modelled by a Marshall–Olikin bivariate Kies distribution, classical and Bayesian estimations are studied under generalized progressive hybrid censoring. The existence and uniqueness results for maximum likelihood estimators of unknown parameters are established, whereas approximate confidence intervals are constructed using the observed Fisher information matrix. In addition, Bayes estimates are explored based on a flexible Gamma-Dirichlet prior information. Furthermore, when there is a priori order information on competing risk parameters being available, traditional classical likelihood and Bayesian estimates are also established under restricted parameter case. The behavior of the proposed estimators is evaluated through extensive simulation studies, and a real data study is presented for illustrative purposes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, Bayesian estimates are derived for the location and scale parameters of the Laplace distribution based on complete, Type-I, and Type-II censored samples under different prior settings. Subsequently, Bayesian point and interval estimates, as well as the associated statistical inference, are discussed in detail. The developed methods are then applied to two real data sets for illustrative purposes. Moreover, a detailed Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out for evaluating the performance of the inferential methods developed here. Finally, we provide a brief discussion of the established results to demonstrate their practical utility and present some associated problems of further interest. Overall, this study fills an existing gap in the development of Bayesian inferential techniques for the parameters of the two-parameter Laplace distribution, making this research innovative and offering more investigative implications. It showcases the potential for broader methodological applications of Bayesian inference for complex real-world data sets, especially in scenarios involving different forms of censoring. This research provides a critical tool for statistical analysis in different fields such as engineering and finance, where the Laplace distribution is frequently adopted as a fundamental model.},

We support our findings with a simulation study that models a real survey dataset. We suggest that a careful choice of such weights can also lead to all estimates of proportion lying between [0, 1].

  abstract     = {The stock market index typically mirrors the financial market&#39;s performance. Hence, accurate prediction of stock market index trends is essential for investors aiming to mitigate financial risk and enhance future investment returns. Traditional statistical approaches often struggle with the non-linear nature of stock market index data, leading to potential inaccuracies in long-term predictions. To address this issue, we introduce the TCN-LSTM-SNN (TLSNN) model, a hybrid framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for robust feature extraction, within a highly efficient Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture. Additionally, we employ the Subtraction-Average-Based Optimizer (SABO) to refine the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique, thereby separating the periodic and trend components of stock indices, reducing noise interference, and establishing a decomposition ensemble framework to bolster the model&#39;s resilience. The experimental results show that the VMD-TLSNN hybrid model suggested in this study surpasses other individual benchmark models and their hybrid models in prediction accuracy. Additionally, it demonstrates notably lower energy consumption compared to other hybrid models.},

Consequently, we approximate the infinite-dimensional function-on-function linear quantile regression model using a multivariate quantile regression model constructed from these partial quantile regression components. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed techniques, we conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments and analyze an empirical dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods in finite-sample scenarios.

  abstract     = {There are many studies aimed at promoting positive lifestyle behaviors to reduce lifetime risk of cancer and related diseases. However, assessing these modifiable behaviors through statistical modeling is challenging because of the multidimensionality of interrelated measurements that may dramatically differ between at-risk individuals. Taking into account this heterogeneity while considering the multidimensionality of behavior changes is fundamental to tailoring interventions to their needs. Biomarkers that identify high-risk individuals may help validate proximal measures, but the number of validated methods that link biomarkers to multiple behavioral measurements by determining their dynamic relations with disease risks is limited to just a few, since it requires an advanced statistical methodology to address challenges in analyzing biomarker data, including left-censoring due to limits of detection. To address these challenges, we propose a method that constructs a quantile-specific weighted index of multiple behavioral measurements. Under the quantile regression framework, the proposed method renders a multidimensional view of risk-specific behavioral patterns by connecting them with biomarker levels to provide better insights into heterogeneous behavioral profiles among at-risk populations. We evaluate performances of the proposed method through simulations, and illustrate its applications to the Tu Salud ¡Sí Cuenta! data by examining behavior changes among Mexican-American adults.},
