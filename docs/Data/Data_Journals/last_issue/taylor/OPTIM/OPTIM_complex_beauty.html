The existence and uniqueness theorem for such an equation is proved. Based on the theorem, problems of optimal control and two-person zero-sum game subject to multifactor uncertain random systems with jump are considered. An equation of optimality is provided for solving a problem of optimal control. Equilibrium equations are proposed to identify the saddle-point of a two-person zero-sum game problem. As an extension, we generalize the obtained results to the problems subject to differential equations including random matrices, multiple Liu processes, and multiple V - n jumps processes. Finally, a portfolio selection game problem is analysed utilizing the acquired theoretical results.},

In this paper, we extend this technique to problems involving inequality constraints. In particular, we analyze two approaches. One tackles directly the inequality-constrained problem at hand, while the second approach employs squared slacks for reformulating the inequality constraints as equalities. Some theoretical justifications for the corresponding two variants of the stabilized sequential programming algorithm equipped with dual modification procedures are provided. Theoretical expectations are supported by promising numerical results.},

  abstract     = {With the development of social economy and the improvement of people living standards, the distribution of cold chain products has become increasingly prominent. In the process of distribution of cold chain products, due to its perishable nature, it is not only necessary to consider the efficiency and economy of transportation, but also to pay attention to risk aversion factors. Therefore, the stochastic programming of cold chain logistics based on risk aversion has become an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming to minimize the economic cost and transform the carbon emission level of cold chain transportation into carbon emission cost, a distributionally robust mean-conditional value-at-risk optimization model for the perishable goods distribution management problem is established, in which the partial distribution information of uncertain demand and transportation environment temperature was known. Then a computationally tractable equivalence model is obtained under the box ambiguity set. For the proposed nonlinear model, a trust region sequential quadratic programming method with filter is proposed to solve it. Finally, through a case study, the relationship between the stochastic programming model and the distributionally robust model is analysed.},
