  abstract     = {The computational prediction of herbal ingredient-target interactions (ITIs) is essential for understanding the mechanisms of action (MoA) of herbal medicine. However, many existing computational methods have yet to fully utilize the multi-modal knowledge of herbs, and the potential noise in literature-mined ITI data has been overlooked. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-ITI, a multi-modal learning framework to learn molecular biological and network topological features for ingredients and targets from multi-modal herbal data, including ingredient SMILES sequences, target protein sequences, ingredient SMILES sequence similarity, target protein sequence similarity, and ingredient-target interactions. Multi-ITI consists of a biological feature learning module and a heterogeneous graph learning module. The biological feature learning module integrates pre-trained models to build deep feature representations for ingredients and targets, while the heterogeneous graph learning module leverages a heterogeneous graph neural network with dynamic attention mechanisms to capture ingredient-target network interactions and mitigate the impact of noisy connections. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that Multi-ITI outperforms six state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of Multi-ITI through molecular docking simulations and comparisons with recent studies, further highlighting its superior predictive performance and practical applicability.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic Configuration Networks (SCNs) have exhibited significant potential in data mining, owing to their advantages in fast incremental construction and universal approximation capabilities. However, less researches were done on SCNs-based classification models for concept-drifting data streams. The so-called drifts refer to data distributions changing over time that may degrade the classification performance of SCNs trained on historical data. The previous drift adaptation approach is to discard all the hidden nodes of SCNs, and then learn a new model with new instances, in which the valuable historical information cannot be fully utilized. In addition, labeling all newly-arrived instances is time-consuming and impractical. To address these issues, an adaptive stochastic configuration network embedding online active learning is proposed. Crucially, a query strategy is developed to select representative instances for labeling based on the change degree of instances density and their uncertainty. An online update mechanism is employed to incrementally update the network&#39;s output parameters instance by instance. To rationally forget the outdated information and learn new concepts, a dynamic adjustment mechanism adaptively adds or prunes nodes in the SCN model. Experimental results for nine datasets confirm that our algorithm outperforms six popular ones on classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Multi-task learning (MTL) represents an advanced learning paradigm that improves the generalization ability and learning efficiency of a model by learning multiple related tasks simultaneously. The fundamental principle of multi-task learning is the transfer of information between tasks. Nevertheless where data is limited in quantity, effectively modeling inter-task correlations is a significant challenge. We propose a novel method, semi-supervised manifold regularized multi-task learning with privileged information (MSMTL-PI), that effectively leverages the intrinsic geometric structure of data by enforcing manifold regularization and subspace learning techniques. Specifically, a similarity graph is constructed over both labeled and unlabeled samples, ensuring the preservation of local geometric relationships between data points, and manifold regularization is applied as a constraint. Concurrently, information sharing on low-dimensional subspace makes the relationship modeling between tasks more reasonable. Furthermore, a significant amount of privileged information is incorporated into the training phase, thereby optimizing the decision boundary and reducing the impact of insufficient labeled samples on the model. There is substantial experimental evidence that MSMTL-PI markedly enhances the performance of image and text classification tasks, achieving superior classification accuracy with minimal labeled data. Across 15 benchmark datasets, MSMTL-PI consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving an average F1-scores improvement of 1.92% compared to the best baseline, with a maximum gain of 4.17%.},

  abstract     = {Collecting a sufficient amount of labeled data is challenging in practice. To deal with this challenge, active learning, which selects informative instances for annotation, has been studied. However, for time series, the dataset quality is often quite poor, and its multi-modality makes it unsuited to conventional active learning methods. Existing time series active learning methods have limitations, such as redundancy among selected instances, unrealistic assumptions on datasets, and inefficient calculations. We propose a batch active learning method for time series (BALT), which efficiently selects a batch of informative samples. BALT performs efficient clustering and picks one instance with the maximum informativeness score from each cluster. Using this score, we consider in-batch diversity explicitly so as to effectively handle multi-modality by exploring unknown regions, even under an extreme lack of labeled data. We also apply an adaptive weighting strategy to emphasize exploration in the early stage of the algorithm but shift to exploitation as the algorithm proceeds. Through experiments on several time-series datasets under various scenarios, we demonstrate the efficacy of BALT in achieving superior classification performance with less computation time under a predetermined budget, compared to existing time-series active learning methods.},

GAPDE enables continuous-time spatio-temporal modeling and dynamically prioritizes critical features through attention-driven traffic forecasting. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including PEMS-BAY, METR-LA, and various PeMS collections (PeMS03, PeMS04, PeMS07, PeMS08, PeMSD7M, and PeMSD7L), demonstrate GAPDE&#39;s superior performance over state-of-the-art models such as RGDAN, SGODE-RNN, and STD-MAE. GAPDE achieves up to 9.2 percent lower RMSE and 10.4 percent lower MAE, outperforming baselines in both short- and long-term prediction tasks. It demonstrates strong robustness to missing data, high scalability for large-scale networks, and enhanced interpretability through spatial and temporal attention visualizations. Comprehensive comparative evaluations and an in-depth ablation study further validate the effectiveness of GAPDE&#39;s components, including the GPDE block and spatio-temporal attention mechanisms. By combining PDEs, GCNs, and attention mechanisms in a scalable and efficient design, GAPDE offers a robust solution for real-time traffic forecasting in complex urban environments.},

First, we retrieve the infinite hierarchy of complexity classes of analog networks, defined in terms of the Kolmogorov complexity of their real weights. This hierarchy lies between the complexity classes P and P / poly . Next, using a natural identification between real numbers and infinite sequences of bits, we generalize this result to evolving networks, obtaining a similar hierarchy of complexity classes within the same bounds. Finally, we extend these results to stochastic networks that employ real probabilities as randomness, deriving a new infinite hierarchy of complexity classes situated between BPP and BPP / lo g ⁎ . Beyond providing examples of such hierarchies, we describe a generic method for constructing them based on classes of functions of increasing complexity. As a practical application, we show that the predictive capabilities of recurrent neural networks are strongly impacted by the quantization applied to their weights.

  abstract     = {Classification is one of the very important areas in data mining. In real-life problems, developed methods for modeling with the classification problem generally perform well on datasets where the class distribution is balanced. On the other hand, the data sets are often imbalanced and it is important to develop algorithms to solve the classification problem on imbalanced data sets. Imbalanced datasets are more difficult to classify than balanced datasets because learning a class with underrepresentation is difficult. Most real life problems are imbalanced. The class with the least number of data usually corresponds to rare cases and is more important. Learning these classes is critical accordingly. One of the most commonly used solution methods to solve this problem is to oversample the minor class. When oversampling, too many repetitions in the dataset can cause overfitting. For this reason, it is very important to ensure data diversity when oversampling. Therefore, this paper proposes a new oversampling methods (the incremental SMOTE) combining the incremental k-means algorithm and Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The original dataset is clustered with the incremental k-means algorithm and the clusters are filtered to determine the safe clusters. The number of points to be produced from the safe clusters is determined, and then new instances are produced with the improved SMOTE algorithm. In the incremental SMOTE, diversity in the dataset is achieved by generating with incremental rate. In order to evaluate the performance of the incremental SMOTE algorithm, classification was performed on imbalanced datasets, balanced datasets obtained by the random oversampling, SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE and SVM SMOTE methods. Comparisons for 10 datasets showed that the performance of the proposed method improves as the imbalance ratio of the dataset increases.},

This process involves using recommendation algorithms to predict and select optimal friendship connections, enhancing navigability and interaction efficiency within SIoT environments. The proposed model incorporates both the social relationships and resource-sharing dynamics of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to optimize recommendation accuracy and network performance. By combining Federated Learning (FL) principles with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), the MAFDRL framework allows multiple agents to collaboratively train models without compromising privacy, ensuring scalability across distributed networks. Additionally, the integration of cache-driven techniques enhances computational efficiency, reducing latency and cost in friendship path discovery and improving real-time decision-making. Our experiments, conducted with the Waze and MovieLens-1 M datasets, reveal that the introduced framework achieves an average 30 % reduction in system and delay expenses.
