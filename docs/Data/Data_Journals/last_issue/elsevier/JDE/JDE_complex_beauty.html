  abstract     = {This work is concerned with the minimum energy estimator for a nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation. The Mortensen observer – originally introduced for the energy-optimal reconstruction of the state of nonlinear finite-dimensional systems – is formulated for a disturbed cubic wave equation and the associated observer equation is derived. An in depth study of the associated optimal control problem and sensitivity analysis of the corresponding value function reveals that the energy optimal state estimator is well-defined. Deploying a classical fixed point argument we proceed to show that the observer equation is locally well-posed.},

We rigorously characterize the properties of the principal eigenvalue and establish a precise relationship between the coefficient functions and the dynamics. Our results indicate that slow predator movement and short frequency of environmental periodic variations promote successful predator invasion. Conversely, reducing the predator mortality rate facilitates long-term coexistence of both populations. Additionally, we explore the asymptotic behaviors of positive periodic solutions when the diffusion coefficients are large or small, revealing the effects of diffusion on the invasion dynamics.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on two-time-scale stochastic functional differential equations (SFDEs). It features in inclusion of infinite delay and coupling of slow and fast components. The coupling is through the segment processes of the slow and fast processes. The main difficulties include infinite delay and the coupling of segment processes involving fast and slow motions. Concentrating on weak convergence, the tightness of the segment process is established on a space of continuous functions. In addition, the Hölder continuity and boundedness for the segment process of the slow component, uniform boundedness for the segment process of a fixed- x SFDE, exponential ergodicity, and continuous dependence on parameters are obtained to carry out the desired asymptotic analysis, and also as byproducts, which are interesting in their own right. Then using the martingale problem formulation, an average principle is established by a direct averaging, which involves detailed computations and subtle estimates. Finally, two classes of special SFDEs, stochastic integro-differential equations and stochastic delay differential equations with two-time scales are investigated.},

In this paper, we give a definitive picture of the local controllability properties of this control problem for all critical lengths. In particular, we show that the unreachable space of the linearized system is always of dimension 1 and the KdV system with the right Dirichlet control is not locally null controllable in small time for any critical length. We also give a criterion to determine whether the system is locally exactly controllable in finite time or not locally null controllable in any positive time for all critical lengths. Consequently, we show that there exist critical lengths such that the system is not locally null controllable in small time but is locally exactly controllable in finite time.},

  abstract     = {A class of diffusive partial differential equations with strongly coupled time delays and diffusion is considered. The global boundedness of weak solutions of the equation is proved by an entropy method that was initially proposed for studying the global boundedness of reaction-diffusion equations with cross-diffusion. The presence of the time delays in the equation prevents the entropy method to be directly applied, and here we extend the entropy method to this class of diffusive partial differential equations with time delays by proving some key entropy inequalities, which further allows us to obtain the estimates of gradient of the solutions. The results can be used to show the global boundedness of solutions of population models with memory effect, which were recently proposed for describing the movement of highly-developed animal species. In addition, we show that the results are also applicable for the classic partial functional differential equations, where the time delays only appear in the reaction terms.},
