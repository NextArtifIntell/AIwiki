  abstract     = {A comprehensive toolkit is developed for regression analysis of directional data based on a flexible class of angular Gaussian distributions. Informative testing procedures to assess rotational symmetry around the mean direction, and the dependence of model parameters on covariates are proposed. Bootstrap-based algorithms are provided to assess the significance of the proposed test statistics. Moreover, a prediction region that achieves the smallest volume in a class of ellipsoidal prediction regions of the same coverage probability is constructed. The efficacy of these inference procedures is demonstrated in simulation experiments. Finally, this new toolkit is used to analyze directional data originating from a hydrology study and a bioinformatics application.},

  abstract     = {In the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries, sometimes the order of adding a set of components has an impact on the final product. These are instances of the Order-of-Addition (OofA) problem, which aims to find the optimal sequence of the components. Extensive research on this topic has been conducted, but almost all designs are found by optimizing the D −optimality criterion. However, when prediction of the response is important, there is still a need for I −optimal designs. Furthermore, designs are needed for experiments where some orders are infeasible due to constraints. A new model for OofA experiments is presented that uses transition effects to model the effect of order on the response. Three algorithms are proposed to find D − and I −efficient exact designs under this new model: Simulated Annealing, a metaheuristic algorithm, Bubble Sorting, a greedy local optimization algorithm, and the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), another metaheuristic algorithm. These three algorithms are generalized to handle block constraints, where components are grouped into blocks with a fixed order. Finally, two examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and models, even under block constraints.},

  abstract     = {In a Cox model, the partial likelihood, as the product of a series of conditional probabilities, is used to estimate the regression coefficients. In practice, those conditional probabilities are approximated by risk score ratios based on a continuous time model, and thus result in parameter estimates from only an approximate partial likelihood. Through a revisit to the original partial likelihood idea, an accurate partial likelihood computing method for the Cox model is proposed, which calculates the exact conditional probability using the Poisson-binomial distribution. New estimating and inference procedures are developed, and theoretical results are established for the proposed computational procedure. Although ties are common in real studies, current theories for the Cox model mostly do not consider cases for tied data. In contrast, the new approach includes the theory for grouped data, which allows ties, and also includes the theory for continuous data without ties, providing a unified framework for computing partial likelihood for data with or without ties. Numerical results show that the proposed method outperforms current methods in reducing bias and mean squared error, while achieving improved confidence interval coverage rates, especially when there are many ties or when the variability in risk scores is large. Comparisons between methods in real applications have been made.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth in modern science and technology, distributed longitudinal data have drawn attention in a wide range of aspects. Realizing that not all effects of covariates are our parameters of interest, we focus on the distributed estimation and statistical inference of a pre-conceived low-dimensional parameter in the high-dimensional longitudinal GLMs with canonical links. To mitigate the impact of high-dimensional nuisance parameters and incorporate the within-subject correlation simultaneously, a decorrelated quadratic inference function is proposed for enhancing the estimation efficiency. Two communication-efficient surrogate decorrelated score estimators based on multi-round iterative algorithms are proposed. The error bounds and limiting distribution of the proposed estimators are established and extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. An application to the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Dataset is also presented.},

  abstract     = {The assumption of constant variance is fundamental in numerous statistical procedures for time series analysis. Nonlinear time series may exhibit time-varying local conditional variance, even when they are globally homoscedastic. Two novel tests are proposed to assess the constancy of variance in time series with a possible time-varying mean trend. Unlike previous approaches, the new tests rely on Walsh transformations of squared processes after recentering the time series data. It is shown that the corresponding Walsh coefficients have desirable properties, such as asymptotic independence. Both a max-type statistic and an order selection statistic are developed, along with their asymptotic null distributions. Furthermore, the consistency of the proposed statistics under a sequence of local alternatives is established. An extensive simulation study is conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of the procedures in comparison with existing methodologies. The empirical results show that the proposed methods are more powerful in many situations while maintaining reasonable Type I error rates, especially for nonlinear time series. The proposed methods are applied to test the global homoscedasticity of a financial time series, a well log time series with a non-constant mean structure, and a vibration time series.},
