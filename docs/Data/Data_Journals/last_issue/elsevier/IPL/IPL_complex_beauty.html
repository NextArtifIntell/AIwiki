  abstract     = {This work examines the Conditional Approval Framework for elections involving multiple interdependent issues, specifically focusing on the Conditional Minisum Approval Voting Rule. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of this rule, demonstrating that no approach can significantly outperform the brute-force algorithm under common computational complexity assumptions and various natural input restrictions. In response, we propose two practical restrictions (the first in the literature) that make the problem computationally tractable and show that these restrictions are essentially tight. Overall, this work provides a clear picture of the tractability landscape of the problem, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the complications introduced by conditional ballots and indicating that conditional approval voting can be applied in practice, albeit under specific conditions.},

The goal is to compute the alternative that maximizes the total distance from all agents using a two-step mechanism which, given some information about the distances between agents and alternatives, first chooses a representative alternative for each group of agents, and then declares one of them as the overall winner. Due to the restricted nature of the mechanism and the potentially limited information it has to make its decision, it might not be always possible to choose the optimal alternative.

  abstract     = {The Quickhull algorithm is a simple algorithm for constructing the convex hull of a set of n points. Quickhull is usually described for points in the plane, in which case it is defined as a divide-and-conquer algorithm, where one has a pair of points ( p , r ) such that p and r are on the convex hull, and one then finds the point, q , farthest from the line p r ‾ , which must also be on the convex hull, and then uses the triangle ( p , q , r ) to divide the remaining points and recursively solve the resulting subproblems. It is well-known that Quickhull has a worst-case running time of Θ ( n 2 ) , but it runs much faster than this for some input distributions. In a highly cited paper, Barber, Dobkin, and Huhdanpaa conjecture that the Quickhull algorithm runs in worst-case O ( n log ⁡ h ) time, where h is the size of the convex hull, when the input points have precision O ( log ⁡ n ) . In this paper, we give an explicit lower-bound construction that shows that, in general, the worst-case running time of the Quickhull algorithm is Θ ( n h ) . Our lower bound proof also provides a counter-example to the Quickhull precision conjecture of Barber et al., in that we give an explicit construction of a set, S , of n points with precision O ( log ⁡ n ) such that h is O ( log ⁡ n ) but the worst-case running time of Quickhull on S is Θ ( n h ) , not O ( n log ⁡ h ) .},

  abstract     = {Given a two-prover game G and its two satisfying labelings ψ ini and ψ tar , the Label Cover Reconfiguration problem asks whether ψ ini can be transformed into ψ tar by repeatedly changing the label of a single vertex while preserving any intermediate labeling satisfying G . We consider its optimization version by relaxing the feasibility of labelings, referred to as Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration : We are allowed to pass through any non-satisfying labelings, but required to maximize the “soundness error,” which is defined as the minimum fraction of satisfied edges during transformation from ψ ini to ψ tar . Since the parallel repetition theorem of Raz (1998) [32] , which implies -hardness of approximating Label Cover within any constant factor, gives strong inapproximability results for many -hard problems, one may think of using Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration to derive inapproximability results for reconfiguration problems. We prove the following results on Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration , which display different trends from those of Label Cover and the parallel repetition theorem: • Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration can be approximated within a factor of 1 4 − o ( 1 ) for some restricted graph classes, including biregular graphs, balanced bipartite graphs with no isolated vertices, and superconstant average degree graphs. • A “naive” parallel repetition of Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration does not decrease the soundness error for every two-prover game. • Label Cover Reconfiguration on projection games can be decided in polynomial time. Our results suggest that a reconfiguration analogue of the parallel repetition theorem is unlikely.},

It is NP-hard to obtain a PTAS for the problem, even when d = 2 . For general d , the best-known approximation algorithm has an approximation guarantee that is exponential in d . In contrast, the best hardness of approximation is still a small constant inapproximability from the case when d = 2 . In this paper, we show that the problem cannot be approximated within a d 1 − ϵ factor unless NP = P . Recently, d -dimensional Vector Bin Packing, a problem closely related to the GBP, was shown to be hard to approximate within a Ω ( log ⁡ d ) factor when d is a fixed constant, using a notion of Packing Dimension of set families. In this paper, we introduce a geometric analog of it, the Geometric Packing Dimension of set families. While we fall short of obtaining similar inapproximability results for the Geometric Bin Packing problem when d is fixed, we prove a couple of key properties of the Geometric Packing Dimension which highlight fundamental differences between Geometric Bin Packing and Vector Bin Packing.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of modifying an instance of the stable matching problem with ties by deleting some bounded number of agents in such a way that there exists a super-stable matching in the modified instance. First, we consider the setting where we are allowed to delete agents on only one side. We prove that, in this setting, our problem can be solved in polynomial time. Interestingly, this result is obtained by carefully observing the existing algorithm for checking the existence of a super-stable matching. Next, we consider the setting where we are given an upper bound on the number of deleted agents for each side, and we are allowed to delete agents on both sides.

  abstract     = {Because many dissimilarity functions behave differently in low versus high-dimensional spaces, the behavior of high-dimensional nearest neighbor search has been studied extensively. One line of research involves the characterization of nearest neighbor queries as unstable if their query points have nearly identical dissimilarity with most points in the dataset. This research has shown that, for various data distributions and dissimilarity functions, the probability of query instability approaches one. Previous work in Information Processing Letters by C. Giannella in 2021 explicated this phenomenon for centered Gaussian data and Euclidean distance. This paper addresses the problem of characterizing query instability behavior over centered Gaussian data and a fundamentally different dissimilarity function, cosine dissimilarity. Conditions are provided on the covariance matrices and dataset size function guaranteeing that the probability of query instability goes to one. Furthermore, conditions are provided under which the instability probability is bounded away from one.},
