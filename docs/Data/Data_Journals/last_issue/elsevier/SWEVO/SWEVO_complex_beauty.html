  abstract     = {In the aircraft moving assembly line, the focus of the assembly line balancing problem is to balance the workload in each workstation, the scheduling of aircraft assembly lines must consider the parallel relationship between assembly tasks and meet supply constraints. The aircraft moving assembly line integration optimization problem integrates the aircraft assembly line balancing problem with the aircraft assembly line scheduling problem to enhance aircraft assembly efficiency. The decision involves allocating all assembly tasks to a given number of workstations, auxiliary decisions pertain to determining the start times for assembly operations and the number of operators required. The objective is to minimize the cycle time and smoothness of the assembly line while ensuring that the number of workers on the assembly line is minimized. An integer linear programming model has been established to solve the aircraft moving assembly line integration optimization problem, and a new decoding method has been designed for this problem. A Bayesian reinforcement learning-improved NSGA-II algorithm (RLINSGA-II) has been proposed. After non-dominated sorting, the population is hierarchically divided, and a selection strategy is established among individuals of different levels. Through Bayesian reinforcement learning formulas, the selection strategy undergoes continuous adjustment throughout the population iteration process, thereby enhancing the quality of offspring individuals produced by the crossover operator. Finally, five test cases of different scales were designed based on actual cases, and the proposed RLINSGA-II was compared with five multi-objective optimization algorithms. Computational experiments and a real case study reveal the superiority of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In today’s dynamic environment, companies must navigate highly competitive markets. They consistently need to implement new technologies and deliver the right product at the right time in response to customer demand. This necessitates a high level of adaptability and efficiency in their manufacturing processes. Flexible job-shops offer a more efficient alternative to traditional manufacturing practices by accommodating these needs. Additionally, in actual manufacturing plants, multiple jobs are typically required for each part type. To address this complexity, this article investigates the flexible job-shop scheduling problem with multiplicity (MFJSP). We propose a deep self-learning method based on deep reinforcement learning and fluid master-apprentice evolutionary algorithm (DSLFMAE) to minimize makespan for the MFJSP. The proposed DSLFMAE is the integration of a fluid master-apprentice evolutionary (FMAE) algorithm and a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. The FMAE algorithm serves as the core optimization method, employing the PPO algorithm to dynamically adjust the control parameters of the FMAE algorithm during the optimization process. Twelve state features are extracted to capture the evolutionary states of the FMAE algorithm accurately, and a long short-term memory Q-network (LSTM-Q) is designed to encode these continuous states. Subsequently, to adjust multiple interrelated control parameters of the FMAE algorithm simultaneously, a multivariate Gaussian distribution-based PPO algorithm is developed to train the LSTM-Q network. Numerical outcomes show the efficacy and superiority of the DSLFMAE in addressing the flexible job-shop scheduling problem with multiplicity (MFJSP) across different scales.},

  abstract     = {Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) are prevalent in real-world applications, where the evaluation of a single solution requires a significant amount of resources. In our study of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) in EOPs, we discovered an intriguing phenomenon. Because only a limited number of solutions are evaluated in each iteration, relying solely on these evaluated solutions for evolution can lead to reduced disparity in successive populations. This, in turn, hampers the reproduction operators’ ability to generate superior solutions, thereby reducing the algorithm’s convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose a strategic approach that incorporates high-quality, un-evaluated solutions predicted by surrogate models during the selection phase. This approach aims to improve the distribution of evaluated solutions, thereby generating a superior next generation of solutions. This work details specific implementations of this concept across various reproduction operators and validates its effectiveness using multiple surrogate models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly enhances the performance of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms. Compared to mainstream SAEAs and Bayesian optimization algorithms, our approach incorporating the un-evaluated solution strategy shows a marked improvement.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, the performance design of closed-chain legged mechanisms (CLMs) has not been adequately addressed. Most existing design methodologies have predominantly relied on trajectory synthesis, which inadvertently prioritizes less critical performance aspects. This study proposes a hierarchical multi-objective optimization strategy to address this limitation. First, the numerical performance-trajectory mapping is derived based on a foot-ground contact model, aiming to decouple the performance characteristics. Subsequently, a hierarchical optimization strategy is employed for two types of CLM design scenarios: In trajectory shape-constrained scenarios, a coarse-to-fine optimization process, integrating Fourier descriptors, refines the design from overall shape to local features. In scenarios without trajectory shape constraints, a stepwise optimization process is proposed for reconfigurable CLMs to transition from primary motion to auxiliary motion. The robustness of the proposed design strategy is validated across three configurations and seven algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed design strategy is verified by comparison with other existing CLM design methods. The applicability of the proposed strategy is confirmed through simulation and prototype experiments. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical strategy effectively addresses the challenges of precise performance design in CLMs. Our work provides a general framework for the CLM design and offers insights for the optimization design of other closed-chain linkages.},

The crucial issue in solving CMOPs is to balance constraints and objectives. This paper proposes a constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the correlation between objectives and constraints, termed CORCMO. CORCMO mainly comprises two stages: the learning stage and the evolving stage. The learning stage focuses on analyzing the correlation between each objective and constraints. In the evolving stage, the CMOP is decomposed into M constraint single-objective problems, which are optimized by M subpopulations cooperatively. For each subproblem, the corresponding fitness function, computed based on the correlation, is adopted to guide the evolution. Subsequently, CORCMO employs archive population update strategy to find the optimal solutions of the given CMOP. Experiments conducted on a series of benchmark problems demonstrate that CORCMO is promising to solve CMOPs.},

The distributed heterogeneous flexible job-shop scheduling problem considering automated guided vehicle transportation (DHFJSP-AGV) extends the classic flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) but remains underexplored. DHFJSP-AGV involves four subproblems: assigning jobs to heterogeneous factories, scheduling jobs to machines, sequencing operations on machines and transporting jobs between machines using AGVs. Due to its complexity, this study proposes an improved deep Q network (DQN) real-time scheduling method aimed at minimizing makespan. A mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) of DHFJSP-AGV is developed and transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP). Eight general state features are extracted and normalized to represent the state space, while appropriate combination dispatching rules are selected as the action space. The state features of each scheduling point are input to the DQN, determining the factory, job, machine, and AGV for each process. Additionally, double DQN and an improved ε-greedy exploration are used to enhance the DQN. Numerical comparison experiments under different production configurations and real-world application in distributed flexible job-shop with dynamic map environment demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of improved DQN.},

  abstract     = {As the personalized demand increases, the hybrid seru system (HSS) has emerged as an efficient production paradigm to address the volatile market and intricate production conditions due to its reconfigurability. To satisfy the actual production demands, it is common to consider multiple assembly stages in the HSS. However, the increasing complexity poses challenges for the design of scheduling optimization algorithms. In this paper, a learning-based dual-population optimization algorithm (LDPOA) is designed for the hybrid seru system scheduling problem with assembly. Based on a problem-specific decomposition paradigm, a dual-population cooperative search framework is proposed to enhance the exploration capability by focusing on different subproblem optimizations in different populations. During the evolution, a fusion strategy and filtering mechanism are designed to avoid invalid searches by allocating computing resources to more potential individuals. A learning-guided search mode selection strategy and a population communication strategy are proposed to further improve search efficiency and population diversity. Finally, the adjustment strategies are proposed to improve the solution quality by leveraging problem knowledge. Extensive experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the LDPOA. The comparisons show that the HSS can improve production efficiency by 35.3 % compared to the traditional manufacturing mode.},

We propose a joint offloading architecture that uses parked vehicles. Additionally, owing to the dynamic and uncertain nature of the environment, we model computation offloading as a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem to simultaneously optimize the latency and energy consumption of UE applications. In this study, we propose a dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a multi-strategy fusion response (DMOEA/D-MSFR). Specifically, we introduce a population center positioning strategy and a learnable prediction mechanism using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in DMOEA-MSFR, which divides the prediction optimization process into two stages and exhibits a rapid response to environmental changes. In the static optimization phase, an adaptive weight vector adjustment strategy is employed, which significantly aids in the distribution and diversity of the solutions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework balances the trade-off between latency and energy consumption, and the convergence, feasibility, and diversity of the non-dominated solutions obtained.},

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm based on fast dimensionality reduction and multi-objective differential evolution with redundant and preference processing (termed DR-RPMODE). In DR-RPMODE, the DR phase uses the freezing and activation operators to remove many irrelevant and redundant features in the high-dimensional datasets, thereby achieving fast dimensionality reduction. Subsequently, the RPMODE algorithm continues the search on the reduced datasets, improving the traditional differential evolutionary framework from two aspects: duplicated and redundant solutions are filtered by redundant handling, and a preference handling method that pays more attention to classification performance is designed for different preference objectives of decision-makers. In the experiment, DR-RPMODE is compared with seven feature selection algorithms on 16 classification datasets. The results indicate that DR-RPMODE outperforms the comparison algorithms on most datasets, demonstrating that it not only achieves outstanding optimization performance but also obtains good classification and scalability results.},

However, existing allocation methods often fall short of handling temporal constraints. This paper proposes a heuristic distributed and no-wait algorithm, called the Temporal-Constraints Performance Impact (TC-PI) algorithm, for solving multi-agent TAPs with temporal constraints. By requiring each agent either travels to or immediately executes its assigned task, the TC-PI eliminates unnecessary waiting time and effectively reduces the average task completion time . The proposed algorithm consists of three phases. Firstly, each agent sequentially adds tasks to its task list while ensuring temporal constraints are satisfied. Secondly, conflicts where multiple agents select the same task are resolved through local communication. Finally, any remaining conflicts caused by temporal constraints are further addressed. To maintain task order and minimize completion time, task significance is redefined by incorporating temporal relationships among tasks. A penalty mechanism prevents infinite task reallocation cycles, enhancing system robustness and avoiding deadlocks. Simulation results demonstrate that TC-PI effectively resolves temporal conflicts, achieves no-wait task allocations, and flexibly handles dynamic task arrivals.},

The complexity of this problem is further exacerbated when features arrive as a stream. Despite several attempts to solve OSFSS over feature streams, existing methods lack scalability, cannot handle interaction effects among features, and fail to efficiently handle high-velocity feature streams. To address these challenges, we propose a novel wrapper-for OSFSS named OSFSS-W (wrapper-for OSFSS), specifically designed to mine feature streams within the Apache Spark environment. Our proposed method incorporates (i) two vigilance tests: for removing (a) irrelevant features and (b) redundant features (ii) incremental learning and (iii) a tolerance-based feedback mechanism that retains and utilizes previous knowledge while adhering to the predefined tolerance thresholds. Additionally, for the purpose of optimization, we introduce a Bare Bones Particle Swarm Optimization (BBPSO-L) algorithm driven by the logistic distribution. Further, the BBPSO-L is parallelized within Apache Spark, following an island-based approach. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm on the datasets taken from the cybersecurity, bioinformatics, and finance domains. The results demonstrate that incorporating two vigilance tests coupled with a tolerance-based feedback mechanism significantly improved the median Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and median cardinality across all datasets.},

  abstract     = {The practices for comparing black-box optimization algorithms based on performance statistics over a benchmark suite are being increasingly criticized. Critics argue that these practices fail to explain why particular algorithms outperform others. Consequently, there is a growing demand for more robust comparison methods that assess the overall efficiency of the algorithms in terms of performance and also consider the specific landscape properties of the optimization problems on which the algorithms are compared. This study introduces a novel approach for comparing algorithms based on the concept of an algorithm footprint , which aims to identify easy and challenging problem instances for a given algorithm. A unique footprint is assigned to each algorithm and then compared, to highlight problem instances where an algorithm either uniquely succeeds or falls, as well as how the algorithms complement each other across the problem instances. Our solution employs a multi-task regression model (MTR) to simultaneously link the performance of multiple algorithms with the landscape features of the problem instances. By applying an Explainable Machine Learning (XML) technique, we quantify and compare the importance of the landscape features for each algorithm. The methodology is applied to a portfolio of three different BBO algorithms, highlighting their success and failure on the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) suite. The efficacy of our approach is further demonstrated through a comparative analysis with two existing algorithm comparison methods, showcasing the robustness and depth of insights provided by the proposed approach.},

This study evaluates the generalizability of AS models based on different problem representations in the context of single-objective continuous optimization. In particular, it considers the most widely used Exploratory Landscape Analysis features, as well as recently proposed Topological Landscape Analysis features, and features based on deep learning, such as DeepELA, TransOptAS and Doe2Vec.

However, many variants of the ABC algorithm fail to fully leverage the potential of each population, and their inherent random search strategies often limit the algorithm’s convergence capabilities, leading to diminished performance. To address these issues, we introduce an enhanced version of the ABC algorithm, which incorporates two essential features: adaptive population scaling and an elite-driven evolutionary strategy. The adaptive population scaling mechanism dynamically adjusts the population size of each bee colony based on their respective function, and the elite-driven evolutionary strategy with external archive makes bees evolve by utilizing information from elite individuals while ensuring diversity is maintained. These two features enhance the algorithm’s convergence ability. We employ the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 benchmarks to assess the optimization capabilities of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the EABC-AS algorithm displays significant competitiveness relative to CEC excellent algorithms and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCN) have attracted significant attention due to their superior performance in handling non-Euclidean spaces, which enables GCN to model and analyze complex data structures that cannot be handled by traditional methods. Neural network-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (NNMOEAs) have made significant strides, predominantly focusing on mapping the decision space to the objective space, but may fail to focus on the interconnectedness of solutions within the decision space. To address this problem, this paper proposes a two-stage multi-objective optimization algorithm that utilizes graph convolutional networks to enhance population evolution. In the initial stage, the algorithm employs cosine similarity to represent the population as graph-structured data. A hypervolume-guided self-attention update mechanism is then introduced to balance exploration and exploitation, achieved by establishing an exploratory neighborhood population alongside an expanded neighborhood population. In the subsequent stage, a key node detection strategy is implemented, which considers both the global influence and local mediation roles of nodes. This strategy selects individuals with highly concentrated information to generate new solutions, thereby facilitating a thorough exploration of the solution space. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against five state-of-the-art MOEAs across five benchmark test suites and five real-world problems. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in addressing robust, variable linkages and imbalance mapping multi-objective optimization problems, as well as its feasibility in practical problems.},

In this paper, a strengthened grey wolf optimization algorithm (SGWO) is proposed based on three strengthening mechanisms: the exponential decreasing convergence factor, the elite reselection strategy in per generation and the Cauchy mutation (CM) operator. Seven variants of SGWO are designed according to different deployment modes of three reinforcement mechanisms. Experiments on thirteen numerical optimization problems are carried out to compare the differences between GWO and SGWOs. The experimental results reveal that SGWOs can significantly improve the search performance of GWO in most tasks. Among them, SGWO7 is the most successful competitor. Furthermore, several optimizers have demonstrated through comparison on engineering design problems that SGWO7 outperforms the vast majority of competitors. Subsequently, MHHO, TLBO, GWO and SGWO7 are used to build automatic machine learning (AutoML) model. The experimental results of the four methods on MNIST dataset further illustrate the advantages of SGWO7 designed in this research.},

However, the selection of globally optimal particle is an important and challenging problem in the design of multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms. In this regard, this paper proposes an adaptive distance-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with simple position update, named ADMOPSO. First, an adaptive penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) distance strategy is designed to select the globally optimal particle from two elite particles which are randomly chosen from an elite particle set. This strategy better balances the diversity and convergence requirements of particle swarm optimization algorithm in the optimization process. Second, a simple position probabilistic update strategy is constructed to rewrite the velocity update method with the weight and use the learning rate to control the scale of the updated velocity in the position update equation to avoid particle swarm falling into the local optimum. Finally, an extensive experimental study is conducted to test the performance of several selected multi-objective optimization algorithms on ZDT, WFG and DTLZ benchmark problems, as well as 7 real-world problems were conducted to test the proposed algorithm. Comparative experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has significant advantages over other algorithms. This shows that the ADMOPSO algorithm is competitive in dealing with multi-objective problems.},

Additionally, ICEE-EO-MHRP deals with the IoT energy problem by incorporating a novel cost function that ends up of selecting Designated Relays (DRs) and backup DRs for the purpose of forwarding the traffic towards the sink node. Our protocol substantially reduces messages’ exchanges between IoT Sensor Nodes (SNs) by making the replacement of DCH and BDCH dependent on their energy levels dropping below a threshold. To ensure a balanced communication load and efficient scheduling, an innovative deterministic distributed-time division multiple access system is employed. Not only to this extent, but we address data redundancy issue, raised among those quite adjacent SNs, and accordingly propose an efficient management that guarantees having a coherent protocol. In addition to that, device and link failures are professionally addressed by suggesting recovery mechanisms that optimize the proposed protocol. Dealing with these impairments puts our approach well ahead of the competition since it addresses the most practical issues and scenarios, particularly those with challenging environmental constraints. The simulation results demonstrate primarily that our protocol significantly improves the network lifetime by 157.83 % and 109.81 % in comparison to Particle Swarm Optimization and Tabu Search (Tabu-PSO) and Energy-Efficient CH Selection by Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm utilizing Differential Evolution (EECHS-ISSADE), respectively. Comparing ICEE-EO-MHRP to Tabu-PSO and EECHS-ISSADE reveals improvements in residual energy of 335.87 % and 230.05 %, respectively. Furthermore, in comparison to Tabu-PSO and EECHS-ISSADE, the proposed protocol optimizes the throughput by 252.36 % and 168.64 %, respectively. In terms of average delay, our protocol outperforms Tabu-PSO, EECHS-ISSADE, PEGASIS with Artificial Bee Colony (PEG-ABC), Metaheuristics Cluster-based Routing Technique for Energy-Efficient WSN (MHCRT-EEWSN), as well as Hybrid Bald Eagle Search Optimization Algorithm (HBESAOA) by improvements of 57.53 %, 55.15 %, 86.89 %, 20.52 %, and 94.60 %, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) present the challenge of identifying multiple optimal solutions within a search space, requiring algorithms to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. To enhance solution accuracy, the local search methods often focus on elite individuals, allocating additional fitness evaluations (FEs) to refine their solutions. However, once the optima near these elite individuals are identified, continued allocation of FEs becomes inefficient, leading to a waste of limited resources. This highlights the inherent difficulty of achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation within the population under constrained resources. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new reinforcement learning-assisted differential evolution (RLDE) algorithm with adaptive resource allocation strategy. Firstly, the exploitation population is proposed, and the original population focuses on exploring undiscovered optimal regions and generating exploitation populations, while each exploitation population focuses on finding high-precision optima within its responsible optimal region. Secondly, a reinforcement learning-assisted adaptive resource allocation (RLRA) strategy is proposed to allocate FEs, which can reduce the waste of FEs and balance the exploration and exploitation ability among multiple populations. Finally, a local greedy mutation (LGM) strategy is proposed to help individuals evolve toward the neighborhood with better fitness values. Compared with 11 state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, the RLDE achieves better or more competitive results in all accuracy levels. Besides, the results on the dielectric composite optimization problem verify the practicality of RLDE.},

Nevertheless, making a good balance between the diversity and convergence of non-dominated solutions is a challenging issue that cannot be overlooked when MFFJSP is solved. To deal with these issues, this work proposes a Dynamic Quadratic Decomposition-based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (DQD-MOEA) to solve MFFJSP by minimizing makespan and total machine workload. To solve a problem that the distribution and diversity of searched non-dominant solutions are poor due to the discrete decision space and objective space of MFFJSP, it proposes a dynamic quadratic decomposition method. Its core idea is to eliminate all the failed reference vectors because they have no intersection with a real Pareto front, and ensure that solutions evolve along effective reference vectors. This work also introduces a problem-specific local search method to accelerate the solution convergence for MFFJSP. It proposes a hybrid initialization method to improve the quality of initial solutions. Finally, a series of experiments are performed and the results demonstrate that DQD-MOEA is significantly better than state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of convergence and solution diversity when solving widely-tested benchmark cases.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) face significant challenges when addressing dynamic multiobjective optimization problems, particularly those with frequent changes. The complexity of dynamic environments makes it difficult for MOEAs to accurately approximate the true Pareto-optimal solutions before subsequent changes occur. Typically, historical approximations of Pareto-optimal solutions are utilized to predict solutions in future environments. However, existing predictors often overlook the nondeterministic nature of historical solutions, potentially compromising prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel predictor based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimization. Unlike traditional deterministic predictors, our approach aims to provide a probability distribution of predicted results, thereby addressing the inherent nondeterminism of historical solutions. We employ GPR to model relationships among historical solutions across different time steps. Within the framework of the classical MOEA, MOEA/D, we introduce a new method MOEA/D-GPR for Evolutionary Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization (EDMO). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) network planning (RNP) is crucial for optimizing network performance by setting system parameters. The new bistatic RFID architecture with a distributed antenna system (DAS) offers advantages for the passive Internet of Things (IoT). It separates transmission and reception to minimize self-interference and extend uplink communication range, while using distributed antennas for broader coverage. Bistatic DAS RNP differs from monostatic in various aspects. Monostatic RNP focuses on factors like reader number, location, and power, while bistatic DAS RNP involves more parameters, including antenna and device numbers, locations, and interconnections. Coverage and interference are more complex, and practical planning faces constraints on antenna ports and feeder line length. Consequently, bistatic DAS RFID network planning (BDRNP) problems are novel, complex, high-dimensional, and constrained, making them relatively unexplored and highly challenging. This paper analyzes bistatic DAS RFID network coverage and interference, and proposes a mathematical model for BDRNP problems. A modified multi-objective discrete particle optimization (M2DPSO) algorithm is introduced, incorporating a modified k-means clustering method to group antennas, which ensures satisfaction constraints and reduces decision variable dimensionality from 4 | C S | + | C S | 2 to 4 | C S | to 4 | C S | where | C S | is the problem size. Redundant SDRs/carrier emitters are dynamically eliminated based on global best solution set changes. Experimental results show that M2DPSO algorithm significantly outperforms three existing popular algorithms – nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII), discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO), and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEAD) – by 265%, 361%, and 726% respectively, in average inverted generational distance (IGD) metrics.},

  abstract     = {Sparse Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (SMOPs) are commonly encountered in various fields such as machine learning, signal processing, and data mining. While evolutionary algorithms have shown good performance in tackling complex problems, many algorithms tend to exhibit performance degradation when dealing with SMOPs. The primary reasons for this performance decline are the curse of dimensionality and the inability to effectively leverage the sparsity of Pareto-optimal solutions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a model method to solve sparse multi-objective optimization problems through dynamic adaptive grouping and reward-penalty sparse strategies. Specifically, to obtain more effective prior information, a sparse initialization strategy is proposed in the initialization phase. This strategy aims to incorporate more prior knowledge and information about the sparsity of Pareto-optimal solutions. In the evolutionary phase, a decision variable dynamic adaptive grouping strategy is introduced. This strategy, combined with crossover and mutation operators, guides the population towards effective sparse directions. Furthermore, to further identify zero-value decision variables in Pareto-optimal solutions, a reward-penalty mechanism is designed to update the scores of decision variables. By combining this mechanism with the adaptive grouping strategy, this method can effectively flip low-scoring decision variables to zero with a higher probability. To validate the advantages of the proposed algorithm, experiments were conducted on eight benchmark problems, with comparative experiments conducted for different initialization methods. The results indicate that our algorithm exhibits significant advantages in solving SMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Many dynamic optimization problems in real-world domains like engineering and management science require considerations of robustness, where a balance between tracking optimal solutions in changing environments and managing costs of switching solutions is needed. However, in some cases, the objective functions are not analytically available and must be approximated based on data collected from numerical simulations or experiments. These dynamic problems are formulated as data stream driven robust optimization over time (DDROOT G ) problems, which cannot be satisfactorily addressed by existing dynamic optimization algorithms. Therefore, we propose a data stream driven multi-form evolutionary algorithm (DDMFEA), employing two separate Kriging models to approximate the unavailable objective function and the computationally expensive robustness estimation, respectively. In the proposed algorithm, DDROOT G problems are addressed with two distinct formulations with single- and multi-objectives. These formulations are utilized as a multi-form optimization process to mitigate the impact of approximation errors from both Kriging models. In addition, a novel solution selection mechanism is designed to consider both robustness and predicted objective values, facilitating the deployment of the optimal robust solution. Throughout the experiment, four robust comparison algorithms are employed to assess the performance of the proposed DDMFEA across various problems in different decision dimensions. The experimental results validate the significance of each proposed contribution and demonstrate the exceptional performance of DDMFEA.},

To tackle this, numerous Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed that combine Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) with surrogate models. Recently, researchers have conducted systematic surveys on SAEAs to better showcase their potential in solving EOPs. However, most of these efforts have focused on surrogate models, while largely overlooking EAs. This imbalance poses a challenge to the long-term development of SAEAs. Among various SAEAs, Surrogate-Assisted Differential Evolution (SADE) is widely favored by researchers due to the competitive performance of DE in Evolutionary Computation. It has been broadly applied across diverse engineering and scientific domains. Nevertheless, there is still no work that systematically investigates the progress of SADE. To balance the research direction of SAEAs and fill the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of SADE. Its contributions are summarized as follows: This paper first introduces the general optimization framework of SAEAs and briefly reviews the research directions and advances of its key components. Next, a comprehensive survey of SADE is conducted, covering commonly used surrogate models and DE algorithms. It also examines how existing SADE algorithms use DE, performance evaluation methods, and real-world applications. Finally, future challenges and potential research directions are discussed.

  abstract     = {Prediction-based strategies become increasingly prominent in addressing dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). However, challenges remain in selecting predictive models and effectively utilizing historical solutions. In this paper, we propose a multiple perspective dual-layer collaborative prediction strategy to efficiently tackle both challenges. The multi-perspective approach is further divided into a search perspective and a spatial perspective and realized through the collaboration of three sub-strategies. From the search perspective, we employ a dual-layer prediction strategy that focuses on both global and local information. Specifically, the first layer utilizes Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict centrality, which serves as a measure of the population’s collective intelligence. This layer effectively captures global insights into population dynamics, identifying overarching movement trends over time. Building on these global insights, the second layer employs a knee-point interval partitioning strategy that combines vector partitioning with knee-point-based predictions. This layer provides localized insights that complement the broader movement trends identified by the first layer. From the spatial perspective, we implement dual-layer historical similarity detection across non-dominated solutions in both decision and objective spaces. Specifically, the historical Pareto-similarity selection strategy identifies populations in these spaces that demonstrate the greatest similarity to the current population’s non-dominated solutions. The spatial perspective complements the search perspective, forming a coherent framework that systematically integrates global, local, and historical information. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs better than previous state-of-the-art methods.},

Feature learning is a powerful method in addressing this challenge, constituting a multi-objective problem aimed at maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing the number of learned features.

However, existing MOGP methods ignore the characteristics of feature learning tasks. Therefore, this work proposes a decomposition-based MOGP approach with a global replacement strategy for feature learning in data-efficient image classification. To handle the different value ranges of the two objectives, a transformation function is designed to uniform the range of the number of learned features. In addition, a preference-based decomposition strategy is proposed to address the preference for the objective of classification accuracy. The proposed approach is compared with existing MOGP methods for feature learning on five different image classification datasets with different numbers of training images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by achieving better HVs than or comparable to the existing MOGP methods in at least 13 out of 20 cases and classification accuracy significantly better than a popular neural architecture search method in all cases.},

  abstract     = {Effluent scheduling of wastewater treatment process (WWTP) is essential to ensure compliance with regulatory standards regarding effluent quality. Through the integration of pipe and plant systems, the influent can be estimated prior to entering the treatment process, providing additional information for scheduling. However, the traditional evolutionary computation methods face challenges in utilizing information from inflow estimation, resulting in decisions that do not account for long-term returns. For solving effluent scheduling problems with influent estimation, reinforcement learning can facilitate decision-making based on long-term environmental factors to improve the optimization ability of evolutionary computations. Thus, a framework of reinforcement learning-assisted particle swarm optimization algorithm (RLA-PSO) is proposed, using reinforcement learning part to generate solutions and guide optimization by learning from the influent estimation on a long-time scale. Meanwhile, it employs the optimization part to find the optimal solutions to intensify the learning effect of the reinforcement learning part. For the reinforcement learning part, a deep Q -network method with appropriate states and rewards is designed to efficiently learn the relationship between state, action and reward for the coming period. For the optimization part, a set-based particle optimization algorithm is employed to search for the optimized solution in a future period. The benchmark simulation model No.1(BSM1) is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed RLA-PSO algorithm for the effluent scheduling problem of WWTP. The computational experiments to the state-of-the-art methods show the proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance in effluent quality and process efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Interval many-objective evolutionary algorithms (IMaOEAs) have received significant achievements in recent years. However, it is difficult for the algorithm to quickly select good interval individuals since the uncertainty affects the definition of interval dominance relations. To further reduce the computational burden of uncertainty on the interval optimization process, this paper proposes a dual-sequence mechanism-guided interval many-objective evolutionary algorithm. First, the interval binary R2 evaluation indicator IR2 was designed, which can effectively evaluate the convergence and diversity of interval individuals. Second, an uncertainty dominance relation for interval individuals is proposed and uncertainty is quantified using the weighted LP norm (WLP). Finally, the dynamic dual-sequence (DDS) mechanism was ultimately employed to retain the most exceptional individuals within the population, while simultaneously eliminating those with subpar performance in terms of convergence, diversity, and uncertainty. To extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, 16 benchmark problems were used as the test suite. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach outperforms five advanced interval many-objective evolutionary algorithms, showcasing its superior performance and competitiveness.},

  abstract     = {A systems theory framework for swarm optimization algorithms promises the rigorous analysis of swarm behaviors and systematic approaches that could avoid ad hoc parameter settings and achieve guaranteed performances. However, optimization processes must treat various systems theory concepts, such as stability and controllability, differently, as swarm optimization relies on preserving diversity rather than reaching uniform agent behavior. This work addresses this duality of perspective and proposes State-Space Particle Swarm Optimization (SS-PSO) using the feedback concept in control systems theory. By exploiting the hidden analogy between these two paradigms, we introduce the concept of controllability for optimization purposes through state-space representation. Extending controllability to particle swarm optimization (PSO) highlights the ability to span the search space, emphasizing the significance of particles&#39; movement rather than their loss of diversity. Furthermore, adaptive exploration (AE) using an iterative bisection algorithm is proposed for the PSO parameters that leverages this controllability measure and its minimum singular value to facilitate explainable swarm behaviors and escape local minima. Theoretical and numerical analyses reveal that SS-PSO is only uncontrollable when the cognitive factor is zero, implying less exploration. Finally, AE enhances exploration by increasing the controllability matrix&#39;s minimum singular value. This result underscores the profound connection between the controllability matrix and exploration, a critical insight that significantly enhances our understanding of swarm optimization. AE-based State-Space-PSO (AESS-PSO) shows improved exploration and performance over PSO in 86 SOP and CEC benchmarks, particularly for smaller populations.},

Herein, we propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm based on a spiking neural network (SNN) to solve the multipoint satellite mission scheduling problem. Initially, we preprocess the mission–transition time by incorporating satellite attitude constraints and conceptualize the mission planning process as a Markov decision. Then, our methodology integrates SNN with PPO to effectively handle a high-dimensional state space by leveraging temporal information–processing capabilities. The SNN-based actor-critic network is trained to enhance the scheduling policy via PPO. Our method exhibits superior performance across various satellite orbits, satellite attitude maneuver speeds, and mission scales. In comparison with heuristic methods and traditional reinforcement learning techniques, our method shows a swifter convergence rate and an increased success rate of observation, coupled with superior convergence speed, robustness, and stability.},

  abstract     = {“Learning to optimize” design systems for evolutionary algorithm (EA) automatic design have become a trend, especially for differential evolution (DE). “Learning to optimize” design systems for EAs have two main parts: an excellent “backbone” algorithm with learnable components, and a learning scheme to determine the components of the “backbone” algorithm. A good “backbone” algorithm is of great importance for the algorithm design, because it determines the algorithm design space and potential. The learning scheme determines whether we can realize the potential or not. Existing studies generally choose one developed EA as the “backbone” algorithm, which constrains the potential of the design system because the “backbone” algorithm is relatively simple. To solve the problem and design a good EA, in this paper, we first propose a three-stage hybrid DE framework for single objective optimization, called SMS-DE, which implements single-objective DE, multi-objective DE, and single-objective DE sequentially. The multi-objective DE aims to enhance exploration ability. Second, we apply the framework to two advanced DEs, JADE and LSHADE, which results in two new algorithms: SMS-JADE and SMS-LSHADE. Third, the newly proposed algorithm, SMS-LSHADE, is considered the “backbone” algorithm, and the reinforcement learning method (Q-learning) is used to control the parameter for allocating computational resources to each stage, which results in another algorithm called QSMS-LSHADE. Experimental results on the CEC 2018 test suite show that SMS-DE, SMS-JADE, and SMS-LSHADE can perform significantly better than their counterparts and that SMS-QLSHADE performs the best among many developed DEs.},

Firstly, a decomposition method is introduced to divide the problem into multiple subproblems based on the level of interactions among the decision variables. For optimization, a multi-population search algorithm is proposed, where each subpopulation evolves individually. Finally, a machine learning-based prediction strategy is developed to learn information from historical solutions and predict some solutions that may be useful for the new environment. The proposed algorithm is tested using the generalized moving peaks benchmark problems. The results show that the proposed algorithm can find better solutions than existing approaches.},

To tackle this problem further, this paper assumes that customer waiting time within different ranges impacts service dissatisfaction differently. Then, it develops an efficient real-time scheduling strategy to decide the exact starting time of each customer&#39;s service at the first stage. Considering no-shows and non-punctual appointments, a knowledge-based biased random-key genetic algorithm ( K-BRKGA ) is used to determine the number of customers at each appointment slot, such that the total weighted cost associated with customers’ waiting time, providers’ idle time, and overtime at two stages can be minimized. Based on the data sets used, K-BRKGA reduces the total cost by 2.01 % and 1.01 % compared to the other two famous algorithms.},

To better solve this kind of problem, a decomposition and compression based algorithm (DCBA) is proposed to decompose the problem and compress the search space for efficient optimization. Firstly, three space compression based linear search methods are designed with two functionalities: (1) to carry out a quick and rough optimization and find relatively good initial solutions; (2) to gather important information of each dimension (decision variable) for subsequent processing. In the three linear search methods, we design ways to evaluate the search region and compress it into smaller regions that may contain better solutions. Then, four decomposition methods are designed for fully non-separable large-scale problems. These methods can generate as many as twenty-nine different decomposition results to enhance the decomposition diversity in order to make a better trade-off of the non-separability characteristic and the decomposition for complexity reduction of fully non-separable large-scale problems. Finally, a decomposition and compression based algorithm (DCBA) is proposed to solve large-scale problems. Numerical experiments are conducted on two widely used benchmark suites and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms are made. The results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient.},

This paper proposes the DPCMMOEA-BES algorithm, which is based on dual-population co-evolution and incorporates a balanced environmental selection (BES) component to solve CMMOPs. In DPCMMOEA-BES, parent information from dual populations is shared through the mating selection operator based on speciation to generate offspring. Additionally, the BES component proposed in this paper enhances the algorithm’s overall performance by utilizing the dynamic-range-based constrained dominance principle and the accurate selection operation based on global Bi-crowding Distance, where the introduction of Bi-crowding Distance effectively balances the diversity of solutions in both the objective and decision spaces. The BES component also demonstrates its potential as a universal plugin, which can be integrated into various constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The proposed DPCMMOEA-BES is evaluated on 31 test instances and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that it is a highly competitive approach. Moreover, the comparative results confirm that integrating the BES component significantly improves the algorithm’s performance in solving CMMOPs.},

While the first practicality will allow a focused set of preferred solutions to be found, the second practicality will enable finding robust yet high-performing non-dominated solutions. We propose and analyze four different approaches for finding preferred and robust solutions for handling both practicalities simultaneously. Our results on a number of two to 10-objective tests and engineering problems indicate the superiority of one specific approach. For a comprehensive evaluation of new EMO algorithms for finding a preferred and robust solution set, we also propose a new performance metric by identifying and utilizing a number of desired properties of such trade-off solutions.

  abstract     = {The agile earth satellite scheduling problem (AEOSSP) aims to output reasonable execution plans to manage observation requests and satisfy different user requirements. By analyzing the factors which impact the quality of satellite observation, a specific multi-objective AEOSSP (MO-AEOSSP) is studied, integrating observation profit and average image quality as optimization objectives. To overcome the limitations of traditional iterative methods, we introduce a multi-objective neural policy approach (MONP) which consists of problem decomposition, parameter initialization and subproblem modeling. Through problem decomposition a given MO-AEOSSP can be partitioned into several subproblems, subsequently modeled and trained as encoder–decoder structure neural networks. Various features including the most typical satellite attitude angle are characterized to support the MONP, while parameter transfer initialization is employed to accelerate the overall deep reinforcement learning procedure by leveraging params acquired from optimized subproblem. An end-to-end manner is implemented after all subproblems are trained to output the final non-dominated solutions. Experimental results on various scenarios demonstrate that MONP outperforms four representative multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in terms of metrics including Pareto Front, hypervolume and computational overhead, appearing remarkable ability of convergence, distribution, efficiency and scalability. Experiments further verify the effectiveness of the adopted parameter initialization strategy. To the best of our understanding, this study is an innovative attempt to combine the neural policy approach with MO-AEOSSP considering time-dependent satellite transition.},

  abstract     = {This study combined evolutionary algorithm and reinforcement learning to propose a new automated design method for generating swarm robots velocity controller model. It alternately evolves heterogeneous swarm and homogeneous swarm through a gene expression programming method that introduces reinforcement learning, and assembles function nodes and leaf nodes into new mathematical formulas during the evolution process. The method enable to realize the effect of swarm robots emerging to perform swarm tasks such as flocking and entrapping. What is more, a new swarm rule was discovered during the evolution process, which is used to realize the flocking of swarm robots at any angle. The experimental results show that the swarm motion controller automatically generated by the model has high task completion efficiency and strong generalization.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic optimization, which aims at optimizing the expected value of a stochastic objective function, is challenging and commonly-seen in engineering applications. One crucial challenge of stochastic optimization problems (SOPs) is that the objective function value is impossible to calculate accurately due to the existence of uncertainty. As probability distribution is a common mathematical tool for handling uncertainty, this paper intends to explore the use of probability-distribution-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving complicated SOPs. First, an in-depth analysis of how to sample and construct probability distributions for probability-distribution-based EAs in SOPs is performed through both empirical and theoretical studies. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the implicit averaging method is helpful for probability-distribution-based EAs to solve SOPs. Second, evolutionary algorithm based on multiple probability distribution models (EA-mPD) framework is proposed. Instead of using a single probability distribution, the whole population is divided into several clusters by clustering, and several local probability models are built for different clusters. Finally, probability-distribution-based EAs such as estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) are introduced in the proposed EA-mPD to solve SOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed EA-mPD method is promising in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},
