  abstract     = {We carry on a more detailed investigation of the composition of locally solid convergences as introduced in [6] , as well as the corresponding notion of idempotency considered in [4] . In particular, we study the interactions between these two concepts and various operations with convergences. We prove associativity of the composition and show that the adherence of an ideal with respect to an idempotent convergence is equal to its closure. Some results from [12] about unbounded modification of locally solid topologies are generalized to the level of locally solid idempotent convergences. A simple application of the composition allows us to answer a question from [6] about minimal Hausdorff locally solid convergences. We also show that the weakest Hausdorff locally solid convergence exists on an Archimedean vector lattice if and only if it is atomic.},

These conditions incorporate jumps in the Dirichlet traces both of the functions in the operator domains and of their Wirtinger derivatives and are non-local. Constructing a convenient generalized boundary triple, they may be parametrized by all compact self-adjoint operators in L 2 ( Σ ; C 2 ) . Whereas for all choices of parameters the essential spectrum is stable and equal to [ 0 , + ∞ ) , the discrete spectrum exhibits diverse behavior. While in many cases it is finite, we will describe also a class of parameters for which the discrete spectrum is infinite and accumulates at −∞. The latter class contains a non-local version of the oblique transmission conditions. Finally, we will connect the current model to its relativistic counterpart studied recently in [33] .},

To obtain our results, we develop a new global Carleman estimate for the forward stochastic parabolic adjoint system, with some terms in the H − 1 -space. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding observability inequality, and using the classical duality argument, we establish our null controllability result.

We use this fact to develop a smooth functional calculus for such elements. We also give some sufficient conditions for these algebras to be symmetric.

The MLF space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space that extends the classic Fock space and its reproducing kernel is given by the Mittag-Leffler function. We study the MLB transform and its main properties in the quaternionic setting. In this noncommutative setting there are two function theories that are prominent: the slice hyperholomorphic theory and the Fueter regular theory. The connection between the slice hyperholomorphic functions and the Fueter regular functions is given by the Fueter mapping theorem. The Mittag-Leffler Bargmann transform investigated in this paper maps the quaternionic-valued L 2 ( R , H ) space onto a counterpart of the MLF space in the Fueter regular setting. Finally the creation, annihilation, backward-shift and integration operators are studied in the case of the Fueter-MLF space.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study an interplay between local and global properties of spaces of minimal usco maps equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets. In particular, for each locally compact space X and metric space Y , we characterize the space of minimal usco maps from X to Y , satisfying one of the following properties: (i) compact, (ii) locally compact, (iii) σ -compact, (iv) locally σ -compact, (v) metrizable, (vi) ccc, (vii) locally ccc, where in the last two items we additionally assumed that Y is separable and non-discrete. Some of the aforementioned results complement ones of Ľubica Holá and Dušan Holý. Also, we obtain analogous characterizations for spaces of minimal cusco maps.},

Assuming that the initial data satisfy a natural compatibility condition, we show the local existence and uniqueness of the classical solutions for Oldroyd-B equations through some high-order estimations with respect to time weighting. To obtain the result, the initial density does not need to differ from zero and may vanish in an open subset (vacuum) of Ω or decay at infinity when Ω is unbounded.},

Let M k ( a , c ; n ) denote the number of k -colored partitions of n with a k -crank congruent to a mod c . For the cases k = 2 , 3 , 4 , Fu and Tang derived several inequality relations for M k ( a , c ; n ) using generating functions. We employ the Hardy-Ramanujan Circle Method to extend the results of Fu and Tang. Furthermore, strict log-subadditivity for M k ( a , c ; n ) is established.},

These generalized dichotomies are associated to growth rates satisfying mild conditions and they include the standard exponential behavior as a very particular case. As a nontrivial application, we establish the robustness property of such dichotomies under small (linear) perturbations.},
