A Laplacian-based model is proposed to govern the evolution of opinions in the group when the agents are subjected to external biases like agents’ traits, news, etc . The objective of the paper is to design a control input which leads to any desired opinion clustering even in the presence of external bias factors. Further, we also determine the conditions which ensure the reachability to any arbitrary opinion states. Note that all of these results hold for any kind of graph structure. Finally, some numerical simulations are discussed to validate these results.},

  abstract     = {We consider the optimal transport problem over convex costs arising from optimal control of linear time-invariant(LTI) systems when the initial and target measures are assumed to be supported on the set of equilibrium points of the LTI system. In this case, the probability measures are singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, thus not considered in previous results on optimal transport of linear systems. This problem is motivated by applications, such as robotics, where the initial and target configurations of robots, represented by measures, are in equilibrium or stationary. Despite the singular nature of the measures, for many cases of practical interest, we show that the Monge problem has a solution by applying classical optimal transport results. Moreover, the problem is computationally tractable even if the state space of the LTI system is moderately high in dimension, provided the equilibrium set lives in a low dimensional space. In fact, for an important subclass of minimum energy problems, such as control of the double integrator with minimum energy cost, the optimal transport map happens to coincide with that of the square Euclidean cost. We demonstrate our results by computing the optimal transport map for the minimum energy cost for a two dimensional double integrator, despite the fact that the state space is four dimensional due to position and velocity variables.},

This developed framework is an extension of the standard Gaussian one and suitable for both linear and nonlinear systems. The key to its implementation is calculating a series of integrals with the Gaussian weight form, which can be approximated by various numerical techniques. In addition, according to the rule of three-degree spherical-radial cubature, two specific filtering and smoothing algorithms of the proposed framework are presented.

  abstract     = {For the enhancement of the transient stability of power systems, the key is to define a quantitative optimization formulation with system parameters as decision variables. In this paper, we model the disturbances by Gaussian noise and define a metric named Critical Escape Probability (CREP) based on the invariant probability measure of a linearized stochastic process. CREP characterizes the probability of the state escaping from a critical set. CREP involves all the system parameters and reflects the size of the basin of attraction of the nonlinear systems. An optimization framework that minimizes CREP with the system parameters as decision variables is presented. Simulations show that the mean of the first hitting time when the state hits the boundary of the critical set, that is often used to describe the stability of nonlinear systems, is dramatically increased by minimizing CREP. This indicates that the transient stability of the system is effectively enhanced. It is also shown that suppressing the state fluctuations only is insufficient for enhancing the transient stability. In addition, the famous Braess’ paradox which also exists in power systems is revisited. Surprisingly, it turned out that the paradoxes identified by the traditional metric may not exist according to CREP. This new metric opens a new avenue for the transient stability analysis of future power systems integrated with large amounts of renewable energy.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based cooperative motion estimation is an important problem for many multi-robot systems such as cooperative aerial target pursuit. This problem can be formulated as bearing-only cooperative motion estimation, where the visual measurement is modeled as a bearing vector pointing from the camera to the target. The conventional approaches for bearing-only cooperative estimation are mainly based on the framework of distributed Kalman filtering (DKF). In this paper, we propose a new optimal bearing-only cooperative estimation algorithm, named spatial–temporal triangulation, based on the method of distributed recursive least squares. The design of the algorithm fully incorporates all the available information and the specific triangulation geometric constraint. As a result, the algorithm has superior estimation performance than the state-of-the-art DKF algorithms in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed as verified by numerical simulation. We rigorously prove the exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under practical challenging conditions, we develop a vision-based cooperative aerial target pursuit system, which is the first of such fully autonomous systems up to now to the best of our knowledge.},

One feature of this scheme is that it allows for implementing a flexible number of control inputs in each iteration, in a computationally attractive manner, while guaranteeing recursive feasibility and stability. The benefits of our flexible-step implementation are also demonstrated in an application to nonholonomic systems, where the one-step standard implementation may suffer from lack of asymptotic convergence.},

The definitions available in continuous-time suffer from an apparent paradox, as they do not properly account for the role of the average commutation frequency. In fact, we show that the entropy rate is the sum of a finite and an infinite component, the latter depending on the average commutation frequency. Thus, entropy maximization is meaningful only between chains that share the same average frequency. After settling this issue, we address entropy rate maximization under different constraints on the stationary probability: unconstrained, completely fixed, partially fixed. Closed-form solutions and provably convergent iterative algorithms are provided. The results are illustrated through several examples, including chains with string and lattice graph topology. Interesting connections with quantum mechanics topics (particle-in-a-box model, Born rule, and Anderson localization property) are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores a class of distributed optimal coordination problems with coupled objectives, incorporating features of distributed optimization and non-cooperative game. In this context, the local objective functions of agents depend on their own decisions as well as the decisions made by other agents. The objective of the agents is to achieve optimal coordination by minimizing the team objective function, which represents the average of all agents’ local objective functions. The main challenge lies in obtaining the partial derivatives of the team objective function, which are aggregations of all local objective functions’ partial derivatives and cannot be directly obtained by the agents. To tackle this problem, distributed optimal coordination control laws based on fixed-time estimation are developed. These control laws utilize distributed fixed-time estimators that enable agents to estimate the team decision and partial derivatives of the team objective function within a fixed time. The proposed distributed optimal coordination control laws guarantee the exponential convergence of the agents to the optimal states when the constraint sets are independent. Under the condition of a common constraint set, the proposed laws further ensure fixed-time optimal coordination. A numerical example involving coordinated dynamic positioning of a multi-agent system is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Our least-squares-based approach uses novel closed-form approximations of the Pontryagin difference between a constrained zonotopic minuend and a symmetric, convex, and compact subtrahend. We obtain these approximations using two novel canonical representations for full-dimensional constrained zonotopes. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not rely on convex optimization solvers, and is projection-free for ellipsoidal and zonotopic uncertainty sets. We also propose a least-squares-based approach to compute a convex, polyhedral outer-approximation to constrained zonotopes, and characterize sufficient conditions under which all these approximations are exact. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach in several case studies, including the design of abort-safe rendezvous trajectories for a spacecraft in near-rectilinear halo orbit under uncertainty.

  abstract     = {This paper studies online noncooperative games with dynamic regrets. Existing online noncooperative games rely on the sublinear growth of the path-length of Nash equilibrium sequences when considering dynamic regrets, which implies that their cost functions cannot be rapidly time-varying. Moreover, most of related results depend on undirected communication graphs. However, in many engineering practices, the cost functions may change greatly over time and the communication graphs may be directed. Here our problem involves rapidly time-varying cost functions, i.e., the path-length of Nash equilibrium sequences at least linearly grows, and the interaction topologies are unbalanced digraphs. In order to make decisions online without regrets, we develop a distributed algorithm based on multi-step mirror descents. Under the algorithm, sublinear dynamic regret bounds are established. More importantly, the dynamic regrets are independent of the path-length of Nash equilibrium sequences, compared with existing results. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, and demonstrate that our algorithm has better performance than other related algorithms.},

This paper focuses on the scheduling methods for the closed-loop Markov jump systems in the unreliable transmission environments to improve the system stability and save energy. First, a control unit including feedback controller and predictive controller is proposed which improves the system performance while reducing the complexity of predictive controller design. Second, we design a novel optimization indicator based on time-varying convergence rate and sensor energy consumption. Third, by analyzing the relationship between Lyapunov function and the system state, an explicit expression of the time-varying convergence rate is gained. Next, a constant χ is introduced to obtain the effective power set, in which the convergence rate is always less than 1, thereby ensuring the system stability. Based on this, the optimal power and bit scheduling algorithm is obtained, which improves the system convergence speed while reducing energy consumption. Last, a two-tanks system is used to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the main algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a one-shot learning approach with performance and robustness guarantees for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control of stochastic linear systems. Even though data-based LQR control has been widely considered, existing results suffer either from data hungriness due to the inherently iterative nature of the optimization formulation (e.g., value learning or policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms) or from a lack of robustness guarantees in one-shot non-iterative algorithms. To avoid data hungriness while ensuing robustness guarantees, an adaptive dynamic programming formalization of the LQR is presented that relies on solving a Bellman inequality. The control gain and the value function are directly learned by using a control-oriented approach that characterizes the closed-loop system using data and a decision variable from which the control is obtained. This closed-loop characterization is noise-dependent. The effect of the closed-loop system noise on the Bellman inequality is considered to ensure both robust stability and suboptimal performance despite ignoring the measurement noise. To ensure robust stability, it is shown that this system characterization leads to a closed-loop system with multiplicative and additive noise, enabling the application of distributional robust control techniques. The analysis of the suboptimality gap reveals that robustness can be achieved by construction without the need for regularization or parameter tuning. The simulation results on the active car suspension problem demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of robustness and performance gap compared to existing methods.},

Any one of these MDPs could be the model for some underlying controlled stochastic process, but it is unknown a priori which MDP is the ground truth. We investigate whether it is possible to asymptotically detect the ground truth MDP model perfectly based on a single observed history (state–action sequence). Since the generation of histories depends on the policy adopted to control the MDPs, we discuss the existence and synthesis of policies that allow for perfect detection. We start with the case of two MDPs and establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of policies that lead to perfect detection. Based on this condition, we then develop an algorithm that efficiently (in time polynomial in the size of the MDPs) determines the existence of policies and synthesizes one when they exist. We further extend the results to the more general case where there are more than two MDPs in the candidate set, and we develop a policy synthesis algorithm based on the breadth-first search and recursion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through numerical examples.},

We also examine approximation errors and the convergence of neural approximations to the unique solution of Zubov’s equation. We then provide sufficient conditions for the learned neural Lyapunov functions that can be readily verified by satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, enabling formal verification of both local stability analysis and region-of-attraction estimates in the large.

  abstract     = {Communication constraint is prominent under the networked architecture, for which the scheduling problem needs to be considered. This paper aims at validating scheduling-based stabilization for networked stochastic systems (NSSs) characterized by the presence of control-dependent noise. Remarkably, control-dependent noise has never been taken into account in the context of scheduling-based control. Such noise has intricate impact on system stability, and should not be simply treated as an unfavorable factor. As such, sophisticated analysis is entailed for scheduling-based control in the stochastic setting. However, no available theory on stochastic stability could support the application of dynamic scheduling protocols confronted with control-dependent noise, while the case via static scheduling protocols can resort to the existing results on stochastic differential equations with bounded-delay dependent diffusion coefficients. As the main contribution, a framework of scheduling-based stabilization is established for the NSSs, covering the architecture where a certain dynamic protocol rules the scheduling of sensor-to-controller information transmission. Crucially, a distinct pattern of stability analysis is proposed based on delicate comparison between the solutions under scheduling-based (discrete-time) and network-free (continuous-time) controls. As a consequence, an intrinsic relation between the system stability rendered by two types of controls is revealed, with the network-induced error on measured output suitably exploited. Based on the relation, we further propose several directly-verifiable conditions of achieving almost sure exponential stability for the NSSs with scheduling-based control via try-once-discard protocol, the most typical one among dynamic scheduling protocols. Particularly, incorporating the underlying positive effect of the stochastic noise, one of the conditions allows the Lyapunov function candidates to have non-negative infinitesimal under corresponding continuous-time control, while no counterpart exists in the non-stochastic setting.},

We assume that the unknown parameter vector lies in a convex compact set such that the high-frequency gain matrix remains invertible for any parameter vector value in the set. These assumptions allow for a successful design of a robust model reference adaptive controller. A numerical example is included to fully illustrate the controller design and the effectiveness of the controller. As compared with the recent paper Pan and Başar (2023), the problem with uniform vector relative degree of zero allows us to relieve the block diagonally identical backbone structure for the measurement channels, choose a general quadratic cost structure that weighs the tracking errors arbitrarily, and achieve optimality for the control design.},

The key contribution is the development of a weight-matrix-based position constraint, which can make use of relative measurements such as bearing, ratio-of-distance, angle, distance, relative position and their mixture to describe the position relationship among each follower and its neighbors in 3-D space. A bearing-based distributed protocol is proposed for each follower to estimate its position and track its target position, which can drive the followers from their unlocalizable positions to localizable positions. The proposed algorithm is then extended to the case that both bearing and ratio-of-distance measurements are available, where the followers are localizable at all times if the followers and their neighbors are not collocated. In addition, the proposed method is also applicable to homogeneous or heterogeneous angle, distance, and relative position measurements as the ratio-of-distances or bearings can be obtained indirectly by these relative measurements. A remarkable advantage is that the proposed method can be implemented without persistently exciting motions. Some illustrative simulations are presented to verify the theoretical results.},

A novel distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework is proposed, where each UAV is equipped with an individual controller that adopts a hierarchical architecture comprising three sequentially connected control layers. The outer layer, integrating the Lyapunov-based MPC method with an adaptive parameter estimator, determines translation tracking control actions. The intermediate layer enforces the convergence of actual rotation angles toward the desired ones determined by the outer layer. The inner layer generates the torque control commands for rapid convergence of the angular velocities. The closed-loop stability of the entire multi-UAV system is rigorously analyzed, and sufficient conditions regarding the selection of user-defined parameters are established.

  abstract     = {Learning control methods have been widely enhanced by reinforcement learning, but it is challenging to analyze the effects of incorporating extra system information. This paper presents a novel multi-step framework that utilizes extra multi-step system information to solve optimal control problems. Within this framework, we establish and classify general multi-step value iteration (MsVI) algorithms based on the uniformity between policy evaluation and improvement stages. According to this uniformity concept, the convergence condition and the acceleration conclusion are analyzed for different kinds of MsVI algorithms. Besides, we introduce a swarm policy optimizer to relieve limitations of the traditional gradient optimizer. Specifically, we implement general MsVI using an actor–critic scheme, where the swarm optimizer and neural networks are employed for policy improvement and evaluation, respectively. Furthermore, the approximation error caused by the approximator is also considered to verify the advantage of using multi-step system information. Finally, we apply the proposed method to a nonlinear benchmark system, demonstrating superior learning ability and control performance compared to traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach towards synchronization analysis of nonlinear networked systems, directionally coupled via a generic network topology, under asynchronous, aperiodic sampled-data linear coupling. The synchronization dynamics of the networked system is remodelled as a feedback-interconnection of an operator that captures the continuous-time synchronization dynamics, i.e., in the absence of sampled data transmission, and an operator that accounts for these communication constraints. By studying the properties of this feedback-interconnection in the framework of dissipativity theory, we provide a novel criterion that guarantees exponential synchronization. The provided criterion also aids in deciding the trade-off between bounds on time-varying, uncertain sampling intervals, the coupling gain, and the desired transient rate of synchronization, while taking into account the network topology. The theoretical results are illustrated using a networked FitzHugh–Nagumo neuron system.},

  abstract     = {A two-player game-theoretic problem on resilient graphs in a multiagent consensus setting is formulated. An attacker is capable to disable some of the edges of the network with the objective to divide the agents into clusters by emitting jamming signals while, in response, the defender recovers some of the edges by increasing the transmission power for the communication signals. Specifically, we consider repeated games between the attacker and the defender where the optimal strategies for the two players are derived in a rolling horizon fashion based on utility functions that take both the agents’ states and the sizes of clusters (known as network effect) into account. The players’ actions at each discrete-time step are constrained by their energy for transmissions of the signals, with a less strict constraint for the attacker. Necessary conditions and sufficient conditions of agent consensus are derived, and the number of clusters of agents at infinite time in the face of attacks and recoveries is also characterized. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effects of players’ actions on the cluster forming and to illustrate the players’ performance for different horizon parameters.},

  abstract     = {This paper designs scheduling schemes for a sensor with multiple power levels to minimize estimation error over a finite time. Under the sensor energy constraint, two algorithms are proposed to design scheduling schemes. One is a dynamic programming algorithm that constructs optimal scheduling schemes, but it is time-consuming and sensitive to the initial estimation error covariance. To address this, the second algorithm based on Nash equilibrium is developed to construct approximately optimal schemes. This algorithm not only ensures time-efficient but also allows for changes in the initial estimation error covariance. Finally, one numerical example illustrates the superiority of our proposed algorithms.},
