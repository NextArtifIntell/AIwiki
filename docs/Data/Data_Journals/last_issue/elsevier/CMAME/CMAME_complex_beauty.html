  abstract     = {The development direction of high reliability and longer serviceable life for major equipment requires accurate fatigue life predictions of additively manufactured (AM) components. However, small samples and high scatter of fatigue performance have become significant challenges in accurately modeling the fatigue failure behavior of AM components. To overcome the limitation of traditional fatigue life prediction models, a multi-fidelity physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework is proposed. In this framework, the uncertainty quantification of fatigue performance and the fitting low-fidelity fatigue data with physical consistency are achieved through a physics-guided Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP). The introduced concept of transfer learning allows training a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) using multi-fidelity fatigue data during the training process. Embedding the effect of manufacturing defects on fatigue performance as physical constraints can ensure the physical consistency of the overall multi-fidelity framework. Compared with traditional neural network (NN) and PiNN, the multi-fidelity framework has significant advantages in strong prediction performance, generalization ability and effectiveness. Moreover, the results of deep feature transfer demonstrate that the proposed multi-fidelity framework is expected to be a unified fatigue life prediction framework for AM materials.},

  abstract     = {The real microstructures of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) play a crucial role in determining their damage behavior. However, considering the real microstructure within the high-fidelity numerical simulation usually leads to expensive computational costs. In this study, an end-to-end deep-learning (DL) framework is proposed to predict the evolution of damage fields for CMCs from their real microstructures, which are characterized through computed tomography (CT). Three sub-networks, including the microstructure processing network (MPN), elastic deformation prediction network (EPN), and damage sequence prediction network (DPN), are used to construct a two-stage DL model. In the first stage, the geometrical characteristics of real microstructure are precisely captured by the MPN with over 92 % precision for the yarns and matrix. In the second stage, the elastic deformation predicted by the EPN is taken as the intermediate variable to motivate the damage prediction of DPN with the MPN-predicted microstructure as input. The damage evolution of real microstructure is finally predicted with a mean relative error of 10.8 % for the primary damage variable fields. The high-damage regions in the microstructure can also be accurately captured with a mean precision of 87.9 %. The proposed model is further validated by the in-situ tensile experiment. The micro-cracks are proven to initiate and propagate in the high-damage regions. Compared with the high-fidelity numerical methods, this DL-based method can predict the damage evolution on the fly, avoiding time-consuming computation and poor convergence during the damage analysis.},

  abstract     = {Embedded boundary methods (EBMs) for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and nonlinear fluid–structure interaction (FSI) – also known as immersed boundary methods, Cartesian methods, or fictitious domain methods – are the most robust methods for the solution of flow problems past obstacles that undergo large relative motions, significant deformations, large shape modifications, and/or surface topology changes. They can also introduce a high degree of automation in the task of grid generation and significant flexibility in the gridding of complex geometries. However, just like in the case of their counterpart body-fitted methods, their application to parametric flow computations at high Reynolds numbers remains today impractical in most engineering environments. For body-fitted CFD, the state of the art of projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) has significantly advanced during the last decade and demonstrated a remarkable success at reducing the dimensionality and wall-clock time of high Reynolds number models, while maintaining a desirable level of accuracy. For non-body-fitted CFD however, PMOR is still in its infancy, primarily because EBMs dynamically partition the computational fluid domain into real and ghost subdomains, which complicates the collection of solution snapshots and their compression into a reduced-order basis. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper presents a robust computational framework for PMOR in the context of high Reynolds number flows and in the EBM setting of CFD/FSI (PMOR-EBM). The framework incorporates a hyperreduction approach based on the energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) method to accelerate the evaluation of the repeated projections arising in nonlinear implicit computations; and a piecewise-affine approach for constructing a nonlinear low-dimensional approximation of the solution to mitigate the Kolmogorov n -width barrier to the reducibility of transport models. The paper also assesses the performance of the proposed computational framework PMOR-EBM for two unsteady turbulent flow problems whose predictions necessitate or benefit from the application of an EBM; and two shape-parametric steady-state studies of the academic type but of relevance to design analysis and optimization.},

In this work, we observe the significant role of correctly weighting the combination of multiple competitive loss functions for training PINNs effectively. To this end, we implement and evaluate different methods aiming at balancing the contributions of multiple terms of the PINN’s loss function and their gradients. After reviewing three existing loss scaling approaches (Learning Rate Annealing, GradNorm and SoftAdapt), we propose a novel self-adaptive loss balancing scheme for PINNs named ReLoBRaLo (Relative Loss Balancing with Random Lookback). We extensively evaluate the performance of the aforementioned balancing schemes by solving both forward as well as inverse problems on three benchmark PDEs for PINNs: Burgers’ equation, Kirchhoff’s plate bending equation, Helmholtz’s equation and over 20 PDEs from the ”PINNacle” collection. The results show that ReLoBRaLo is able to consistently outperform the baseline of existing scaling methods in terms of accuracy while also inducing significantly less computational overhead for a variety of PDE classes.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the multiphysical coupling between a deformable structural body and the forces imposed on that body from a surrounding fluid can be a challenging and computationally expensive task, especially when the structure, fluid, or both exhibit nonlinear behavior. Consequently, there exists a need for novel reduced-order static aeroelasticity analysis techniques that make efficient use of high-fidelity computational models, especially for preliminary design of next-generation aerostructures with high-aspect ratio lifting surfaces exhibiting large deformations or in situ geometric reconfigurations driven by nonlinear mechanisms. This work presents the compositional static aeroelastic analysis method: an embarrassingly parallelizable data-driven modeling technique that seeks to construct a system-level aeroelastic surrogate model representing the function composition of high-fidelity structural and fluid models in terms of shape parameters characterizing a reduced-order geometric description of the deformed fluid–structure interface. By formulating the static aeroelasticity problem as a fixed point problem, the proposed reduced-order modeling framework removes the need for a reduced-order representation of the traction field acting on the structure, unlike previous data-driven methods that independently train separate fluid and structural surrogate models. Additionally, by replacing the iterative exchange of full-order aeroelastic coupling variables with a statistical exploration of a reduced-order shape parameter space, the minimum computational time for approximating a static aeroelastic response is equivalent to one set of high-fidelity fluid and structural model evaluations. The following work presents the theoretical development of the proposed compositional method and demonstrates its use in two case studies, one of which involves a cantilevered baffle comprised of linear and nonlinear material with large deformations exceeding 35%. Numerical results show close agreement with a conventional partitioned analysis scheme, where tip displacement error is less than 1% in both material cases. It is also demonstrated how traction field information can be reused when considering structural modifications to circumvent the need for additional computationally expensive fluid model evaluations.},

The traditional homogenization method may face challenge due to extremely expensive computational cost, when the non-linear effective viscosities on all the directions of Particle Reinforced Thermoplastics (PRT) are demanded. This paper approaches this challenge with the FEM-Cluster based reduced order Analysis (FCA) method [1]. The governing equations are solved by minimizing a cluster-based dual formulation of the dissipating energy, where the cluster-wise Admissible Shear Stress (ASS) set is obtained by FCA together with a Spectrum Analysis Algorithm (SAA). In addition, considering the fact that there is a lack of effective method for determining the proper number of clusters, a cluster metric is developed, which relates the given number of clusters and the prediction accuracy of FCA method. This metric can be easily used in the offline stage to pre-estimate the applicability of the obtained clusters on the given loading conditions with a small amount of additional computation.},

  abstract     = {Allen–Cahn equation is a reaction–diffusion equation and is widely used for modeling phase separation. Machine learning methods for solving the Allen–Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives, and the large system size required by the space–time approach. To overcome these challenges, we propose solving the L 2 gradient flow of the Ginzburg–Landau free energy functional, which is equivalent to the Allen–Cahn equation, thereby avoiding the second-order spatial derivatives associated with the Allen–Cahn equation. A minimizing movement scheme is employed to solve the gradient flow problem, eliminating the complexities of a space–time approach. We utilize a separable neural network that efficiently represents the phase field through low-rank tensor decomposition. As we use the minimizing movement scheme to numerically solve the gradient flow problem, we thus, refer to the proposed method as the Separable Deep Minimizing Movement (SDMM) method. The evaluation of the functional in the minimizing movement scheme using the Gauss quadrature technique bypasses the inaccuracies associated with collocation techniques traditionally used to solve partial differential equations. A hyperbolic tangent transformation is introduced on the phase field prior to the evaluation of the functional to ensure that it remains strictly bounded within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that this transformation helps to improve the accuracy and efficiency significantly. The proposed method resolves the challenges faced by state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, outperforming them in both accuracy and efficiency. It is also the first machine learning method to achieve an order of magnitude speed improvement over the finite element method. In addition to its formulation and computational implementation, several case studies illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. 1},

For smooth problems, the resulting Jacobian matrix is algorithmically exact: while the equations of motion are approximated using a user-selected time-integration scheme, the differentiation of the computed solution is performed exactly. This approach eliminates the need for numerical differentiation, significantly improving both the efficiency and robustness of the path-following process. Although the theoretical framework assumes differentiability, the method effectively handles piecewise smooth problems as well. Numerical tests demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to traditional techniques that rely on numerical differentiation.

  abstract     = {Surrogate modeling plays an increasingly important role in engineering design. The present work develops a novel surrogate model, region-optimal Gaussian process (roGP), to accurately emulate cold-flow and combustion fields in a significantly short time period. The model leverages an advanced statistical approach, Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model, to partition the entire spatial domain of concern into discrete subregions in a physics-informed manner. Each subregion contains the common features embedded in the collected dataset and is modeled by a Gaussian process (GP) with shared hyperparameters. Additionally, an active learning strategy iteratively refines the training dataset by prioritizing high-uncertainty regions, further enhancing predictive accuracy. The roGP model is evaluated on three representative cases of increasing complexity, consistently outperforming conventional GP-based surrogates. Results show that roGP effectively mitigates overfitting in independent GP models and reduces information loss in proper-orthogonal-decomposition GP models. In all test cases, roGP achieves superior spatial prediction accuracy, with relative root mean square errors below 5.5 %. A unique characteristic of the roGP model is that the DP-optimized subregions of roGP connect physics-alike coordinates among sampling design points. The entire pressure field in cold-flow case is effectively described by five subregions, while physical fields in two combustion cases require the elevated number of subregions due to their increased complexity. roGP achieves substantial acceleration in prediction time, up to eight orders of magnitude faster than numerical simulations.

  abstract     = {A novel explicit Dual-Mesh virtual element method (DM-VEM) for two dimensional nonlinear dynamic problems is proposed. The DM-VEM employs an Eulerian background grid to solve the momentum equation of the virtual element method (VEM), which significantly improves the spatial stability and the temporal stability of the VEM. An explicit critical time step formula is first developed for one dimensional problems and then extended to two dimensional problems, which takes the effect of vertex position and neighboring cell interaction into consideration. An efficient Lagrangian multiplier contact method based on the background grid is also proposed to deal with contact phenomena. Several numerical examples are studied to verify the proposed explicit DM-VEM in nonlinear dynamic problems.},

  abstract     = {Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites have extensive applications in aerospace, automobile, marine and sports industries, however, the process-induced residual stress developed during the cure process can lead to microcracks and weaken the macroscopic mechanical performance. In this work, we developed a multiscale PD framework for modeling thermo-chemo-mechanical behaviors of FRP composites for the first time. The whole cure process is modeled by a macroscale thermo-chemical coupling behavior of the FRP specimen followed by a microscale thermo-chemo-mechanical coupling process of the representative volume element (RVE) taken from the macro specimen. After the multiscale cure modeling, the resulted residual stress distribution is maintained when applying the mechanical loading. The proposed PD framework was validated by examining the temperature and degree of cure histories and the stress-strain curves against experimental data. The effects of periodic boundary condition (PBC) treatments, fiber content, fiber distribution and chemical shrinkage are explored. Cure-induced residual stress can amplify the local stress concentration and damage in the fiber‒matrix interfaces. Results show that PBC treatments have negligible influence on the final damage distribution while the fiber content and distribution can pose huge impact on the strain and stress history of the RVE. In addition, chemical shrinkage can complicate the stress state and impact the mechanical response of composites. This model can serve as a potential tool for predicting the process-induced residual stress and damage and contributes to improved composites designs.},

To this end, we consider interpolation trial spaces that satisfy the de Rham Hilbert subcomplex, providing stable and structure-preserving neural network discretisations for a wide variety of PDEs. This approach, coined compatible FEINNs, has been used to accurately approximate the H ( curl ) inner product. We numerically observe that the trained network outperforms finite element solutions by several orders of magnitude for smooth analytical solutions. Furthermore, to showcase the versatility of the method, we demonstrate that compatible FEINNs achieve high accuracy in solving surface PDEs such as the Darcy equation on a sphere. Additionally, the framework can integrate adaptive mesh refinements to effectively solve problems with localised features. We use an adaptive training strategy to train the network on a sequence of progressively adapted meshes. Finally, we compare compatible FEINNs with the adjoint neural network method for solving inverse problems. We consider a one-loop algorithm that trains the neural networks for unknowns and missing parameters using a loss function that includes PDE residual and data misfit terms. The algorithm is applied to identify space-varying physical parameters for the H ( curl ) model problem from partial, noisy, or boundary observations. We find that compatible FEINNs achieve accuracy and robustness comparable to, if not exceeding, the adjoint method in these scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in deep learning. KANs have already been integrated into various architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, and their potential has been assessed for predicting physical quantities. However, the combination of KANs with point-cloud-based neural networks (e.g., PointNet) for computational physics has not yet been explored. To address this, we present Kolmogorov–Arnold PointNet (KA-PointNet) as a novel supervised deep learning framework for the prediction of incompressible steady-state fluid flow fields in irregular domains, where the predicted fields are a function of the geometry of the domains. In KA-PointNet, we implement shared KANs in the segmentation branch of the PointNet architecture. We utilize Jacobi polynomials to construct shared KANs. As a benchmark test case, we consider incompressible laminar steady-state flow over a cylinder, where the geometry of its cross-section varies over the data set. We investigate the performance of Jacobi polynomials with different degrees as well as special cases of Jacobi polynomials such as Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, and Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of the computational cost of training and accuracy of prediction of the test set. Furthermore, we examine the robustness of KA-PointNet in the presence of noisy training data and missing points in the point clouds of the test set. Additionally, we compare the performance of PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) and PointNet with shared MLPs. It is observed that when the number of trainable parameters is approximately equal, PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) outperforms PointNet with shared MLPs. Moreover, KA-PointNet predicts the pressure and velocity distributions along the surface of cylinders more accurately, resulting in more precise computations of lift and drag.},

  abstract     = {Effectively estimating output probability distributions in stochastic static and dynamic systems with a limited number of simulations is a significant challenge, especially for complex distributions with multi-modality and heavy tails. To address this challenge, this work explores the potential of the Laplace Transform (LT) and its inversion. First, the statistical information embedded in the derivatives of the LT is analysed, establishing the theoretical foundation for recovering output probability distributions. Subsequently, a novel analytical expression for the response probability density function (PDF) is derived by decomposing its inverse LT (ILT) using Euler’s formula. Building on the numerically estimated LT, a non-parametric numerical solution, termed the Numerical Decomposed ILT (NDILT) algorithm, is developed to flexibly estimate the main body of complex PDFs with limited samples. Second, the Taylor expansion of the real component of LT (RCLT) reveals its rich statistical content. Exploiting this property, another parametric method, the LT-based Maximum Entropy Method (LT-MEM), is proposed, incorporating estimated RCLT as constraints of the maximum entropy principle. By solving an optimization problem, LT-MEM can effectively reconstruct complex PDFs across their entire distribution domain using a small sample size. The proposed methods rediscover and harness the power of the LT and ILT to reconstruct complex-shaped probability distributions, offering a valuable alternative. Parameter selection strategies for NDILT and LT-MEM are provided, and their robust accuracy is validated through analytical and numerical examples across various challenging distributions.},

  abstract     = {Spatial truss structures represent a robust, cost-effective, and efficient lightweight design, especially when isotropic materials are substituted with lightweight materials such as composites. During early design phases, truss structures are often subject to optimisations. In order to achieve this in an efficient manner, it is essential to employ a precise yet cost-effective computational model. The most common methodology for the analysis of spatial truss structures employs hinged joints in conjunction with struts that are only subject to tension or compression. However, this approach does not account for the bending and coupling effects inherent to struts manufactured from composite materials. In particular, when employing asymmetric laminates, these effects can no longer be ignored. In order to incorporate these effects, it is common practice to use Finite Element Analysis tools. Particularly for large spatial truss structures comprising struts with slender and thin-walled cross-sections, a large number of solid or shell elements is required, which results in time-consuming simulations. This contribution presents a fully analytical thin-walled composite beam element, applicable to an arbitrarily shaped, closed cross-section. The beam model incorporates two distinct composite material models, namely the Classical Laminate Plate Theory and the First Order Shear Deformation Theory. Moreover, it is capable of simulating asymmetric laminates and modelling the coupling effects within these laminates. Utilising the exact third-order solution of a composite Timoshenko - Ehrenfest beam enables the locking-free representation of an individual strut with a single beam element. In comparison to the conventional shell / solid Finite Element Analysis, this approach results in a substantial reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, by a factor of several orders of magnitude. As a result, the required computational time is significantly reduced. In the case of a single strut, the computational time is reduced by a factor between 160 and 430. For an exemplary truss structure comprising 64 struts, a reduction in computational time of approximately 100 000 times is reached. The numerical comparisons presented in this contribution demonstrate that the model is highly accurate, particularly for tubular and elliptical cross-sections including symmetric and asymmetric laminates.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a Virtual Element formulation (VE) for shear-deformable elastic plates. In particular, the Hybrid Virtual Element Method (HVEM) is adopted, which assumes a self-equilibrated stress interpolation and an energy-based projection, eliminating the need for stabilization terms. This choice, together with a cubic linked interpolation for displacement and rotations, makes the approach free from locking, even for very thin plates and highly distorted element geometries. These features enable the proposed VE to achieve high accuracy even for coarse meshes, yielding low errors when compared to analytical solutions and providing a smooth reconstruction of all the stress field components. Furthermore, low error in both the displacement and stress fields are obtained in the challenging case of single element polygonal discretization. The same performance are guaranteed in presence of bulk loads, thanks to a consistent treatment within the projection operation that a-priori assumes equilibrium for the stress field interpolation. A random-based benchmark is proposed for assessing numerically the absence of spurious modes in concave and convex distorted elements. The proposed HVEM for plate is validated in classical benchmark problems, demonstrating the superior accuracy of polygonal meshes compared to the quadrilateral ones, for an equivalent number of degrees of freedom. This result is relevant in all the applications where polygonal element shapes are necessary. In addition, it opens up the way to new modeling scenarios where polygonal meshes are preferred not only for their versatility but also for their enhanced accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The optimization design of the microstructures and their macro distribution in porous composite structures (PCS) offers significant potential for achieving both lightweight and functional performance. This paper proposes a novel optimization design framework for PCS with varying densities and multiple microstructures. Initially, components topology optimization (TO-Components) using ordered SIMP interpolation is applied to determine the type and density distribution of void, solid and porous materials. Following this, element stress state analysis calculates the stress-to-density ratio ( s e ) for each porous material element. A two-level k-means++ clustering method, based on s e and density, then replaces the widely used manual partitioning, enabling optimal subregion division for the specified number of microstructure types. This approach identifies representative unit cells (RUCs) for the subsequent topology optimization of RUCs (TO-RUCs). The TO-RUCs process designs the microstructures of each RUC using homogenization theory to minimize strain energy. Three benchmark numerical examples take only 1 to 2 min to complete the full-scale design. Additionally, the scalability of the design for both uniform and variable density PCS is explored. The comparison examples demonstrate that the proposed method reduces optimization time by an order of magnitude while maintaining consistent full-scale compliance, using the same material quantity, compared to existing methods. Finally, additive manufacturing and mechanical testing of the optimized structures confirm the performance benefits.},

The added edges make however the VE unstable and a new procedure for the stabilization of initially stable VE is developed. The method is formulated within a recently proposed Hu–Washizu variational framework, allowing for a higher order, independent modeling of stresses.

Current simulation techniques face challenges in capturing the multiscale dynamics of polymer systems and are often limited by computational inefficiencies. Our approach combines a phase-field model with FSM for spatial discretization and leverages a PD-based diffusion operator to overcome the stability restrictions of explicit time-stepping schemes. This integration allows for larger time steps, ensuring both stability and computational efficiency. The method’s scalability is enhanced through parallel implementation using C++ and OpenMP, optimized for multi-core CPUs. Validation through phase diagrams of copolymer melts and simulations of evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) processes demonstrates the capability of the proposed method to accurately capture large-scale, dynamic morphologies. Our approach provides a versatile framework and was found in certain examples to improve computational efficiency by more than a factor of 6 compared to forward-Euler FSM approach.},

  abstract     = {Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress, stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics) in hyperelastic, two-dimensional, microporous materials. Predicting these pattern transformations means predicting the displacement field. To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E ( n ) -equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E ( n ) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, we introduce a varying-order (VO) NURBS discretization method to enhance the performance of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) technique for solving three-dimensional (3D) large deformation frictional contact problems involving two deformable bodies. Building on the promising results obtained from the previous work on the 2D isogeometric contact analysis (Agrawal and Gautam, 2020), this work extends the method’s capability for tri-variate NURBS-based discretization. The proposed method allows for independent, user-defined application of higher-order NURBS functions to discretize the contact surface while employing the minimum order NURBS for the remaining volume of the elastic solid. This flexible strategy enables the possibility to refine a NURBS-constructed solid at a fixed mesh with the controllable order elevation-based approach while preserving the original volume parametrization. The advantages of the method are twofold. First, employing higher-order NURBS for contact integral evaluations considerably enhances the accuracy of the contact responses at a fixed mesh, fully exploiting the advantage of higher-order NURBS specifically for contact computations. Second, the minimum order NURBS for the computations in the remaining bulk volume substantially reduces the computational cost inherently associated with the standard uniform order NURBS-based isogeometric contact analyses. The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated using various contact problems between elastic solids with or without considering friction. The results with the standard uniform order of tri-variate NURBS-based discretizations are also included to provide a comprehensive comparative assessment. We show that to attain results of similar accuracy, the varying-order NURBS discretization uses a much coarser mesh resolution than the standard uniform-order NURBS-based discretization, hence leading to a major gain in computational efficiency for isogeometric contact analysis. The convergence study demonstrates the consistent performance of the method for efficient IGA of 3D frictional contact problems. Furthermore, the simplicity of the method facilitates its direct integration into the existing 3D NURBS-based IGA framework with only a few minor modifications.},

  abstract     = {This contribution investigates sources of insufficiencies observed with the Capriccio method for concurrent continuum-particle coupling using a novel comparison technique. This approach maps the deformation states of three-dimensional (3D) coupled domains into a concise one-dimensional (1D) representation, which allows for a separate evaluation of the domain strains in a unified representation, enabling facile comparisons of the domain states during deformation. For the investigation, we employ both a 1D coupled system resembling the most relevant features of the full 3D Capriccio method as well as a corresponding 3D setup. Our analysis explores interactions between different material models in finite element (FE) and molecular dynamics (MD) domains. Based on various load cases studied in the 1D setup, we identify a resistance of the coupling region to spatial movement as the fundamental cause of strain convergence problems when applying the staggered solution scheme. Using the developed mapping approach, examination of the corresponding 3D setup reveals that these strain inconsistencies are even exacerbated by adverse relaxation effects in viscous MD models, particularly when coupled to a corresponding viscoelastic–viscoplastic FE model, leading to divergence from optimal strain. Our findings confirm that smaller strain increments in combination with larger load step numbers significantly improve strain convergence in all domains. Overall, this indicates the need for detailed sensitivity analysis of coupling parameter influences to reduce the identified motion resistance of the coupling region. Based on promising results in 1D, we further recommend exploring monolithic solving schemes for 3D systems to achieve optimal strain convergence for all types of Capriccio-based coupled particle and continuum material models. Moreover, our systematic approach of system definition and interdimensional comparison may serve as a model to assess other domain-decomposition coupling techniques.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the discrete nature of solid structures is crucial, particularly in situations where system behavior relies on material discontinuities, such as fracture and wear, along with their subsequent effects. It is not only essential to investigate when failure or discontinuity occurs within a material, but also how it unfolds and impacts its surroundings. While numerical methods serve as effective tools for analyzing structural behavior, continuum-based approaches may not provide a comprehensive view when dealing with discontinuities in a material. Discrete models provide the capability to simulate these discontinuities by bonding discrete elements (particles) together, thereby also simulating continuum behavior. However, the challenge lies in packing these particles within a complex-shaped structure. The dynamic packing approach excels in generating a tightly packed, randomly arranged bonded-particle structure with consistent mechanical behavior. However, it struggles when it comes to generating complex geometries. Conversely, the geometric approach is proficient at generating complex structures but lacks the reliability needed to simulate engineering materials. The method outlined in this paper represents the first attempt to dynamically pack particles within a complex geometry while maintaining all the necessary mechanical properties to accurately model isotropic engineering materials. Such precision in structure and methodology is vital for calibrating the bonds, ensuring that the bonded-particle structure behaves similarly to real materials. As an example, several bonded-particle structures are generated and tested to demonstrate the complexity of their shapes and their realistic mechanical behavior.},
