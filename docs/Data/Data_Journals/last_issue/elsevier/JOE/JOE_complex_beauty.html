  abstract     = {In asset pricing models with stochastic volatility, uncertainty about volatility affects risk premia through two channels: aversion to decreasing returns and aversion to increasing volatility. We analyze the identification of and robust inference for structural parameters measuring investors’ aversions to these risks: the return risk price and the volatility risk price. In the presence of a leverage effect (instantaneous causality between the asset return and its volatility), we study the identification of both structural parameters with the price data only, without relying on additional option pricing models or option data. We analyze this identification challenge in a nonparametric discrete-time exponentially affine model, complementing the continuous-time approach of Bandi and Renò (2016). We then specialize to a parametric model and derive the implied minimum distance criterion relating the risk prices to the asset return and volatility’s joint distribution. This criterion is almost flat when the leverage effect is small, and we introduce identification-robust confidence sets for both risk prices regardless of the magnitude of the leverage effect.},

First, we show that this problem can be transformed into a linear equation involving operators for which, under suitable regularity assumptions, least squares solutions are available. We then propose the use of the least squares solution with the minimum Hilbert–Schmidt norm, which, in our context, can be structurally interpreted as the solution with minimum dependence between Y and Z . Interestingly, in the case where the conditioning variable W is discrete and belongs to a finite set, such as the labels of units/groups/cities, the solution of this minimal dependence has a closed form. In the more general case, we use a regularization scheme and show the convergence of our proposed estimator. A numerical evaluation of our procedure is proposed.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the null hypothesis of weak identification is rejected, Wald-based inference can be carried out using standard formulas and critical values. A Monte Carlo study compares our proposed testing approach against commonly applied weak identification tests. The results simultaneously demonstrate the good performance of our approach and the fundamental failure of using conventional weak identification tests for linear models in the discrete choice model context.

They also provide decompositions of their variances and betas in terms of scale-specific variances and betas capturing predictive variability and co-variability over cycles of alternative lengths without spillovers across cycles. Making use of the proposed representations within the classical family of time-varying conditional volatility models, we document the role of time-varying volatility forecasts in generating orthogonal predictive scale-specific cycles in returns. We conclude by providing suggestive evidence that the conditional variances of the predictive return cycles ( i ) may be priced over short-to-medium horizons and ( i i ) may offer economically-relevant trading signals over these same horizons.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides new insights on exogeneity tests in linear IV models and their use for estimation, when identification fails or may not be strong. We make two main contributions. First , we show that Durbin–Wu–Hausman (DWH) and Revankar–Hartley (RH) exogeneity tests have correct level asymptotically, even when the first-stage coefficient matrix (which controls identification) is rank-deficient. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which these tests are consistent. In particular, we show that test consistency can hold even when identification fails, provided at least one component of the structural parameter vector is identifiable. Second , we study point estimation after estimator (or model) selection, when the outcome of a DWH/RH test determines whether OLS or an IV method is employed in the second-stage. For this purpose, we use ( non-local ) concepts of asymptotic bias , asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE), and asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE), which remain applicable even when the estimators considered do not have moments (as can happen for 2SLS) or may be inconsistent. We study the asymptotic properties of OLS, 2SLS, and pretest estimators which select OLS or 2SLS based on the outcome of a DWH/RH test. We show that: (i) OLS typically dominates 2SLS estimator asymptotically for MSE across a broad spectrum of cases, including weak identification and moderate endogeneity; (ii) exogeneity-pretest estimators exhibit consistently good performance and asymptotically dominate both OLS and 2SLS. The proposed theoretical findings are documented by Monte Carlo simulations.},

Our estimator is easy to implement and allows us to exploit all the informational content of a large number of auxiliary statistics without having to, (i) know these functions explicitly, or (ii) choose a priori which functions are the most informative. As a result, we are able to exploit, among other things, long-run information.

The framework allows for the presence of heavy tails and multivariate GARCH-type effects of unknown form among the stock returns.

This adaptive thresholding is achieved through sign-based Monte Carlo resampling within multiple testing procedures, controlling either the traditional familywise error rate, a generalized familywise error rate, or the false discovery proportion. Subsequent shrinkage ensures that the final covariance matrix estimate is positive definite and well-conditioned while preserving the achieved sparsity. Compared to alternative estimators, this new regularization method demonstrates strong performance in simulation experiments and real portfolio optimization.},

We extend the subset (factor) Anderson–Rubin test from Guggenberger et al. (2012) to models with multiple dynamic factors and time-varying risk prices. It provides a computationally tractable manner to conduct identification robust tests on a few risk premia when a larger number is present.

  abstract     = {Moment condition models with mixed identification strength are models that are point identified but with estimating moment functions that are allowed to drift to 0 uniformly over the parameter space. Even though identification fails in the limit, depending on how slow the moment functions vanish, consistent estimation is possible. Existing estimators such as the generalized method of moment (GMM) estimator exhibit a pattern of nonstandard or even heterogeneous rate of convergence that materializes by some parameter directions being estimated at a slower rate than others. This paper derives asymptotic semiparametric efficiency bounds for regular estimators of parameters of these models. We show that GMM estimators are regular and that the so-called two-step GMM estimator – using the inverse of estimating function’s variance as weighting matrix – is semiparametrically efficient as it reaches the minimum variance attainable by regular estimators. This estimator is also asymptotically minimax efficient with respect to a large family of loss functions. Monte Carlo simulations are provided that confirm these results.},

  abstract     = {Testing normality against discrete normal mixtures is complex because some parameters turn increasingly underidentified along alternative ways of approaching the null, others are inequality constrained, and several higher-order derivatives become identically 0. These problems make the maximum of the alternative model log-likelihood function numerically unreliable. We propose score-type tests asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio as the largest of two simple intuitive statistics that only require estimation under the null. One novelty of our approach is that we treat symmetrically both ways of writing the null hypothesis without excluding any region of the parameter space. We derive the asymptotic distribution of our tests under the null and sequences of local alternatives. We also show that their asymptotic distribution is the same whether applied to observations or standardized residuals from heteroskedastic regression models. Finally, we study their power in simulations and apply them to the residuals of Mincer earnings functions.},

  abstract     = {We analyze an environment where the uncertainty in the equity market return and its volatility are both stochastic and may be potentially disconnected. We solve a representative investor’s optimal asset allocation and derive the resulting conditional equity premium and risk-free rate in equilibrium. Our empirical analysis shows that the equity premium appears to be earned for facing uncertainty, especially high uncertainty that is disconnected from lower volatility, rather than for facing volatility as traditionally assumed. Incorporating the possibility of a disconnect between volatility and uncertainty significantly improves portfolio performance, over and above the performance obtained by conditioning on volatility only.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new macro-finance model that solves the tension between tractability, flexibility in macroeconomic dynamics, and consistency of the term structures of treasury yields with the effective lower bound (ELB). I use the term structures of U.S. nominal and real treasury yields from 1990 to explore the interdependence between inflation expectations, volatility, and monetary policy at the ELB. The estimation reveals that real yields stay elevated during the ELB due to large premia and deflation fears, produced by a persistent shift in inflation dynamics, with low average inflation and heightened inflation volatility.},
