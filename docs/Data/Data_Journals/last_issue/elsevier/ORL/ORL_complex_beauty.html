Such inequalities impose the minimum number of vehicles required to service each and every subset of customers, be it a fractional or an integer value. In case of the Heterogeneous version of the routing problem (HCVRP), the minimum number of vehicles required for a subset of customers is not defined uniquely: it depends on the vehicle types and fleet composition that was engaged in serving the customers. This paper revises existing literature on the capacity-based valid inequalities for the HCVRP and presents new routines to separate them exactly using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). In addition, this paper proposes a new family of capacity-based valid inequalities for the HCVRP together with an exact routine to separate them. A computational study demonstrates applicability of considered inequalities in solving HCVRP instances using a standard MILP solver.},
