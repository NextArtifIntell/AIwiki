  abstract     = {In order to provide a more effective method to describe the local structure of the degraded image and to enhance the robustness of the denoising, we propose a non-convex total variational image denoising model that combines the non-convex log function with an adaptive weighted matrix within the total variation framework. In the proposed model, the weighted matrix is capable of effectively describing the primary direction of the edge structure, based on the coupling of the gradient operator of the denoising image and the diagonal matrix. As the proposed model is a non-convex and non-smooth optimisation problem, the iterative reweighted ℓ 1 algorithm and alternating direction multiplier method are employed to decompose it into a number of readily solvable sub-problems. The results obtained from numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of effectively suppressing the noise while maintaining the local structure of the image.},

  abstract     = {Fast and accurate predictions of the spatiotemporal distributions of temperature are crucial to the multi-scale thermal management and safe operation of microelectronic devices. To realize it, an efficient semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme is developed for numerically solving the transient phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) from the ballistic to diffusive regime. The biggest innovation of the present scheme is that the finite difference method is used to solve the phonon BTE for the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function at the half-time step, where the second-order numerical schemes are used for both the temporal and spatial discretization. Consequently, the phonon scattering and migration are coupled together within one time step, and the evolution process of phonon distribution function follows the actual physical law even if the time step is much longer than the relaxation time. Numerical results show that the present scheme could accurately predict the steady/unsteady heat conduction in solid materials from the ballistic to diffusive regime, and its time step or cell size is not limited by the relaxation time or phonon mean free path. The present work could provide a useful tool for the efficient predictions of the macroscopic spatiotemporal distributions in the multi-scale thermal engineering.},

  abstract     = {The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for compressible flow is characterized by good numerical stability and low dissipation, while the conventional finite volume solvers have intrinsic conversation and flexibility in using unstructured meshes for complex geometries. This paper proposes a strategy to combine the advantages of the two kinds of solvers by designing a finite volume solver to mimic the LBM algorithm. It assumes an ideal LBM that can recover all desired higher-order moments. Time-discretized moment equations with second-order temporal accuracy and physically consistent dissipation terms are derived from the ideal LBM. By solving the recovered moment equations, a finite volume solver that can be applied to nonuniform meshes naturally, enabling body-fitted mass-conserving simulations, is proposed. Numerical tests show that the proposed solver can achieve good numerical stability from subsonic to hypersonic flows, and low dissipation for a long-distance entropy spot convection. For the challenging direct simulations of acoustic waves, its dissipation can be significantly reduced compared with the Lax-Wendroff solver of the same second-order spatial and temporal accuracy, while only remaining higher than that of the LBM on coarse meshes. The analysis implies that approximations of third-order temporal accuracy are required to recover the low dissipation of LBM further.},

  abstract     = {In this research article, we have simulated the solutions of three types of (classical) moving boundary models in ductal carcinoma in situ by an efficient temporal-spatial spectral collocation method. In all of these three classical models, the associated fixed (spatial) boundary equations are localized by the numerical scheme. In the numerical scheme, Laguerre polynomials and Hermite polynomials are implemented to approximate the temporal and spatial variables (of unknown solutions), respectively. Then, as a generalization of the first classical model, we have considered a space-fractional moving boundary model and then transformed it, again, to the corresponding fixed boundary space-fractional equation for a straightforward discretization. Due to the impossibility of transforming of the time-fractional moving boundary model into its fixed boundary variant, we localized the time-fractional moving boundary model directly by the proposed method. The results in this category are also very satisfactory and the accuracy is again in a spectral rate. Moreover, (temporal) multi-step version of our method is applied for the considered models and the results are very accurate with respect to the single-step one, especially when the boundary of tumor is diverging in practice. In this regard, an adaptive strategy is connected to the temporal multi-step approach for a better simulation. Extensive test problems are provided to verify the accuracy of the method, with full consideration given to iterative tools for solving the final system of nonlinear algebraic equations.},

  abstract     = {We consider the coupled system of the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation and the conservation of linear momentum law to describe magnetic processes in ferromagnetic materials including magnetoelastic effects in the small-strain regime. For this nonlinear system of time-dependent partial differential equations, we present a decoupled integrator based on first-order finite elements in space and an implicit one-step method in time. We prove unconditional convergence of the sequence of discrete approximations towards a weak solution of the system as the mesh size and the time-step size go to zero. Compared to previous numerical works on this problem, for our method, we prove a discrete energy law that mimics that of the continuous problem and, passing to the limit, yields an energy inequality satisfied by weak solutions. Moreover, our method does not employ a nodal projection to impose the unit length constraint on the discrete magnetisation, so that the stability of the method does not require weakly acute meshes. Furthermore, our integrator and its analysis hold for a more general setting, including body forces and traction, as well as a more general representation of the magnetostrain. Numerical experiments underpin the theory and showcase the applicability of the scheme for the simulation of the dynamical processes involving magnetoelastic materials at submicrometer length scales.},
