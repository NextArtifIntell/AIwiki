  abstract     = {In this article, we study a common break point in means for panel data with cross-sectional dependence through unobservable common factors, in which the observations are long-range dependent over time and are heteroscedastic and may have different degrees of dependence across panels. First, we adopt the least squares method without taking the data features into account to estimate the common break point and to see how the data features affect the asymptotic behaviors of the estimator. Then, an iterative least squares estimator of the common break point which accounts for the common factors in the estimation procedure is examined. Our theoretical results reveal that: (1) There is a trade-off between the overall break magnitude of the panel data and the long-range dependence for both estimators. (2) The second estimation procedure can eliminate the effects of common factors from the asymptotic behaviors of the estimator successfully, but it cannot improve the rate of convergence of the estimator in most cases. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results on finite-sample performance.},

  abstract     = {This article tackles the modeling challenge of bounded ℤ -valued time series by proposing a novel trinomial difference autoregressive process. This process not only maintains the autocorrelation structure presenting in the classical binomial GARCH model, but also facilitates the analysis of bounded ℤ -valued time series with negative or positive correlation. We verify the stationarity and ergodicity of the couple process (comprising both the observed process and its conditional mean process) while also presenting several stochastic properties. We further discuss the conditional maximum likelihood estimation and establish their asymptotic properties. The effectiveness of these estimators is assessed through simulation studies, followed by the application of the proposed models to two real datasets.},

  abstract     = {The article will focus on vector autoregressive-moving average (VARMA) models with time-dependent coefficients (td) to represent general nonstationary time series, not necessarily Gaussian. The coefficients depend on time, possibly on the length of the series n , hence the name tdVARMA ( n ) for the models, but not necessarily on the rescaled time t / n . As a consequence of the dependency on n of the model, we need to consider array processes instead of stochastic processes. Under appropriate assumptions, it is shown that a Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is consistent in probability and asymptotically normal. The theoretical results are illustrated using three examples of bivariate processes, the first two with marginal heteroscedasticity. The first example is a tdVAR ( n ) (1) process while the second example is a tdVMA ( n ) (1) process. In these two cases, the finite-sample behavior is checked via a Monte Carlo simulation study. The results are compatible with the asymptotic properties even for small . A third example shows the application of the tdVARMA models for a real time series.},

  abstract     = {How many factors are there? It is a critical question that researchers and practitioners deal with when estimating factor models. We proposed a new eigenvalue ratio criterion for the number of factors in static approximate factor models. It considers a pooled squared correlation matrix which is defined as a weighted combination of the main observed squared correlation matrices. Theoretical results are given to justify the expected good properties of the criterion, and a Monte Carlo study shows its good finite sample performance in different scenarios, depending on the idiosyncratic error structure and factor strength. We conclude comparing different criteria in a forecasting exercise with macroeconomic data.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the consequences of using Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA) to construct a time series bootstrap. The bootstrap replications are obtained via a SSA decomposition obtained using rescaled trajectories (RT-SSA), a procedure that is particularly useful in the analysis of time series that exhibit nonlinear, non-stationary and intermittent or transient behaviour. The theoretical validity of the RT-SSA bootstrap when used to approximate the sampling properties of a general class of statistics is established under regularity conditions that encompass a very broad range of data generating processes. A smeared and a boosted version of the RT-SSA bootstrap are also presented. Practical implementation of the bootstrap is considered and the results are illustrated using stationary, non-stationary and irregular time series examples.},

The estimators are based on a kernel smoothed version of the generalized empirical likelihood and the generalized method of moments approaches. The article derives the asymptotic normality of both estimators and shows that the proposed local generalized empirical likelihood estimator is more efficient than the local generalized moment estimator unless a two-step procedure is used. The article also proposes novel tests for the correct specification of the considered model that are shown to have power against local alternatives and are consistent against fixed alternatives.

  abstract     = {This article deals with unit root issues in time series analysis. It has been known for a long time that unit root tests may be flawed when a series although stationary has a root close to unity. That motivated recent papers dedicated to autoregressive processes where the bridge between stability and instability is expressed by means of time-varying coefficients. The process we consider has a companion matrix A n with spectral radius ρ ⁡ ( A n ) &lt; 1 satisfying ρ ⁡ ( A n ) → 1 , a situation described as ‘nearly-unstable’. The question we investigate is: given an observed path supposed to come from a nearly unstable process, is it possible to test for the ‘extent of instability’, i.e. to test how close we are to the unit root? In this regard, we develop a strategy to evaluate and to test for : ‘ ’ against : ‘ ’ when lies in an inner -neighborhood of the unity, for some . Empirical evidence is given about the advantages of the flexibility induced by such a procedure compared to the common unit root tests. We also build a symmetric procedure for the usually left out situation where the dominant root lies around .},

The case of a single univariate time series is very well developed in the literature; and single multi-variate series (i.e., vector time series) though less well studied have also been developed. A class of matrix time series models is introduced for dealing with situations where there are multiple sets of multi-variate time series data. Explicit expressions for a matrix autoregressive model along with its cross-autocorrelation functions are derived. Stationarity conditions are also provided. Least squares estimators and maximum likelihood estimators of the model parameters and their asymptotic properties are derived. Results are illustrated through simulation studies and a real data application.},
