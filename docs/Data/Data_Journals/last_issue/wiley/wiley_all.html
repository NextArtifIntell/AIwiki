  abstract     = {Company earnings calls are pivotal events that offer crucial insights into a company&#39;s financial well-being and future outlook. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising avenue for automatically generating the initial draft of earnings call scripts, leveraging financial data and past examples. We evaluate two distinct methods: (1) few-shot learning prompt engineering with a large language model (LLM) and (2) fine-tuning a large language model on earnings call transcript data. Our findings indicate that both methods can produce coherent scripts encompassing key metrics, updates, and guidance. However, there are inherent trade-offs in comprehensiveness, potential hallucinations, writing style, ease of use, and cost. We discuss the pros and cons of each method to guide practitioners on effectively harnessing LLMs for earnings call script generation. Notably, we employ a human and two different LLMs to act as judges to compare the outcomes generated by the two approaches.},

  abstract     = {Modern large language models (LLMs) represent a paradigm shift in what can plausibly be expected of machine learning models. The fact that LLMs can effectively generate sensible answers to a diverse range of queries suggests that they would be useful in customer support applications. While powerful, LLMs have been observed to be prone to hallucination which unfortunately makes their near-term use in customer support applications challenging. To address this issue, we present a system that allows us to use an LLM to augment our customer support advocates by re-framing the language modeling task as a discriminative classification task. In this framing, we seek to present the Top-K best template responses for a customer support advocate to use when responding to a customer. We present the result of both offline and online experiments where we observed offline gains and statistically significant online lifts for our experimental system. Along the way, we present observed scaling curves for validation loss and Top-K accuracy, resulted from model parameter ablation studies. We close by discussing the space of trade-offs with respect to model size, latency, and accuracy as well as and suggesting future applications to explore.},

  abstract     = {Biological function often depends on complex mechanisms of a dynamic, time-variant nature. An example is certain bat species (horseshoe bats—Rhinolophidae) that use intricate pinna musculatures to execute a variety of pinna deformations. While prior work has indicated the potential significance of these motions for sensory information encoding, it remains unclear how the complex time-variant pinna geometries could be controlled to enhance sensory performance. To address this issue, this work has investigated deep neural network models as digital twins for biomimetic pinnae. The networks were trained to predict the acoustic impacts of the deformed pinna geometries. A total of three network architectures have been evaluated for this purpose using physical numerical simulations (boundary element method) as ground truth. The networks predicted the acoustic beampattern function from pinna shape or even directly from the states of actuators that were used to deform the pinna shapes in simulation. Inserting prior knowledge in the form of beam-shaped basis functions did not improve network performance. The ability of the networks to produce beampattern predictions with low computational effort (in about three milliseconds each) should lend itself readily to supporting learning methods such as deep reinforcement learning that require many such functional evaluations.},

Consequently, urban decision-makers prioritize the mitigation of congestion. This study delves into the efficacy of harnessing extensive data on urban traffic dynamics, coupled with comprehensive knowledge of road networks, to enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in forecasting traffic flux well in advance. Such forecasts hold promise for informing emission reduction measures, particularly those aligned with Low Emission Zone policies. The investigation centers on Valencia, leveraging its robust traffic sensor infrastructure, one of the most densely deployed worldwide, encompassing approximately 3500 sensors strategically positioned across the city. Employing historical data spanning 2016 and 2017, we undertake the task of training and characterizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network for the prediction of temporal traffic patterns. Our findings demonstrate the LSTM&#39;s efficacy in real-time forecasting of traffic flow evolution, facilitated by its ability to discern salient patterns within the dataset.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new approach to indoor positioning that utilises channel state information (CSI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to improve accuracy. The proposed method extracts the amplitude and phase differences of the subcarriers from the CSI data to create fingerprints. ML algorithms and network architecture are utilised to train the CSI data from two antennas, in the form of phase and amplitude. Experiments conducted in a standard indoor environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Fuzzy Deep Belief Network (DBN) has proved its efficiency in dealing with sentiment analysis and suitability for classifying unlabeled or semi-labeled data. Previous structures of deep belief networks are mostly made of traditional activation functions such as sigmoid. In this paper, a new activation function, which is referred to as hyperbolic secant function, is proposed. The new activation function not only solves gradient zeroing problem but also increases the accuracy and efficiency. Besides, extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed as the decision layer to increase the accuracy and improve the generalizability through solving gradient-based learning problem. The efficiency of the proposed method has been experimented on “IMDB” movie critic dataset, 20-newspaper dataset and Sentiment Analysis dataset. The results of the proposed method are more accurate and precise as compared with the previous approaches.},

  abstract     = {To efficiently capture, activate, and transform small molecules, metalloenzymes have evolved to integrate a well-organized pocket around the active metal center. Within this cavity, second coordination sphere functionalities are precisely positioned to optimize the rate, selectivity, and energy cost of catalytic reactions. Inspired by this strategy, an artificial distal pocket defined by a preorganized 3D strap is introduced on an iron-porphyrin catalyst ( sc-Fe ) for the CO 2 -to-CO electrocatalytic reduction. Combined electrochemical, kinetic, and computational studies demonstrate that the adequate positioning of a carboxylate/carboxylic group acting in synergy with a trapped water molecule within this distal pocket remarkably enhances the reaction turnover frequency (TOF) by four orders of magnitude compared to the perfluorinated iron-tetraphenylporphyrin catalyst ( F 20 Fe ) operating at a similar low overpotential. A proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is found to be the key process responsible for the unexpected protonation of the coordinating carboxylate, which, upon CO 2 insertion, shifts from the first to the second coordination sphere to play a possible secondary role as a proton relay.},

  abstract     = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dual role in wound healing. They act as crucial signaling molecules and antimicrobial agents when present at moderate levels. However, excessive levels of ROS can hinder the healing process for individuals with diabetes. As a result, targeting ROS levels to maintain redox balance has become a promising strategy for improving wound recovery. Currently, no biomaterials have been reported to simultaneously up-regulate and down-regulate ROS to achieve broad-spectrum antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Inspired by the site-dependent effect of nanomaterials, a micron-sized ferroferric oxide (Fe 3 O 4 )/MXene (FM) heterojunction is synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The FM heterojunction could scavenge extracellular ROS by activating catalase (CAT)-like and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like nanozyme activities. Meanwhile, FM heterojunction could release ferric ions and ferrous ions by defect engineering to induce bacterial ferroptosis, up-regulating intercellular ROS, and lipid peroxidation. For applications in vivo, FM heterojunction is incorporated into the tips of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based microneedle (termed as GFM microneedle) using a two-step casting technique. The results showed that GFM microneedle combined with photothermal therapy could improve S. aureus -infected skin regeneration in diabetic rats. The effectiveness and safety of GFM microneedle are not less favorable than that of a commercial wound dressing. This study provides a proof-of-concept for heterojunction-mediated regenerative medicine via a site-dependent ROS-targeting strategy.},

Diverse reducing agents for Li supplements, such as quinone molecules, have been considered to homogenize the Li distribution in the cathode materials obtained after cycling; however, the detailed reaction mechanism is still unknown. Herein, the ideal electrochemical potential factor and reaction mechanism of the redox mediator 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone (DTBQ) for the chemical relithiation of high-Ni-layered cathodes are elucidated. Here, 100% efficiency of DTBQ-assisted chemical relithiation is achieved by adjusting the direct immersion time of Li-deficient cathode electrodes. The reversible reaction features of the physical and chemical structures of both the regenerated cathodes and the DTBQ molecules are investigated using advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations. These findings emphasize the potential of redox-mediator-assisted chemical relithiation for realizing direct recycling processes and offer a facile and sustainable solution for battery recycling.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous clusters are gaining prominence as prospective hosts for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs), but their efficacy is still affected by atomic coordination. Optimization of ion storage and charge transport can be achieved through high coordination and bimetallic configurations. Herein, high-coordination amorphous P 6 -Nb-W-P 5 (Nb/W-P) clusters are skillfully tailored by bridging Nb into the second shell of W in the W-P 5 configuration, nested in situ in conductive and stable N, P co-doped carbon nanospheres (Nb/W-P@NPC). Such clusters with high atom utilization can offer profuse Na + storage sites due to their high coordination. As an electron donor, Nb-bridging can subtly modify the electronic structure of clusters, and broaden the hybridization of d-p orbitals, thus improving charge transfer efficiency and fostering diversified active sites. Compared with the low-coordinated W-P L @NPC and the high-coordinated W-P@NPC, the reversible capacity of Nb/W-P@NPC upgrades to 556.3 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 , alongside exceptional cycling stability at high rates. When integrated into SIHCs, the high energy density and high-power output (223.6 and 9800 W kg −1 ) are achieved. By systematically exploring the effect of high coordination and bimetallic design on the storage efficacies of amorphous clusters, this study has greatly advanced the development of SIHC technologies.},

Here, the development of a barcode-indexed PCR coupled with HiFi long-read sequencing pipeline (BIP-seq) is reported for high throughput Protein Protein Interaction (PPI)identification. BIP-seq is essentially built on the integration of library versus library Y2H mating strategy to facilitate the efficient acquisition of random PPI colonies, semi-mechanized dual barcode-indexed yeast colony PCR for the large-scale indexed amplification of bait and prey cDNAs, and massive pac-bio sequencing of PCR amplicon pools. It is demonstrated that BIP-seq could map over 15 000 high-confidence (≈62.5% could be verified by Bimolecular fluorescence Complementation (BiFC)) rice PPIs within 2 months, outperforming the other reported methods. In addition, the obtained 23 032 rice PPIs, including 22,665 newly identified PPIs, greatly expanded the current rice PPI dataset, provided a comprehensive overview of the rice PPIs networks, and could be a valuable asset in facilitating functional genomics research in rice.},

Lung endothelial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme of the carnitine shuttle system, is reduced in a rodent model of BPD. It is unknown whether endothelial Cpt1a reduction causes pulmonary vascular (PV) remodeling. The latter can be the result of endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Here, endothelial cell (EC)-specific Cpt1a KO and WT mice (&lt;12 h old) are exposed to hyperoxia (70% O 2 ) for 14 days and allow them to recover in normoxia until postnatal day 28. Hyperoxia causes PH, which is aggravated in EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice. Upregulating endothelial Cpt1a expression inhibits hyperoxia-induced PV remodeling. Hyperoxia causes lung EndoMT, detected by immunofluorescence, scRNA-sequencing, and EC lineage tracing, which is further increased in EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice. Blocking EndoMT inhibits hyperoxia-induced PV remodeling. Male mice under the same high oxygen conditions develop a higher degree of PH than females, which is associated with reduced endothelial Cpt1a expression. Conclusively, neonatal hyperoxia causes PH by decreasing endothelial Cpt1a expression and upregulating EndoMT. This provides a valuable strategy for developing targeted therapies by upregulating endothelial Cpt1a levels or inhibiting EndoMT to treat BPD-associated PH.},

Compared to stem cell implantation, recruitment of endogenous stem cells to injured sites is more critical for in situ bone regeneration. In this study, based on the acidic microenvironment of bone injury, an HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel with a dual-control intelligent switch function is developed by incorporating stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1α), arginine carbon dots (Arg-CDs), and calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) into the oxidized hyaluronic acid/gelatin methacryloyl (HG) hydrogel. The acidic microenvironment triggers the first switch (Schiff base bond is broken between HG-AA 1:1 and SDF-1α) of HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel to continuously release SDF-1α. Compared to the neutral (pH 7.4) media, the cumulative release of SDF-1α in acidic (pH 5.5) media is ≈2.5 times higher, which enhances the migration and recruitment of endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The recruited MSCs immediately initiate the second switch and metabolize Arg-CDs into the bioactive nitric oxide (NO) in the presence of Ca 2+ , activating NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, the engineered HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel shows promising potential to achieve “coupling osteogenesis and angiogenesis” for bone regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-performance dielectric materials remains a significant challenge due to the inherent trade-offs between high energy storage density and low energy loss. A central difficulty lies in identifying a suitable dipolar unit that can enhance the polarity and dielectric constant of the material while effectively suppressing the high energy losses associated with polarization relaxation, charge injection, and conduction. To address this, a novel strategy is proposed that introduces electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents on the benzene ring of polystyrene-based polymers, creating bulky dipole groups that are resistant to reorientation under an electric field. This approach mitigates relaxation losses associated with dipole reorientation and manipulates the band structure via substituent modification to suppress conduction losses. Additionally, the deformation of the π -electron cloud under an electric field enhances the dielectric constant and energy storage density. Ultimately, the optimized chlorostyrene-methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymer exhibits an 85% discharge efficiency and an energy storage density of 18.3 J cm − 3 , nearly three times that of styrene-based copolymers under the same conditions. This study introduces a new approach for designing high-energy density, low-loss polymer dielectric materials by precisely controlling electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects to modulate the distribution of π -conjugated electron clouds.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen usually exists in the form of diatomic molecules at ambient conditions. At high pressure, it undergoes a series of phase transitions from diatomic O 2 to O 8 cluster and ultimately dissociates into a polymeric O 4 spiral chain structure. Intriguingly, the commonly found cyclic hexameric molecules in other group VIA elements (e.g., S 6 and Se 6 ) are never reported in the bulk oxygen. Through extensive computational crystal structure search, herein it is reported that such hexameric O 6 molecules can exist in a stable compound HeO 3 above 1.9 TPa. The first-principles calculations reveal that, during the reaction by mixing oxygen with helium, the insertion of helium does not only expand the lattice volume, but also relieves the electron lone pair repulsion among diatomic O 2 , and thus significantly promoting the formation of cyclic O 6 molecules. Furthermore, the transition pathway calculations demonstrate that molecular O 2 is dissociated first, and then six oxygen atoms form a polymeric digital 2-shaped intermediate O 6 . Subsequently, each unstable intermediate O 6 decomposes into two intermedia O 3 trimers. Finally, O 3 trimers transform into cyclic O 6 molecules at high pressure. This study expands the known molecular forms of oxygen and suggests a route to the synthesis of intriguing cyclic O 6 molecules.},

  abstract     = {The wetting and spreading behaviors of metal droplets on solid substrates are critical aspects of additive manufacturing. However, the inherent characteristics of metal droplets, including high surface tension, elevated viscosity, and extreme temperatures, pose significant challenges for wetting and spreading on nonwetting substrates. Herein, this work proposes a strategy that employs a two-dimensional (2D) orthogonal ultrasonic field to construct a vibration deposition substrate with radial vibration amplitude gradient, thereby enhancing the wettability and adhesive strength of impacting metal droplets ejected by a piezoelectric micro-jet device. First, a 2D ultrasonic vibration device is designed based on the combination of longitudinal vibration modes. Additionally, oblique and circular vibration trajectories are synthesized. The vibration amplitude distributions and trajectories of the deposition substrate are verified utilizing the finite element method. Subsequently, the experimental results demonstrate that the contact angle is decreased by 24.7%, the spreading diameter is increased by 10.3%, and the adhesive strength is enhanced by 5.4 times compared to deposition on a static substrate. The 2D ultrasonic field facilitates the transition of metal droplets from a non-wetting state to a wetting state on the nonwetting substrate, which highlights the versatility and adaptability of ultrasonic strategy for expanding the applications of metal droplets.},

To investigate this phenomenon, a microfluidic platform is constructed for profiling immune-cancer cell interactions at the single-cell proteomics level for the first time. Based on the platform, a comprehensive workflow is proposed for achieving accurate single-cell pairing of an immune cell and a cancer cell with low cell damage and high success rate up to 95%, cell pair co-culture, and real-time microscopic monitoring of the cell-pair interactions, cell pair retrieval, mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of singe cell pairs, and decoupling of the proteomic information for each cell within the cell pair with the stable-isotope labeling method. With the workflow, the interactions of single natural killer (NK) cells and single K562 tumor cells are investigated based on real-time images and single cell-pair proteomics. Notably, an identification depth of over 1000 protein groups in a single cell-pair is achieved, leading to the discovery of sub-clusters of NK cells with different functions and the identification of important biomarkers for cancer treatments. This demonstrates the unique capability of the present platform in providing substantial and comprehensive datasets for profiling immune-cancer cell interactions, discovering heterogeneous immune responses, and predicting biomarkers in the study of cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Graves&#39; disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder with a high incidence rate, particularly affecting women of reproductive age. Current treatment modalities for GD carry significant disadvantages, especially for pregnant or nursing women. As a novel extracorporeal therapeutic technique, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) shows great promise for treating GD; however, its low treatment efficacy impedes clinical application. In this study, a thyroid-targeted nano-bomb system (PD-PLGA@Si-Ab/PDA-I, PSAPI) is developed to enhance HIFU efficacy and improve therapeutic outcomes for GD. The core structure of PSAPI encapsulates a phase-transition material, perfluorohexane, and the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac within a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and silica shell. A polydopamine coating enhances biocompatibility, while iodine loading and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies grafting ensure targeted delivery to the thyroid. Robust in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that PSAPI is highly biocompatible, accumulates in the thyroid within 24 h after administration, and significantly potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of HIFU, resulting in markedly reduced inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a cellular defense mechanism activated in PSAPI-treated cells following HIFU irradiation, highlighting potential molecular targets for the future development of HIFU-sensitizing agents. The biocompatible PSAPI nano-bomb developed in this study holds great transformative potential, addressing critical gaps in current therapeutic practices for GD.},

The peak aggregation of nanoprobes in the MIRI region is monitored by near-infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. The maximal fluorescence and photoacoustic signals of the HI@PSeP-IMTP group in the MIRI region rise ≈32% and 40% respectively compared with that of HI@PSeP group. Moreover, HI@PSeP-IMTP effectively mitigates MIRI due to a synergistic integration of diselenide bonds and hesperadin, which can eliminate ROS and suppress cardiac inflammation. Specifically, the expression levels of p-CaMKII, p-IκBα, and p65 in the MIRI region in the HI@PSeP-IMTP group demonstrate a reduction of 30%, 46%, and 42% respectively compared to that of the PBS group.

  abstract     = {In the search for new ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, two novel cadmium mixed halide compounds, (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Cl 3 F 3 and (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 , are successfully synthesized via hydrothermal methods. These compounds crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) space group, R 32, and are composed of distorted octahedral [CdX 3 F 3 ] (X═Cl or Br) units, which extend into a 3D framework. Remarkably, both compounds demonstrate strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) efficiencies—3.0 and 8.0 times that of KH 2 PO 4 for the Cl- and Br-containing analogs, respectively—with phase-matching behavior observed. The SHG efficiency is attributed to the highly distorted coordination environment of the polarizable d 10 Cd 2+ ions, with (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 benefiting further from Br&#39;s greater polarizability. Furthermore, these compounds exhibit wide bandgaps exceeding 4.2 eV, making them the first d 10 metal mixed halide systems incorporating fluoride that are suitable for UV NLO applications. With UV absorption cut-off edges as short as 203 nm for (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Cl 3 F 3 and 243 nm for (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 , these materials represent a significant advancement in the development of UV-transparent NLO materials. This study introduces a novel synthetic strategy for the design of d 10 mixed halide systems with enhanced optical properties, offering promising candidates for future UV NLO technologies.},

Although various methods exist to adjust the polarization-sensitive photocurrent, a universal and effective approach for continuous control of MHPs’ optoelectronic and polarized properties is lacking. A universal strategy to electrically modulate the polarization ratio (PR) of self-powered polarized PDs using the ferro-pyro-phototronic effect (FPPE) in 2D perovskites is presented. By varying the amplitude and direction of ferroelectric polarization voltage, the built-in electric field in the heterojunction can be modulated, allowing for controllable PR regulation and adjustable polarization characteristics. Moreover, the polarized pyroelectric photoresponses are realized, significantly enhancing the responsivity, response speed of the polarized PDs. Both the pyroelectric currents and photocurrents exhibit obvious polarization characteristics. This method&#39;s versatility is demonstrated by creating three additional quasi-2D MHP ferroelectric-based polarized-sensitive PDs. A proof-of-concept for encrypted optical communication is achieved using the UV-sensitive PDs as light-sensing units. These findings highlight FPPE&#39;s potential to enhance ferroelectric device polarization control, enabling high-performance and self-powered polarization photodetection.},

  abstract     = {Lithium metal batteries are considered the holy grail for next-generation high-energy systems. However, lithium anode faces poor reversibility, unsatisfying cyclability and rate capability due to its uncontrollable plating/stripping behavior. While galvanostatic conditions are extensively studied, the behavior under more realistic application scenarios with variable inputs are less explored. Here, an in situ imaging platform using in-plane microdevice configurations is developed to effectively investigate Li plating/stripping behavior under dynamic conditions. This platform offers high detectivity for analyzing the nuclei size, density, distribution, and growth location, rate, and mode. It is for the first time revealed that nuclei density and growth locations remain constant and are solely determined by the initial nucleation overpotentials during dynamic plating. A transition in growth modes from uniform granular growth to tip-induced dendrite growth, and finally to directional growth among the dendrites is also observed. Guided by these findings, a dynamic plating protocol is proposed, which can greatly improve the Li reversibility and cycling stability. This work not only provides a novel approach to visualize the evolution of key nucleation and growth parameters, especially under variable inputs, but also offers valuable guidance for the future industrialization of metal batteries and the rational design of charging facilities.},

Biomimetic visual systems leverage biological synapse properties to improve memory encoding and perception. Optoelectronic devices mimicking these synapses can enhance wearable electronics, with layered heterojunction materials being ideal materials for optoelectronic synapses due to their tunable properties and biocompatibility. However, conventional synthesis methods are complex and environmentally harmful, leading to issues such as poor stability and low charge transfer efficiency. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a more efficient, convenient, and eco-friendly method for preparing layered heterojunction materials. Here, a one-step ultrasonic method is employed to mix fullerene (C60) with graphene oxide (GO), yielding a homogeneous layered heterojunction composite film via self-assembly. The biomimetic optoelectronic synapse based on this film achieves 97.3% accuracy in dynamic visual recognition tasks and exhibits capabilities such as synaptic plasticity. Experiments utilizing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier–transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms stable π-π interactions between GO and C60, facilitating electron transfer and prolonging carrier recombination times.

Here, the role of hyperlactatemia in hepatic IRI is explored. In this work, hyperlactatemia is found to exacerbate ferroptosis during hepatic IRI. Lactate-primed lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8) is determined to directly lactylate mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) at Lys100 and augments PCK2 kinase activity. By using gene-edited mice, evidence indicating that PCK2 exacerbates hepatic ferroptosis during IRI is generated. Mechanistically, PCK2 lactylate at Lys100 acts as a critical inducer of ferroptosis during IRI by competitively inhibiting the Parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (OXSM), thereby leading to metabolic remodeling of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) and the potentiation of oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. More importantly, targeting PCK2 is demonstrated to markedly ameliorate hyperlactatemia-mediated ferroptosis during hepatic IRI. Collectively, the findings support the use of therapeutics targeting PCK2 to suppress hepatic ferroptosis and IRI in patients with hyperlactatemia during LT.},

In this work, a small molecule acceptor, SC8-IT4F, is developed through outer side chain engineering on the terminal thiophene of a conjugated 6,12-dihydro-dithienoindeno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDTT) central core. Compared to the reference molecule C8-IT4F, which lacks outer side chains, SC8-IT4F displays notable differences in molecule geometry (as shown by simulations), thermal behavior, single-crystal packing, and film morphology. Blend films of SC8-IT4F and the polymer donor PM6 exhibit larger carrier mobilities, longer carrier lifetimes, and reduced recombination compared to C8-IT4F, resulting in improved device performance. Binary photovoltaic devices based on the PM6:SC8-IT4F films reveal an optimal efficiency over 15%, which is one of the best values for non-Y type small molecule acceptors (SMAs). The resultant devices also show better thermal and operational stability than the control PM6:L8-BO devices. SC8-IT4F and its blend exhibit a higher relative degree of crystallinity and π coherence length, compared to C8-IT4F samples, beneficial for charge transport and device performance. The results indicate that outer side chain engineering on existing small electron acceptors can be a promising molecular design strategy for further pursuing high-performance organic solar cells.},

To address this, the study has developed a soluble microneedles (MN) patch comprising poly(vinyl alcohol), cyclodextrin modified polyacrylic acid, and new indocyanine green. This innovative MN patch facilitates the transdermal release of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonists, such as rosiglitazone in response to near-infrared ray induced temperature changes. By safely optimizing temperature, the patch effectively liquefied meibum lips, thereby alleviating duct obstruction while releasing the drug. MN patches exhibit sufficient mechanical strength for effective skin penetration, and its biosafety for eyelid application has been rigorously assessed in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic efficiency of rosiglitazone loaded MN (ROSI-MN) treatment for MGD is evaluated in high-fat mice. After three months of treatments, ROSI-MN administration significantly alleviated MGD clinical manifestations, including ocular surface damage, lipid deposits, glandular hypertrophy, and inflammatory infiltration, ultimately improving the microstructure and biofunction of MGs. In conclusion, the soluble MN patches hold promise as an effective drug delivery strategy for treating ocular surface diseases beyond MGD.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial plant diseases, worsened by biofilm-mediated resistance, are increasingly threatening global food security. Numerous attempts have been made to develop agrochemicals that inhibit biofilms, however, their ineffective foliar deposition and difficulty in removing mature biofilms remain major challenges. Herein, multifunctional three-component supramolecular nano-biscuits (NI6R@CB[7]@ β -CD) are successfully engineered via ordered self-assembly between two macrocycles [cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), β -cyclodextrin ( β -CD)] and ( R )-2-naphthol-based bis-imidazolium bromide salt (NI6R). This macrocycles-involved bactericidal material combines many advantages. 1) Alleviate the off-target movement of droplets on hydrophobic blade surfaces. 2) Enhance the biofilm-disrupting ability. At a low-dose of 4.44 µg mL −1 , the inhibition rate of biofilm formation reached 78.3%. At 35.5 µg mL −1 , the potency to remove mature biofilms reached 77.6%. 3) Efficiently hinder bacterial reproduction, swimming, extracellular polysaccharide production, extracellular enzyme secretion, and virulence to plants. These superior characteristics are undoubtedly transmitted to the in vivo control effect. At 200 µg mL −1 , this smart material exhibits superior control efficiencies of 49.6%/65.0%/85.4% against three kinds of bacterial diseases (rice leaf blight, citrus canker, and kiwifruit canker), respectively, surpassing the commercial bactericide—thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (33.6%/41.5%/43.2%) and NI6R (40.3%/51.2%/71.2%). Furthermore, NI6R@CB[7]@ β -CD is biosafe to non-target organisms. This study is instructive for constructing multifunctional agrochemicals in sustainable crop protection.},

Multiple conductance states are achieved in α-In 2 Se 3 -based FeSFETs by controlling the ferroelectric polarization. The on/off current ratio (I on /I off ) is ≈10 5 with a dark current of ≈10 −11 A by applying a single positive gate voltage pulse.

Yet, little is known about the interactions between NPs and proteins, and its role in enhanced depth of serum proteomics. Herein, a series of protein spike-in experiments are conducted to systematically investigate protein depletion and enrichment during NPC formation. Proteomic depth is serum concentration-dependent, and NPC exhibits powerful tolerance to ultra-high abundant proteins. In addition, protein-protein interactions (PPI), especially those involving albumin, play a pivotal role in promoting proteomic depth. Furthermore, a triple-protein assay is established to interrogate the relationship between protein binding affinity and concentration. NPC formation is a product of balancing binding affinity, concentration, and PPI. Overall, this study elucidates how NPs achieve protein depletion and enrichment for enhanced serum proteomic depth to gain a better understanding of NPC as an essential tool of proteome profiling.},

  abstract     = {Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is the leading cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis worldwide. The neuroimmune interactions between peripheral and central immune systems in angiostrongyliasis remain unclear. In this study, significant infiltration of eosinophils, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and Ly6C monocytes is observed in the brains of AC-infected mice, with macrophages being the most abundant. RNA-seq and SMART-seq analysis of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and DNA sensor gene sets revealed a marked increase in Z-DNA binding protein 1 (Zbp1) expression in infected mice. Confocal microscopy, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry further confirmed that Zbp1 is specifically upregulated in macrophages and microglia. Using Zbp1-knockout mice and flow cytometry, it is found that knockout of Zbp1 enhanced lymphocyte infiltration and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, modulating the immune microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) during AC infection. Mechanistically, it is revealed that in macrophage Zbp1 directly binds to receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) to promote its phosphorylation, subsequently facilitating the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl). The activated Zbp1-pRIP3-pMlkl axis leads to necroptosis and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1α, CXCL9, CXCL10 in macrophages, which recruits and activates immune cells. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of angiostrongyliasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.},

Based on this, logical operations are performed by adjusting the power of the modulation light superimposed with the signal light. This facilitates more covert, all-optical, high-speed encrypted communication. The ultrahigh tunability and nearly symmetric positive and negative photoconductivity of all-optical modulation photodetectors significantly enhance the computational capacity of neuromorphic hardware. The proposed device exhibits substantial advantages in applications requiring high fault tolerance for integrated sensing-computing （ISC） and high-resolution motion object recognition, providing insights for the development of next-generation high-bandwidth, low-power-consumption ISC devices.},

However, predicting the epigenetic consequences of non-coding mutations at single-cell resolution remains a challenge. Existing tools have limited prediction capacity and struggle to capture dynamic, cell-type-specific regulatory changes that are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Here, Methven, a deep learning framework designed is presented to predict the effects of non-coding mutations on DNA methylation at single-cell resolution. Methven integrates DNA sequence with single-cell ATAC-seq data and models SNP-CpG interactions over 100 kbp genomic distances. By using a divide-and-conquer approach, Methven accurately predicts both short- and long-range regulatory interactions and leverages the pre-trained DNA language model for enhanced precision in classification and regression tasks. Methven outperforms existing methods and demonstrates robust generalizability to monocyte datasets. Importantly, it identifies CpG sites associated with rheumatoid arthritis, revealing key pathways involved in immune regulation and disease progression. Methven&#39;s ability to detect progressive epigenetic changes provides crucial insights into gene regulation in complex diseases. These findings demonstrate Methven&#39;s potential as a powerful tool for basic research and clinical applications, advancing this understanding of non-coding mutations and their role in disease, while offering new opportunities for personalized medicine.},

Nevertheless, achieving full-polarization, arbitrary amplitude, and phase modulation of radiation scattering remains a challenge. In this paper, a strategy that realizes space-time coding of radiation scattering within the same frequency band, which enables the simultaneous and independent modulation of amplitude and phase, is proposed. To address the limitations of the high sideband levels (SBLs) of conventional space-time-coding metasurfaces, a strategy comprising nonuniform modulation periods and stochastic coding is proposed. Consequently, beam scanning with ultra-low sidelobe levels (SLLs) and suppressed SBLs is achieved in the radiation mode (RM). In scattering mode (SM), in-band low scattering characteristics are achieved within the same operating frequency band as RM. A prototype of a space-time-coding radiation-scattering metasurface (STCRSM) is fabricated and the aforementioned functionalities are validated by measurements. Furthermore, the proposed strategy does not necessitate the utilization of optimization algorithms and exhibits low SLLs and low SBLs, which will make it flourish in RF stealth applications, such as covert communication systems.},

The electron–phonon coupling strength is enhanced in the perovskite self-assembled CsPbCl 3 MCs, which remarkably accelerates the PL decay of Mn 2+ ions in room temperature. Furthermore, the phonon-involved PL emission splits to two peaks at low temperature of 80 K, due to the phonon emission and absorption-induced energy exchange for exciton recombination in Mn 2+ ions.

  abstract     = {3D disordered fibrous network structures (3D-DFNS), such as cytoskeletons, collagen matrices, and spider webs, exhibit remarkable material efficiency, lightweight properties, and mechanical adaptability. Despite their widespread in nature, the integration into engineered materials is limited by the lack of study on their complex architectures. This study addresses the challenge by investigating the structure-property relationships and stability of biomimetic 3D-DFNS using large datasets generated through procedural modeling, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning. Based on these datasets, a network deep reinforcement learning (N-DRL) framework is developed to optimize its stability, effectively balancing weight reduction with the maintenance of structural integrity. The results reveal a pronounced correlation between the total fiber length in 3D-DFNS and its mechanical properties, where longer fibers enhance stress distribution and stability. Additionally, fiber orientation is also considered as a potential factor influencing stress growth values. Furthermore, the N-DRL model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional approaches in optimizing network stability while minimizing mass and computational cost. Structural integrity is significantly improved through the addition of triple junctions and the reduction of higher-order nodes. In summary, this study leverages machine learning to optimize biomimetic 3D-DFNS, providing novel insights into the design of lightweight, high-strength materials.},

  abstract     = {Liver disease poses a significant threat to global public health, with arsenic (As) recognized as a major environmental toxin contributing to liver injury. However, the specific mechanisms and the protective effects of α-lipoic acid (LA) remain unclear. Therefore, this study employs network toxicology and network pharmacology to comprehensively analyze the hepatotoxic mechanism of As and the hepatoprotective mechanism of LA, and further verifies the mechanisms of peroxisomal β-oxidation and lipophagy in the process. The network analysis results show that As induces liver damage mainly through autophagy, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress, whereas LA exerts its hepatoprotective properties mainly by regulating lipid metabolism. Further verifications find that As inhibits SIRT1 expression, activates the P53 and Notch pathways, damages mitochondria, inhibits peroxisomal β-oxidation, increases lipid accumulation, and enhances lipophagy in the liver, while LA intervention alleviates As-induced lipid accumulation and enhances lipophagy by targeting SIRT1, ameliorating mitochondrial damage, enhancing peroxisomal β-oxidation, thereby alleviating As-induced liver damage. This study further clarifies the mechanism of As hepatotoxicity and provides a theoretical basis for LA as a potential hepatoprotective agent.},

  abstract     = {Hispidin ( 1 ) is a polyphenolic compound with a wide range of pharmacological activities that is distributed in both plants and fungi. In addition to natural extraction, hispidin can be obtained by chemical or enzymatic synthesis. In this study, the identification and characterization of an undescribed enzyme, PheG, from Phellinus igniarius ( P. igniarius ), which catalyzes the construction of a key C─C bond in the enzymatic synthesis of hispidin are reported. It is demonstrated in vitro that PheG generates hispidin by catalyzing C─C bond formation in the aldol condensation reaction. Based on these results, a plausible pathway for hispidin biosynthesis is proposed by utilizing the primary triacetic acid lactone (TAL, 2 ) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde ( 3 ). The mechanisms for the aldol condensation reaction of PheG are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations, density functional theory, and site-specific mutations. The locations of the key amino acid residues that catalyze the conversion of substrates 2 and 3 to hispidin at the active site of PheG-1 are identified. This study provides a new method for preparing hispidin with high efficiency and low cost.},

Pq3-O-UGT2, an important UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT), catalyzes the production of Ginsenoside Rg3 and Rd by extending the glycan chain of Ginsenoside Rh2 and F2, respectively, with higher selectivity for F2. However, the mechanism underlying its substrate recognition remains unclear. In this study, the crystal structures of Pq3-O-UGT2 in complex with its acceptor substrates are solved. The structures revealed a Nα5-oriented acceptor binding pocket in Pq3-O-UGT2, shaped by the unique conformation of the Nα5-Nα6 linker. Hydrophobic interactions play a pivotal role in the recognition of both Rh2 and F2, while hydrogen bonds specifically aid in F2 recognition due to its additional glucose moiety. The hydrophobic nature of the acceptor binding pocket also enables Pq3-O-UGT2 to recognize flavonoids. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the substrate recognition mechanisms of ginsenoside UGTs, advancing the understanding of their function and specificity.},

A central component of this process is gut-derived metabolites, which play a crucial role in mediating the distal functioning of the microbiota. In this study, a comprehensive microbiome-metabolite analysis using fecal and serum samples from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and volunteers with risk factors for coronary heart disease and culture histology is performed, and identified the core strain Bacteroides ovatus ( B. ovatus ). Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments further demonstrated that the gut microbiota significantly influences AS progression, with B. ovatus alone exerting effects comparable to volunteer feces from volunteers. Notably, B. ovatus alleviated AS primarily by restoring the intestinal barrier and enhancing bile acid metabolism, particularly through the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a tryptophan-derived metabolite. IAA inhibited the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in M1 macrophages, promoted M2 macrophage polarisation, and restored the M1/M2 polarisation balance, ultimately reducing aortic inflammation. These findings clarify the mechanistic interplay between the gut microbiota and AS, providing the first evidence that B. ovatus , a second-generation probiotic, can improve bile acid metabolism and reduce inflammation, offering a theoretical foundation for future AS therapeutic applications involving this strain.},

Additionally, mitochondrial proteins have not previously been reported to be secreted into hosts by pathogens. Here, it is found that the Meloidogyne javanica elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu) (MjEF-Tu) located in the nematode mitochondria is up-regulated and secreted into the host plant during nematode parasitism. MjEF-Tu interacts with the PRR Arabidopsis thaliana EF-Tu receptor (AtEFR), triggering the plant hallmark defence responses mediated by AtEFR. An 18-aa sequence (Nelf18) in the N terminus of the nematode EF-Tu contributes to the immunogenic activity. M. javanica water extract and mitochondrial extract also induce plant immunity sensed by AtEFR, owing to the presence of MjEF-Tu. In addition, Nelf18 enhances plant resistance to nematode, virus, and bacterial infections depending on AtEFR. These findings first demonstrate that mitochondrial proteins from pathogens can be secreted into hosts and function as a cross-kingdom signal and identified the first plant-parasitic animal-derived proteinaceous PAMP/PRR pair, providing novel insights into host-pathogen interactions.},

Targeting ferroptosis regulation presents a promising therapeutic strategy for OA; however, current research primarily focuses on single targets associated with ferroptosis. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanoparticle is developed by linking deferasirox (DEF) and pterostilbene (PTE) with thioketal and incorporating cerium ions (Ce), creating Ce@D&amp;P nanoparticles (NPs), which offer multitarget regulation of ferroptosis. The characteristics of Ce@D&amp;P NPs are evaluated and their therapeutic effects on IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes are verified. Results show that Ce@D&amp;P NPs reduce ROS levels, mitigate inflammation, chelate iron to inhibit ferroptosis, and balance extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses suggest that Ce@D&amp;P NPs exerted their effects by regulating oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in chondrocytes. To better treat destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA in mice, Ce@D&amp;P NPs via intra-articular injection are delivered. The results show that Ce@D&amp;P NPs alleviate cartilage matrix damage and slow OA progression. Overall, the findings indicate that Ce@D&amp;P NPs represent a promising multitarget drug delivery system, and Ce@D&amp;P NPs may be an effective strategy for OA treatment.},

Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, utilizing their physical properties to achieve controllable cell-layer transport will be of fundamental importance. In this study, the ratchet effect is harnessed to control the collective motion of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro. NPCs travel back-and-forth and do not specify head or tail, and therefore regarded as nematics alike liquid crystals. Ratchet and splay-shaped confinements are crafted to modulate collective cell dynamics in dense environments, while jamming is not explicitly spotted. The adaptation of an agent-based simulation further revealed how the ratchet&#39;s asymmetry and active forces from nematic order synergistically reinforce the directional cell flow. These findings provide insights into topotaxis in cell populations when restricted to crowded 2D ratchets and the mechanisms that regulate collective behavior of the cells.},

  abstract     = {Ischemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease and the leading cause of permanent disability worldwide. Recent studies have shown that stroke development and prognosis are closely related to abnormal tryptophan metabolism. Here, significant downregulation of 3-hydroxy-kynurenamine (3-HKA) in stroke patients and animal models is identified. Supplementation with 3-HKA improved long-term neurological recovery, reduced infarct volume, and increased ipsilateral cerebral blood flow after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis, functional blood vessel formation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) repair. Moreover, 3-HKA inhibited A1-like (neurotoxic) astrocyte activation but promoted A2-like (neuroprotective) astrocyte polarization. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-HKA inhibited AIM2 inflammasome activation after stroke, and co-labeling studies indicated that AIM2 expression typically increased in astrocytes at 7 and 14 days after stroke. Consistently, in co-cultures of primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes, 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). AIM2 overexpression in astrocytes abrogated 3-HKA-driven vascular remodeling in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that 3-HKA may regulate astrocyte-mediated vascular remodeling by impeding AIM2 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, 3-HKA may promote post-stroke vascular remodeling by regulating A1/A2 astrocyte activation, thereby improving long-term neurological recovery, suggesting that supplementation with 3-HKA may be an efficient therapy for stroke.},

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a promising third-generation photovoltaic technology due to their high efficiency and low-cost potential. However, the stability of organohalide perovskites remains a significant challenge. Inorganic perovskites, based on CsPbX ₃ (X = Br − /I − ), have garnered attention for their excellent thermal stability and optoelectronic properties comparable to those of organohalide perovskites. Nevertheless, the development of inorganic perovskites faces several hurdles, including the need for high-temperature annealing to achieve the photoactive α-phase and their susceptibility to transitioning into the nonphotoactive δ-phase under environmental stressors, particularly moisture. These challenges impede the creation of high-efficiency, high-stability devices using low-cost, scalable manufacturing processes. This review provides a comprehensive background on the fundamental structural, physical, and optoelectronic properties of inorganic lead-halide perovskites. It discusses the latest advancements in fabricating inorganic PSCs at lower temperatures and under ambient conditions. Furthermore, it highlights the progress in state-of-the-art inorganic devices, particularly those manufactured in ambient environments and at reduced temperatures, alongside simultaneous advancements in the upscaling and stability of inorganic PSCs.},

Solution sequential doping of the blend film with AuCl 3 solution not only doped the conjugated polymer but also decomposed the QDs, resulting in a doped conjugated polymer film embedded with separated ions dissociated from the QDs. For the doped polymer-molten QD blend films with the optimal QD content, it is found that a greatly enhanced Seebeck coefficient is achieved compared to that of the doped polymer film without QDs, while the doping level and electrical conductivity are not significantly reduced by the QD incorporation. Consequently, the power factor is enhanced, reaching a remarkably high value of up to 401.9 µW m −1 K −2 (≈155% increase with the QDs). The applicability of this method to a variety of conjugated polymers is also demonstrated. The enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient is attributed to ion-induced local variations in the polymer work function, which generates an internal energy barrier for charge transport and causes an energy filtering effect.},

This crystal exhibits a band structure with both positive (positive group velocity) and negative slopes (negative group velocity), exciting and directing the water waves to produce forward and backward radiating wakes through a mechanism similar to CR.

The primary challenge in modulating this gap has been the absence of a direct method for observing changes of the band gap in momentum space. In this study, advanced spatial- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy technique is employed to directly visualize the gap formation in bilayer graphene, modulated by both displacement fields and moiré potentials. The application of displacement field via in situ electrostatic gating introduces a sizable and tunable electronic bandgap, proportional to the field strength up to 100 meV. Meanwhile, the moiré potential, induced by aligning the underlying hexagonal boron nitride substrate, extends the bandgap by ≈20 meV. Theoretical calculations effectively capture the experimental observations. This investigation provides a quantitative understanding of how these two mechanisms collaboratively modulate the band gap in bilayer graphene, offering valuable guidance for the design of graphene-based electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Asia-prevalent malignancy, yet its genetic underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Here, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is conducted on NPC, leveraging gene expression prediction models based on epithelial tissues and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from 1577 NPC cases and 6359 controls of southern Chinese descent. The TWAS identifies VAMP8 on chromosome 2p11.2 as a novel susceptibility gene for NPC. Further fine-mapping analyses pinpoint rs1058588, located within VAMP8 , as a causal variant through eQTL colocalization, and GWAS analyses across multiple cohorts, achieving GWAS significance (OR = 1.18, P = 3.09 × 10 −10 ). Functional assays demonstrate that VAMP8 exerts a tumorigenic role in NPC, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth. Mechanically, it is uncovered that rs1058588 modulates VAMP8 expression by altering its binding affinity to miR-185 . Furthermore, the results show that VAMP8 interacts with DHX9 to facilitate the nuclear recruitment of p65, activating the NF-κB pathway. Collectively, the findings shed light on the genetic predisposition to NPC and underscore the critical role of the functional axis involving miR-185, VAMP8, DHX9, and the NF-κB pathway in NPC pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and animal models of depression, key pathological hallmarks include activation of microglia as well as atrophy and loss of astrocytes. Under certain pathological conditions, microglia can inflict damage to neurons and astrocytes. However, the precise mechanisms underlying how activated microglia induced astrocyte atrophy and loss remain enigmatic. In this study, a depression model induced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is utilized. The results show that CSDS induces significant anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, along with notable astrocyte atrophy and apoptosis, microglial activation, and elevated levels of microglial interleukin-6 (IL-6). Subsequent studies demonstrate that IL-6 released from activated microglia promotes astrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, the knockdown of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in microglia, which is implicated in the stress response, reduces stress-induced microglial activation, IL-6 release, and astrocyte apoptosis. Direct inhibition of microglia by minocycline corroborates these effects. The selective knockdown of IL-6 in microglia and IL-6 receptors in astrocytes effectively mitigates depression-like behaviors and reduces astrocyte atrophy. This study identifies microglial IL-6 as a key factor that contributes to astrocyte apoptosis and depressive symptoms. Consequently, the IL-6/IL-6R pathway has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of depression.},

  abstract     = {Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), however, the metabolic shifts during the UC-to-CRC transition remain elusive. In this study, an AOM-DSS-induced three-stage colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) model is constructed and targeted metabolomics analysis and pathway enrichment are performed, uncovering the metabolic changes in this transition. Spatial metabolic trajectories in the “normal-to-normal adjacent tissue (NAT)-to-tumor” transition, and temporal metabolic trajectories in the “colitis-to-dysplasia-to-carcinoma” transition are identified through K-means clustering of 74 spatially and 77 temporally differential metabolites, respectively. The findings reveal two distinct metabolic profile categories during the inflammation-to-cancer progression: those with consistent changes, either increasing (e.g., kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid) or decreasing (e.g., long-chain fatty acids, LCFAs), and those enriched at specific disease stages (e.g., serotonin). Further analysis of metabolites with consistent temporal trends identifies eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as a key metabolite, potentially exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects by inhibiting insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5). This study reveals novel metabolic mechanisms underlying the transition from UC to CAC and suggests potential targets to delay the progression.},

However, unpredictable switching behavior and poor mechanical stability in conventional memristors present significant challenges to achieving device reliability. Here, a reliable and flexible memristor using zirconium-oxo cluster (Zr 6 O 4 OH 4 (OMc) 12 ) as the resistive switching layer is demonstrated. The optimization of the structural rigidity of the hybrid oxo-cluster network by thermal polymerization allows the precise formation of dispersed conductive cluster networks, enhancing the repeatability of the resistive switching with mechanical flexibility. The optimized memristor exhibits endurance of ∼10 4 cycles and stable memory retention performance up to 10 4 s, maintaining a high I ON / I OFF ratio of 10 4 under a bending radius of 2.5 mm. Moreover, the device achieves a pattern recognition accuracy of 97.44%, enabled by highly symmetric analog switching with multilevel conductance states. These results highlight that hybrid metal-oxo clusters can provide novel material design principles for flexible and reliable neuromorphic applications, contributing to the development of artificial neural networks.},

  abstract     = {METTL3, a key enzyme in N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, plays a crucial role in the progression of renal fibrosis, particularly in chronic active renal allograft rejection (CAR). This study explored the mechanisms by which METTL3 promotes renal allograft fibrosis, focusing on its role in the macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT). Using a comprehensive experimental approach, including TGF-β1-induced MMT cell models, METTL3 conditional knockout (METTL3 KO) mice, and renal biopsy samples from patients with CAR, the study investigates the involvement of METTL3/Smad3 axis in driving MMT and renal fibrosis during the episodes of CAR. We found that elevated m6A modification and METTL3 levels strongly correlated with enhanced MMT and increased fibrotic severity. METTL3 knockout (METTL3 KO) significantly increased the m6A modification of Smad3, decreased Smad3 expression, and inhibited M2-driven MMT. Smad3 knockdown with siRNA (siSmad3) further inhibited M2-driven MMT, while Smad3 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effects of METTL3 silencing, restoring M2-driven MMT and fibrotic tissue damage. Additionally, the METTL3 inhibitor STM2457 effectively reversed M2-driven MMT and alleviated fibrotic tissue damage in CAR. These findings highlight that METTL3 enhances M2-driven MMT in renal fibrosis during CAR by promoting the TGF-β1/Smad3 axis, suggesting that METTL3 is a promising therapeutic target for mitigating renal fibrosis in CAR.},

  abstract     = {Hemodynamic stabilization is crucial in managing acute cardiac events, where compromised blood flow can lead to severe complications and increased mortality. Conditions like decompensated heart failure (HF) and cardiogenic shock require rapid and effective hemodynamic support. Current mechanical assistive devices, such as intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), offer temporary stabilization but are limited to short-term use due to risks associated with prolonged blood contact. This research presents a novel proof-of-concept soft robotic device designed with the aim of achieving low-risk, medium-term counterpulsation therapy. The device employs a nature-inspired growing mechanism for potentially minimally invasive deployment around the ascending aorta, coupled with hydraulic artificial muscles for aortic compression. It demonstrated a maximum stroke volume of 16.48 ± 0.21 mL (SD, n = 5), outperforming all other non-pneumatic extra-aortic devices. In addition, in vitro tests with a mock circulation loop (MCL) show a drop in aortic end-diastolic pressure by 6.32 mmHg and enhance coronary flow under mild aortic stenosis, which attenuate the device&#39;s assistive effect. These findings highlight the device&#39;s strong potential for optimization as a promising solution to improve outcomes for hemodynamically unstable HF patients.},

Overcoming these obstacles requires an in-depth understanding of the correlations among the alterations in their geometries, packing structures, and molecular vibrations and their corresponding changes in their photoluminescence (PL) properties. Herein, it is demonstrated that high-pressure infrared, UV−visible absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopies can be combined with computational results to elucidate the influence of the subtle structural variations on the exciton‒vibration couplings and their PL properties. An ortho-carborane-decorated MR emitter (BNC) is a piezochromic molecule and exhibits emission enhancement under high pressure. A thorough analysis of the in situ experimental measurements and calculated results reveals that the pressure-induced changes in the exciton binding energy and exciton‒vibration couplings are responsible for the unusual piezochromism.

Herein, the potential of GH in disulfidptosis regulation, a novel form of programmed cell death induced by disulfide stress is explored. The omics results indicated that NRF2 signaling could be significantly activated by GH. The potential targets are associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and cell death. Moreover, both glutathione (GSH) metabolism and NADP + -NADPH metabolism are affected by GH, indicating the potential in disulfidptosis regulation. It is also observed that GH enhanced the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to disulfidptosis, which is dependent on the activation of NRF2-SLC7A11 pathway. GH significantly increased the levels of NRF2 and promoted the transcription of NRF2 target gene, SLC7A11, through autophagy-mediated non-canonical mechanism. Under the condition of glucose starvation, GH-induced upregulation of SLC7A11 aggravated uptake of cysteine, disturbance of GSH synthesis, depletion of NADPH, and accumulation of disulfide molecules, ultimately leading to the formation of disulfide bonds between different cytoskeleton proteins and disulfidptosis eventually. Collectively, the findings underscore the potential role of GH in promoting cancer cell disulfidptosis, thereby offering a promising avenue for the treatment of drug-resistant HCC in clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {Gram-positive bacteria pose significant threats to human health, necessitating the development of targeted bacterial detection and eradication strategies. Nevertheless, current approaches often suffer from poor targeting specificity. Herein, the study utilizes purple rice lixivium to synthesize biomass carbon dots (termed BCDs) with wheat germ agglutinin-like residues for precisely targeting Gram-positive bacteria. Subsequently, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules are grafted onto BCDs to yield FITC-labeled BCDs (termed CDFs), which can selectively and rapidly (≤5 min) stain bacterial cell wall and particularly target the peptidoglycan component. Strikingly, CDFs achieve superselective visualization of Gram-positive bacteria even in the presence of mammalian cells and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, protoporphyrin (PpIX) molecules are conjugated onto BCDs to yield PpIX-modified BCDs (termed CDPs), which can induce bacterial aggregation and in situ generate singlet oxygen for realizing enhanced antibacterial photodynamic therapy (PDT). At the minimum bactericidal concentration of CDPs (PpIX: 5 µg mL −1 ), CDP-mediated PDT disrupts bacterial structure and metabolism pathways, thereby affecting bacterial interactions to eradicate biofilms. Importantly, CDP-mediated PDT efficiently modulates antiinflammatory responses to promote wound healing in the bacteria-infected mice. This study underscores the significance of harnessing renewable and cost-effective biomass resources for preparing Gram-positive bacteria-targeting theranostic agents, which may find potential clinical applications in the future.},

  abstract     = {The primate cerebral cortex, the major organ for cognition, consists of an immense number of neurons. However, the organizational principles governing these neurons remain unclear. By accessing the single-cell spatial transcriptome of over 25 million neuron cells across the entire macaque cortex, it is discovered that the distribution of neurons within cortical layers is highly non-random. Strikingly, over three-quarters of these neurons are located in distinct neuronal clusters. Within these clusters, different cell types tend to collaborate rather than function independently. Typically, excitatory neuron clusters mainly consist of excitatory-excitatory combinations, while inhibitory clusters primarily contain excitatory-inhibitory combinations. Both cluster types have roughly equal numbers of neurons in each layer. Importantly, most excitatory and inhibitory neuron clusters form spatial partnerships, indicating a balanced local neuronal network and correlating with specific functional regions. These organizational principles are conserved across mouse cortical regions. These findings suggest that different brain regions of the cortex may exhibit similar mechanisms at the neuronal population level.},

However, such a phenomenon has not been explicitly observed in 3D device semiconductors at the nanoscale. Here, by employing a tip-enhanced Raman thermal measurement approach, substantial phonon nonequilibrium in gallium nitride near sub-10 nm laser-excited hotspots is directly revealed for the first time. As further evidence, quantitative agreements between measurements and accurate first-principles-based phonon Boltzmann transport equation calculations are obtained. The large nonequilibrium is attributed to the strong Fröhlich coupling of electrons with longitudinal optical phonons and the large acoustic-optical phonon frequency gap in gallium nitride, which is further demonstrated in other common III-V semiconductors. This work establishes a viable approach for understanding nanoscale nonequilibrium phonon transport and can potentially benefit the future modulation of hot carrier dynamics.},

Optimizing the neutron spectrum can improve the production efficiency of 238 Pu, but currently, it is still a lack of knowledge about the optimal neutron spectrum for 238 Pu production. Genetic algorithms and burnup algorithms are combined to identify optimal neutron spectra for 238 Pu production under various irradiation times and flux levels, and build an optimal neutron spectrum database, which answers the questions “What is the optimal neutron spectrum for 238 Pu production?” and “What is the maximum efficiency for 238 Pu production” once and for all. This database can be referred to for determining the optimal neutron spectrum, guiding the neutron spectrum regulation process to improve the yield of 238 Pu. Moreover, these results find that the production method of in-reactor irradiation 237 Np not only has a higher yield but also achieves a higher purity of 238 Pu than that of in-reactor irradiation 241 Am, which conflicts with the traditional experiences, providing with previously unknown insights and helping break through the efficiency limit of traditional methods, maximizing 238 Pu production.},

Here, the impacts of plant species and diversity on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in three agricultural soils are comprehensively investigated in a pot experiment. The results indicate that increased plant diversity reduces ARGs and MGEs abundance by 19.2%–51.2%, whereas plant species exhibit inconsistent and soil-dependent effects. Potential bacterial hosts harboring abundant ARGs have greater relative abundance than nonhosts, and both their richness and cumulative relative abundance are reduced by plant diversity. Notably, hosts inhibited by plant diversity present a greater relative abundance than the other hosts. The enriched compounds in root exudates due to plant diversity play a more important role in the metabolic network and contribute to rebalancing of the abundance of potential hosts and nonhosts. An independent test using pure organics reveals that higher resource diversity, resulting from increased plant diversity, reduces the relative abundance and mobility of abundant and high-risk ARGs. This study highlights the resource-mediated mitigation of the risks posed by ARG contamination and indicates that ensuring plant and resource diversity is a promising strategy for controlling ARGs in agroecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Dietary high salt intake is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies have identified a population of disease-associated astrocytes (DAA)-like astrocytes closely linked to amyloid deposition and tau pathology in an AD mouse model. However, the presence and role of these astrocytes in high-salt diet (HSD) models remain unexplored. In this study, it is demonstrated that HSD significantly induces enhanced reactivity of DAA-like astrocytes in the hippocampal CA3 region of mice, with this reactivity being critically dependent on neuronal tau pathology. Neuronal tau pathology activates adenosine A1R signaling, exacerbating tau pathology by inhibiting the Cers1 pathway, which sustains astrocyte reactivity. Additionally, neurons burdened with tau pathology promote astrocyte reactivity via releasing Proteins Associated with Promoting DAA-like Astrocyte Reactivity (PAPD), with Lcn2 playing a pivotal role. Knockout of Lcn2 or its receptor 24p3R significantly mitigates HSD-induced DAA reactivity and neuroinflammation. These findings suggest a vicious cycle between tau pathology and A1R signaling, driving DAA-like astrocyte reactivity. Targeting the Tau-A1R axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing HSD-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative joint disease, prominently influenced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Although elevated IL-6 levels in joint fluid are well-documented, the uneven cartilage degeneration observed in knee OA patients suggests additional underlying mechanisms. This study investigates the role of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) in mediating IL-6 signaling and its contribution to OA progression. Here, significantly elevated IL-6R expression is identified in degenerated cartilage of OA patients. Further, in vivo experiments reveal that intra-articular injection of recombinant IL-6R protein or activation of gp130 (Y757F mutation) accelerates OA progression. Conversely, knockout of IL-6R or JAK2, as well as treatment with a JAK inhibitor, alleviates OA symptoms. Mechanistically, chondrocytes derived from degenerative cartilage exhibit impaired nuclear localization of SOX9, a key regulator of cartilage homeostasis. JAK inhibition stabilizes SIRT1, reduces SOX9 acetylation, and thereby facilitates SOX9 nuclear localization, promoting cartilage repair. Additionally, the JAK inhibitor-induced apoptosis in p21-positive senescent cells, and their targeted clearance successfully alleviates OA in p21-3MR mice. In conclusion, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which inhibiting the IL-6R/JAK2 pathway can alleviate OA. Furthermore, this study proposes targeting p21-positive senescent cells as a new therapeutic strategy for OA.},

Although various physical and biological effects of FUS have been well-documented, there is still a lack of understanding and direct evidence on the biological mechanism of therapeutic cell ablation caused by high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) and the subsequent wound healing responses. This study develops an enclosed cell culture device that synergistically combines non-invasive FUS stimulation and real-time, on-the-fly live-cell imaging, providing an in vitro platform to explore short and long-term biological effects of ultrasound. The process, mechanism, and wound healing response of cell ablation induced by HIFU are elucidated, revealing a unique mechanism, termed ultrasound-inflicted cellular mechanolysis, that is mediated by growing subcellular cavitation air bubbles under confined contact with cells. This provides a previously unappreciated mechanism for understanding the biomechanical principles of ultrasound-based ablative therapy. A post-ablation phantom layer is also revealed that serves as a guiding cue for collective cell migration during wound healing, thereby providing a biomimetic model for studying wound healing after HIFU-inflicted damage. Together, this study provides theoretical and technological basis for advancing the understanding of the biological effects of ultrasound-based ablative therapy and inspiring clinically relevant applications in the future.},

  abstract     = {The advent of biomacromolecules antagonizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has revolutionized the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). However, frequent intravitreal injections of these biomacromolecules impose an enormous burden on patients and create a massive workload for healthcare providers. This causes patients to abandon therapy, ultimately leading to progressive and irreversible vision loss. In order to address this unmet clinical need, a noninvasive treatment for nAMD is developed. An optimized cell-penetrating peptide derivative, bxy Penetratin (bxyWP), is used to non-covalently complex with the anti-VEGF protein aflibercept (AFL) via reversible hydrophobic interaction. The interaction is crucial for AFL delivery, neither impairing the affinity of AFL to pathological VEGF, nor being interfered by endogenous proteins in tear fluids. AFL/bxyWP eye drops exhibit prolonged retention on the eye and excellent absorption into the posterior ocular segment following topical administration, with significant drug distribution to the retina and choroid. In a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model on cynomolgus monkeys, AFL/bxyWP eye drops efficiently reduce lesion size and leakage comparable to conventional intravitreal injection of AFL. These results suggest that AFL/bxyWP eye drops are feasible self-administered treatment for neovascular retinal diseases and potentially become a substitute for intravitreal injections.},

The micro- and nanoscale architecture critically influences the mechanical and electrochemical performance of these electrodes. However, achieving a balance between high compressive strength, electrochemical stability, and cost-effective sustainable production remains challenging. Here, a superelastic wood nanocarbon sponge (WNCS) with a wrinkled multilayer structure is developed via a facile “top–down” design on natural wood. These unique wrinkled nanolayers effectively alleviate stress concentration through elastic deformation, resulting in a high compressive strength of 580.6 kPa at 70% reversible strain. The significantly increased specific surface area, coupled with abundant micro-mesopores and highly graphitized nanocarbon, promotes rapid ion/electron transport, enabling the WNCS to achieve an ultrahigh capacitance of 4.21 F cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2 , along with excellent cyclic stability and rate capability. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using a WNCS anode and a NiCo-layered double hydroxide cathode retains 71.8% of its initial capacitance after 1000 compression cycles and withstands stress up to 1.03 MPa without capacitance degradation. This sustainable, cost-effective WNCS shows great promise for flexible, compressible, and wearable electrochemical energy systems.},

The membrane serves as the interface between the circulating air-flow and the ambient water, preventing water flux while allowing an oxygen flux across the membrane, driven by a partial oxygen pressure gradient. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, a prototype system was built based on guidelines derived from a mathematical model that was developed to describe the oxygen transfer process. A computational fluid dynamics model is developed and validated against the measurements from the prototype, resulting in a digital twin.

  abstract     = {Achieving a substantial increase in the ammonia productivity of the Haber-Bosch (HB) process at low temperatures has been a significant challenge for over 100 years. However, the iron catalyst designed over 100 years ago remains at the forefront of this process because it is difficult to exceed the industrial iron catalyst in terms of the ammonia synthesis rate/catalyst volume that determines ammonia productivity in a reactor. Here, a new catalyst with an inverse structure of a supported metal catalyst that consists of metallic iron particles loaded with an aluminum hydride species is reported. The iron catalyst is readily prepared from an α-Fe 2 O 3 precursor and ammonia could be synthesized at more than twice the ammonia synthesis rate/catalyst volume of the conventional industrial iron catalyst, even though the specific surface area of the former is only half that of the latter. In addition, ammonia synthesis over the catalyst is observed with a small apparent activation energy at 50 °C. Mechanistic studies suggested that an increase in the active sites with strong electron-donating capability on the iron catalyst significantly increased the ammonia synthesis rate/catalyst surface area, which resulted in high catalytic activity/catalyst volume.},

Most in vitro systems used to study nuclear deformations impose whole-cell confinement that mimics the physical crowding experienced by cells during 3D migration through tissues. Such systems, however, do not reproduce the types of nuclear deformations expected to occur in cells that line tissues such as endothelial or epithelial cells whose physical confinement stems principally from the topography of their underlying basement membrane. Here, it is shown that endothelial cells and myoblasts cultured on microgroove substrates that mimic the anisotropic topography of the basement membrane exhibit large-scale 3D nuclear deformations, with partial to complete nuclear penetration into the microgrooves. These deformations do not lead to significant DNA damage and are dynamic with nuclei cyclically entering and exiting the microgrooves. Atomic force microscopy measurements show that these deformation cycles are accompanied by transient changes in perinuclear stiffness. Interestingly, nuclear penetration into the grooves is driven principally by cell-substrate adhesion stresses, with a limited need for cytoskeleton-associated forces. Finally, it is demonstrated that myoblasts from laminopathy patients exhibit abnormal nuclear deformations on microgrooves, raising the possibility of using microgroove substrates as a novel functional diagnostic platform for pathologies that involve abnormal nuclear mechanics.},

  abstract     = {Vascular calcification is a highly regulated process in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is strongly correlated with morbidity and mortality, especially in the adverse stage of vascular remodeling after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). However, the pathogenesis of vascular graft calcification, particularly the role of endothelial-smooth muscle cell interaction, is still unclear. To test how ECs interact with SMCs in artery grafts, single-cell analysis of wild-type mice is first performed using an arterial isograft mouse model and found robust cytokine-mediated signaling pathway activation and SMC proliferation, together with upregulated endothelial tripartite motif 35 (TRIM35) expression. Unexpectedly, severe SMC calcification in artery grafts is found in TRIM35 conditional endothelial knockout (cKO) mice. Calcified medium (comprising calcium chloride and beta-glycerophosphate)-induced calcium deposition in vitro is also found in SMCs cocultured with TRIM35 knockout endothelium. This extraordinary phenomenon is further confirmed to be induced by increased MMP10 secretion. Mechanistically, endothelial TRIM35 inhibits MMP10 expression and secretion by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of RelB and maintaining its nuclear localization, consequently inhibiting nuclear transcription of MMP10 through the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Targeting MMP10 in situ in arterial isografts can effectively alleviate vascular calcification caused by conditional endothelial TRIM35 knockout. These findings demonstrated that TRIM35 inhibited vascular calcification during arterial isograft remodeling, a process that is driven by the aberrant secretion of endothelial MMP10. Targeting MMP10 pathway may be a potential therapeutic strategy for vascular calcification in vessel grafts.},

However, due to the undefined chemical structure, toxicity, non-biodegradability, and lack of design technology in many existing adjuvants, it remains difficult to achieve substantive breakthroughs in the adjuvant research field. Here, a novel adjuvant development strategy based on stapling peptides is reported to overcome this challenge. The nano-vaccine incorporating peptide adjuvant and recombinant HBsAg protein not only induced strong antibody titers that are equivalent to aluminum adjuvanted vaccines but also simultaneously activated T-cell immune response. Similar results are also observed in herpes zoster vaccine and more complex influenza vaccine. The mechanism analysis demonstrates that antigen is efficiently carried into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by peptide, further promoting the secretion of cytokines and activation of APCs. In addition, by redesigning the adjuvant, it is found that the sulfonium centers, rather than the sequence of peptide played an important role in immune activation. This discovery may provide a new paradigm for the rational design of peptide-based adjuvants. In brief, this study demonstrates that stapling peptides with sulfonium centers can provide a well-defined, programmable, biocompatible, and effective adjuvant for multiple types of vaccines.},

  abstract     = {Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier results in increased permeability and is a key factor in the onset and progression of Crohn&#39;s disease (CD). The protein SPARC is primarily involved in cell interaction and migration, but its specific role in the intestinal epithelial barrier remains unclear. This study demonstrates that SPARC is significantly overexpressed in both CD patients and murine models of colitis. Furthermore, mice deficient in SPARC exhibits resistance to chemically induced colitis, a phenomenon associated with the modulation of barrier-associated proteins. Mechanistically, it is elucidated that SPARC competitively binds to OTUD4 in conjunction with MYD88, facilitating the translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and subsequent activation of the p65-MLCK/MLC2 pathway, thereby compromising barrier integrity. Additionally, it is identified that the elevated expression of SPARC in CD is regulated via the METTL3-YTHDF1 axis. These findings indicate that SPARC levels are elevated in patients with CD and in colitis-induced mice, leading to intestinal barrier damage through direct interaction with OTUD4 and subsequent activation of the MYD88/p65/MLCK/MLC2 signaling pathway. Consequently, targeting SPARC or the OTUD4/MYD88/p65/MLCK/MLC2 axis may offer novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CD and represent a potential therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {Plants activate defense machinery when infested by herbivorous insects but avoid such costs in the absence of herbivory. However, the key signaling pathway regulators underlying such flexibility and the mechanisms that insects exploit these components to disarm plant defense systems remain elusive. Here, it is reported that immune repressor 14-3-3e in rice Oryza sativa (OsGF14e) regulates immune homeostasis. Infestation with brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens decreased OsGF14e expression; however, the level of downregulation is limited both by the short duration and the specific feeding location. OsGF14e interacts with Enhanced Disease Resistance 1-like (OsEDR1l), a Raf-like MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), and repressed jasmonic acid, jasmonic acid-isoleucine, and H 2 O 2 accumulation by enhancing OsEDR1l abundance and signaling ability. OsGF14e and OsEDR1l overexpression renders rice susceptible to BPH, whereas their knockout increases plant resistance but compromises rice growth and grain yield. Intriguingly, BPH 14-3-3e protein (Nl14) that shares high sequence homology and structural similarity with OsGF14e is identified from BPH saliva and egg-associated secretions. Mediated through BPH feeding and oviposition, Nl14, similar to OsGF14e, interacts with OsEDR1l and triggers the OsEDR1l signaling, thereby suppressing plant defenses and facilitating BPH infestation. Apparently, structural and functional mimicry makes it possible for this newly discovered BPH effector to exploit rice OsGF14e-EDR1l immune suppression module. The results reveal a novel mechanism deployed by herbivorous insects, in a manner similar to certain pathogen effectors, to evade host plant defenses by mimicking host immune regulators.},

Herein, this study draws inspiration from the electronic structure of transition metal vanadium, proposing the leverage of TME specific-features to induce structural transformations in sheet-like vanadium carbide MXenzymes (TVMz). These transformations trigger cascading catalytic reactions that amplify oxidative stress, thereby significantly enhancing multimodal tumor therapy. Specifically, the engineered HTVMz, coated with hyaluronic acid, exhibits good stability and generates a thermal effect under NIR-II laser irradiation. The thermal effect, combined with TME characteristics, facilities a structural transformation into ultra-small vanadium oxide nanozymes (VO x ). The enlarged surface area of VO x substantially enhances ROS regeneration and amplifies oxidative stress, which promotes lysosomal permeability and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. The high-valent vanadium in VO x interacts with intracellular glutathione, disrupting redox homeostasis and intensifying oxidative stress further. These amplifications accelerate tumor apoptosis, induce ferroptosis, and suppress HSP90 expression. Consequently, the heightened thermal sensitivity of HTVMz synergistically promotes tumor cell death via multimodal therapeutic pathways. This study presents an innovative strategy for tumor catalytic therapy by manipulating MXenzymes structures, advancing the field of catalytic therapy.},

However, the precise mechanism by which tumor cells prompt TAMs to aid in evading immune surveillance remains to be further investigated. Here, it is elucidated that tumor-secreted galectin-1 (Gal1) conferred immunosuppressive properties to TAMs. Specifically, patient specimens and a public database is first used to analyze the clinical relevance of Gal1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Then, it is demonstrated that TAMs functioned as a critical mediator in the Gal1-induced progression of HCC and the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing determined that Gal1 promoted the upregulation of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) in TAMs via activating the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Employing an anti-CCL20 neutralizing antibody and Foxp3DTR mice, it is demonstrated that CCR6 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) recruited by Gal1-induced TAMs contributed to reduced infiltration and dysfunctional state of CD8 + T cells, subsequently facilitating tumor progression. Targeting Gal1 dampened the secretion of CCL20 and inhibits the recruitment of Tregs, thereby activating anti-tumor immunity and ameliorating anti-PD-1 resistance. Together, this findings revealed that Gal1-induced TAMs recruited Tregs through the CCL20-CCR6 axis. Inhibition of Gal1 improves the effectiveness of anti-PD1 therapy, shedding important new light on the combination immunotherapy of HCC.},

However, the properties of the hAECs and their proliferative mechanisms remain unclear. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is performed on hAECs obtained from amniotic tissues at different gestational ages and passages during in vitro culture. The results showed that the proliferation of hAECs is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) during amniogenesis. Freshly isolated, full-term hAECs are identified as mature epithelial cells. Once cultured in vitro, they are observed to rapidly undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enter a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) state to regain their EMP properties and proliferation capacities. With the continuous development of EMT, hAECs eventually enter a senescent state. The addition of SB431542 and microcarrier screening enabled the effective 3D expansion of hAECs by 50 fold while maintaining the EMP status in hAECs for further proliferation. This study not only elucidated the central proliferation mechanism of hAECs during development and expansion but also optimized the in vitro culture system so that it is sufficient to generate hAECs for 50 patients from a single donor amniotic membrane.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in obese patients remains challenging. Recent studies have linked obesity to an increased risk of TNBC and malignancies. Through multiomic analysis and experimental validation, a dysfunctional Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit H (EIF3H)/Yes-associated protein (YAP) proteolytic axis is identified as a pivotal junction mediating the interplay between cancer-associated adipocytes and the response to anti-cancer drugs in TNBC. Mechanistically, cancer-associated adipocytes drive metabolic reprogramming resulting in an upregulated hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This aberrant upregulation of HBP promotes YAP O-GlcNAcylation and the subsequent recruitment of EIF3H deubiquitinase, which stabilizes YAP, thus promoting tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance. It is found that Retatrutide, an anti-obesity agent, inhibits HBP and YAP O-GlcNAcylation leading to increased YAP degradation through the deprivation of EIF3H-mediated deubiquitylation of YAP. In preclinical models of obese TNBC, Retatrutide downregulates HBP, decreases YAP protein levels, and consequently decreases tumor size and enhances chemotherapy efficacy. This effect is particularly pronounced in obese mice bearing TNBC tumors. Overall, these findings reveal a critical interplay between adipocyte-mediated metabolic reprogramming and EIF3H-mediated YAP proteolytic control, offering promising therapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on TNBC progression.},

  abstract     = {Intranasal delivery of mRNA vaccines offers promising opportunities to combat airborne viruses like SARS-CoV-2 by provoking mucosal immunity, which not only defends against respiratory infection but also prevents contagious transmission. However, the development of nasal mRNA vaccines has been hampered by the lack of effective means to overcome the mucus barrier. Herein, ionizable lipid-incorporated liquid lipid nanoparticles (iLLNs) capable of delivering mRNA cargo across airway mucosa are designed. Adjusting the ratios of ionizable and cationic lipids allows fine-tuning of the p K a of iLLNs to the range of nasal mucosal pH (5.5–6.5), thus facilitating mucus penetration via the formation of near-neutral, PEGylated muco-inert surfaces. When nasally administered to mice, the top candidate iLLN-2/mRNA complexes enable about 60-fold greater reporter gene expression in the nasal cavity, compared to the benchmark mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (ALC-LNP) having the same lipid composition as that of BNT162b2 vaccine. Moreover, a prime-boost intranasal immunization of iLLN-2/mRNA complexes elicits a greater magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific mucosal IgA and IgG response than ALC-LNP, without triggering any noticeable inflammatory reactions. Taken together, these results provide useful insights for the design of nasally deliverable mRNA formulations for prophylactic applications.},

  abstract     = {Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with well-established metabolic risk factors, especially hyperlipidemia and obesity. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (mIRI) significantly offsets the therapeutic efficacy of revascularization. Previous studies indicated that disrupted lipid homeostasis can lead to lipid peroxidation damage and inflammation, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, the study demonstrates that hyperlipidemia is a key driver of mIRI. Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) is upregulated in both hyperlipidemia and AMI patients. ACSL1 expression is induced by a high-fat microenvironment (oxLDL and palmitic acid) in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, the protein level is positively correlated with total cholesterol level and thromboinflammatory biomarkers. Furthermore, ACSL1 reprogrammed lipid metabolism in monocytes, leading to the accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)/lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The monocytic LPC/LPA axis accelerated lipid peroxidation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-induced thromboinflammation via the paracrine effect. The main LPA producer Autotaxinis is also induced under high-fat conditions and then exerts thromboinflammation response through converted LPC to LPA. Finally, ACSL1 knockdown or NETs release inhibitor (DNase I or GSK484) significantly alleviated mIRI in mice. These findings highlight ACSL1 and NETosis as potential key targets for preventing mIRI and underscore the lipid peroxidation in the mechanisms of ACSL1-mediated thromboinflammation.},

Lung is the most vulnerable target organ in sepsis, but the understanding of the pulmonary immunosuppression state is still limited. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is performed to map the landscape of immune cells, revealing a neutrophil-driven immunosuppressive program in the lungs of patients with immunosuppressive sepsis. Although immunosuppressive genes are upregulated in different immune cells, only neutrophils dramatically increase in the BALF of patients in immunosuppressive phase of sepsis. Five neutrophil subpopulations in BALF are identified, among which CXCR2 + and CD274 ( PD-L1 coding gene) + IL1RN + neutrophil subpopulations increased significantly during septic immunosuppression. Interestingly, a developmental trajectory from CXCR2 + to CD274 + IL1RN + neutrophil subpopulation is disclosed. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of CXCR2 blockade is observed on the survival of septic mice, along with a decreased number of PD-L1 + neutrophils.

Stem cell is of great importance in bone regeneration, and periosteum is rich in periosteal stem cell, which has a great influence on repairing bone defects. Bioengineered periosteum with excellent biocompatibility and stem cell homing capabilities to promote bone regeneration is of great clinical significance. The E7 peptide (EPLQLKM), which exhibits a specific affinity for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), is beneficial for modulating cellular functions. In this study, a unique microporous structured carboxymethyl chitosan/sodium alginate membrane with a proper mass ratio is developed by the addition of Poloxam 407 （P407）, which is then functionalized with the E7 affinitive peptide. This membrane, characterized by its microporous structure and E7 peptide functionalization (CSSA/P/E), not only demonstrated favorable mechanical properties, enhanced hydrophilicity, satisfactory biodegradation profile, and excellent biocompatibility, but also synergistically enhanced MSCs recruitment. It is found to promote the proliferation, spreading, and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro and to accelerate early periosteal regeneration, bone matrix deposition, and vascularization in vivo, leading to effective regeneration of critical-sized bone defects. Overall, this study presents a robust, cell and growth factor-free strategy for bioengineering periosteum, offering a potential solution for the challenging large size bone defects.},

Strengthening the pelvic floor with bioactive tissue-engineered meshes is an emerging concept. This study investigates tissue regenerative design parameters, including degradability, porosity, and angulation, to develop alternative degradable melt electrowritten (MEW) constructs for surgical applications of POP. MEW constructs were fabricated in hierarchical geometries by two-way stacking of the fibers with three different inter layer angles of 90°, 45°, or 22.5°. Implants printed at 22.5° have higher tensile strength under dry conditions and show better vaginal fibroblast (VF) attachment in vitro. In vivo assessment using preclinical mouse and ovine models demonstrates more effective degradation and improved tissue integration in 22.5° angular meshes compared to 90° and 45° meshes, with evidence of neo-collagen deposition within implants at 6 weeks. The pattern and geometry of the layered MEW implants also influence the foreign body response, wherein the anti-inflammatory phenotype shows a greater ratio of anti-inflammatory CD206+ M2 macrophages/pro-inflammatory CCR7+ M1 macrophages. This presents an attractive strategy for improving the design and fabrication of next-generation vaginal implants for pelvic reconstructive surgery.},

  abstract     = {Aspartate (Asp) metabolism-mediated antioxidant functions have important implications for neonatal growth and intestinal health; however, the antioxidant mechanisms through which Asp regulates the gut microbiota and influences RIP activation remain elusive. This study reports that chronic oxidative stress disrupts gut microbiota and metabolite balance and that such imbalance is intricately tied to the perturbation of Asp metabolism. Under normal conditions, in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that exogenous Asp improves intestinal health by regulating epithelial cell proliferation, nutrient uptake, and apoptosis. During oxidative stress, Asp reduces Megasphaera abundance while increasing Ruminococcaceae . This reversal effect depends on the enhanced production of the antioxidant eicosapentaenoic acid mediated through Asp metabolism and microbiota. Mechanistically, the application of exogenous Asp orchestrates the antioxidant responses in enterocytes via the modulation of the RIP3-MLKL and RIP1-Nrf2-NF-κB pathways to eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species and maintain mitochondrial functionality and cellular survival. These results demonstrate that Asp signaling alleviates oxidative stress by dynamically modulating the gut microbiota and RIP-dependent mitochondrial function, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for oxidative stress disease treatment.},

  abstract     = {Despite an extensive body of literature on trust in technology, designing trustworthy AI systems for high-stakes decision domains remains a significant challenge. Widely used system design guidelines and tools are rarely attuned to domain-specific trustworthiness principles. In this study, we introduce a design framework to address this gap within intelligence analytic tasks, called the Principles-based Approach for Designing Trustworthy, Human-centered AI using the MAST Methodology (PADTHAI-MM). PADTHAI-MM builds on the Multisource AI Scorecard Table (MAST), an AI decision support system evaluation tool designed in accordance to the U.S. Intelligence Community&#39;s standards for system trustworthiness. We demonstrate PADTHAI-MM in our development of the Reporting Assistant for Defense and Intelligence Tasks (READIT), a research platform that leverages data visualizations and natural language processing-based text analysis to emulate AI-enabled intelligence reporting aids. To empirically assess the efficacy of PADTHAI-MM, we developed two versions of READIT for comparison: a “High-MAST” version, which incorporates AI contextual information and explanations, and a “Low-MAST” version, designed to be akin to inscrutable “black box” AI systems. Through an iterative design process guided by stakeholder feedback, our multidisciplinary design team developed prototypes that were evaluated by experienced intelligence analysts. Results substantially supported the viability of PADTHAI-MM in designing for system trustworthiness in this task domain. We also explored the relationship between analysts&#39; MAST ratings and three theoretical categories of information known to impact trust: process , purpose , and performance . Overall, our study supports the practical and theoretical viability of PADTHAI-MM as an approach to designing trustable AI systems.},

In this paper, we attempt to address this issue in a parsimonious manner (i.e., achieving greater potential with simpler models). The key is to drive models using domain-specific knowledge, such as symbols, logic, and formulas, instead of purely relying on scaleup. This approach allows us to build a framework that uses this knowledge as “building blocks” to achieve parsimony in model design, training, and interpretation. Empirical results show that our methods surpass those that typically follow the scaling law. We also demonstrate our framework in AI for science, specifically in the problem of drug-drug interaction prediction. We hope our research can foster more diverse technical roadmaps in the era of foundation models.},

In this article, we provide the first comprehensive survey of security and privacy issues associated with machine unlearning by providing a systematic classification across different levels and criteria. Specifically, we begin by investigating unlearning-based security attacks, where adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in the unlearning process to compromise the security of machine learning (ML) models. We then conduct a thorough examination of privacy risks associated with the adoption of machine unlearning. Additionally, we explore existing countermeasures and mitigation strategies designed to protect models from malicious unlearning-based attacks targeting both security and privacy. Further, we provide a detailed comparison between machine unlearning-based security and privacy attacks and traditional malicious attacks. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions for security and privacy issues posed by machine unlearning, offering insights into potential solutions and advancements in this evolving field.},

  abstract     = {We investigate and observe the behavior and performance of Large Language Model (LLM)-backed chatbots in addressing misinformed prompts and questions with demographic information within the domains of Climate Change and Mental Health. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, we assess the chatbots&#39; ability to discern the veracity of statements, their adherence to facts, and the presence of bias or misinformation in their responses. Our quantitative analysis using True/False questions reveals that these chatbots can be relied on to give the right answers to these close-ended questions. However, the qualitative insights, gathered from domain experts, shows that there are still concerns regarding privacy, ethical implications, and the necessity for chatbots to direct users to professional services. We conclude that while these chatbots hold significant promise, their deployment in sensitive areas necessitates careful consideration, ethical oversight, and rigorous refinement to ensure they serve as a beneficial augmentation to human expertise rather than an autonomous solution.

The soft actuator is realized by rolling a mat of two active layers, interleaved with two electrodes. The active layers are mats of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)-based nanofibers, embedded in an elastomeric matrix of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The electrodes are made of a mixture of carbon black and PDMS, bonded to the active layers by electrostatic adhesion force. The effects of the nanofibers in the soft actuators are investigated. Specimens of the soft actuator are realized that differ in the thickness of the nanofibrous mats used for the active layers, that is, 60 and 120 μm. An electromechanical characterization is performed to analyze and measure the axial force and axial displacements of the soft actuators when different electric fields are applied to the specimens in the transversal direction. The experimental results show that the presence of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)-based nanofibers enhances the force-to-weight ratio of the soft actuators by up to 43.5%, and the energy density by up to 12.9%, compared to a control specimen with the active layer made of PDMS only.},

  abstract     = {Printed electronics have traditionally used substrates and materials derived from fuel-based or less abundant and toxic resources, raising environmental concerns. Wood as a substrate reduces processing steps and enables the integration of intelligent functionalities in wooden furniture, offering biodegradability, nontoxicity, and derivation from renewable sources. In this work, sustainably printed transistors using zinc oxide nanoparticles as the active layer and honey electrolyte on wood substrates are demonstrated as a promising approach to reduce the environmental footprint of electronics. Despite the substrate&#39;s high roughness, the transistor exhibits excellent performance for screen-printed devices, with low on-voltage of 0.32 ± 0.12 V and high I on /I off of (2.4 ± 0.9) × 10 4 . Further analysis of hysteresis in transfer curves under varying scan rates and sweep ranges reveals the device&#39;s ability to adjust memory windows and on-current. Notably, these devices successfully emulate synapses, exhibiting neural facilitation and plasticity, indicating a shift toward sustainable computing. The device&#39;s dynamic response to single and successive presynaptic pulses demonstrates its ability to adjust synaptic weight, transition from transient to persistent memory, and pulse width-, frequency-, voltage-, and number-dependent excitatory postsynaptic currents. The successful emulation of the learning–forgetting–relearning–forgetting process underscores the device&#39;s potential for use in sustainable high-performance neuromorphic systems.},

  abstract     = {For energy- and time-efficient artificial intelligence (AI) computing, implementing hardware-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) has become a core technology. In SNNs, synaptic devices store weights in memory, and neurons process received weighted information and generate spike signals. Upon feeding spike signals into synaptic arrays, the synaptic weights multiply the signals, which subsequently sum up to perform vector-matrix multiplication (VMM). Simultaneous access to multiple synaptic devices, however, reduces the equivalent resistance of these synaptic arrays. This reduction alters the voltage division between the pre-synaptic array and the input resistance of the neuron circuit, distorting the read voltage across synaptic devices. This phenomenon is known as the fan-in problem, which leads to non-ideal VMM operations and degrades system accuracy. To address this issue, a novel compensated current mirror (CCM) neuron circuit is proposed, which incorporates a single additional transistor into a conventional current mirror. This CCM neuron achieves exceptional current linearity ( R 2 &gt; 0.999) and efficiently compensates for VMM error with low complexity and energy consumption (3.33 pJ spike −1 ). Furthermore, the CCM neuron demonstrates ≈7-%p higher inference accuracy than conventional ones when integrated with a 512 × 512 large-scale synaptic array, which is comparable to the accuracy of software-based SNNs.},

On the other hand, visually impaired users rely on tactile displays as one of the key communication devices to interact with the digital world. However, due to their working mechanism and the uneven surface of tactile displays, one of the key features of screens for sighted users is surprisingly challenging to implement: precision touch input. To overcome this, a hand gesture recognition system is developed using a frequency-modulated continuous wave millimeter-wave radar. A multifeature encoder method is used to obtain the range and velocity information from the radar to translate the data into spectrogram images. Gesture recognition is implemented for common input gestures: single/double-click, swipe-right/left, scroll-up/down, zoom-in/out, and rotate-anticlockwise/clockwise. The gesture recognition and classification are based on machine learning, support vector machines, deep learning, and convolutional neural network approaches. The chosen model You-Only-Look-Once (YOLOv8) shows a high accuracy of 97.1% by iterating only 30 epochs with only 500 collected data samples per gesture. This research paves the way toward using radar sensors not only for tactile displays but also for other digital devices in human–computer interaction.},

  abstract     = {Switchable surface adhesion at a small scale is crucial for robot end-effector design, allowing the manipulation of small objects such as semiconductors, optical lenses, and precision mechanical parts. In this work, a detailed characterization of a millimeter-scale (1–5 mm) adhesion modulation method is performed, demonstrating its effectiveness for switching adhesion on small, lightweight objects with smooth surfaces. This modulation phenomenon arises from the viscoelastic behavior when PDMS interacts with a rigid surface and is controlled via microvibration. A maximum apparent adhesion enhancement of 2400% and a reduction of 50% are achieved with a 1 mm-diameter PDMS hemisphere vibrating at a 30 μm amplitude and a 700 Hz frequency. The effects of different parameters, including size, actuation amplitude/frequency, surface roughness, and material properties, on adhesion performance are carefully measured and analyzed. A monotonic increase in maximum adhesion is observed with increased device size and surface smoothness, while nonlinear relationships of other factors are generalized with a numerical model. A long working lifespan and high endurance are also observed during the characterization. This work serves as a practical reference for the further design of small-scale soft grippers, highlighting its continuous, large modulation range, simple structure, and flexible control.},

Hodgkin–Huxley (H–H) neurons based on memristors feature great merits of high bio-plausibility and low hardware cost. However, a universal design rule of memristive H–H neurons is still lacking, hindering its development and applications. Herein, a universal H–H neuron circuit structure is proposed and its feasibility based on NbO x memristors is demonstrated. The constructed neuron achieves 23 types of firing behaviors observed in biological neurons, simplifying the communication between neurons. To better understand the correlation between circuit parameters and firing patterns, the firing patterns into three classes according to the switching cycle ratio of two memristors are categorized. The circuit design rules of each category of firing patterns are deeply elucidated and universal regularities for tuning circuit parameters to implement the switch between different firing behaviors are presented. Finally, the potential applications of different firing behaviors in neuromorphic intelligence systems are discussed. This work provides theoretical guidance for engineering memristive H–H neuron circuits, assisting in building high-order neuromorphic systems based on firing patterns.},

  abstract     = {Soft tactile sensors outputting fluidic signals have many potential applications in soft microfluidic devices and soft robots. However, existing systems have been limited to a single or a few sensors in parallel, so they are not comparable to the state-of-the-art electrical resistive and capacitive touchpads, which can detect rich tactile information, including touch location, pressure, area, and even multiple touches simultaneously. This work reports a soft micropneumatic touchpad. The touchpad consists of 32 pneumatic channels inside soft elastomer, with 16 channels aligned row-wise and 16 column-wise. The flow resistance of each channel is measured using a pressure divider. When the pad is touched, the cross-sectional area of the channels close to the contact location deforms, which changes the flow resistance of those channels. With 32 sensing channels, the location, depth, area of the contact, and even two simultaneous touches can be detected. Letters hand-written on the touchpad can be reconstructed from the measured data. With the assumption of sparsity, a tactile pressure map, with a value at each 16 × 16 grid point, can also be reconstructed. This work opens a path to replace electronic tactile sensors in soft devices with all-fluidic alternatives.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an extended Cartesian space robot control framework that features a virtual force tracking impedance control to enhance the end-effector trajectory tracking performance. Initially, the concept of a virtual surface is introduced, which is assumed to be at some constant distance from the desired end-effector trajectory. This virtual surface generates a virtual contact force when interacting with the torque-controlled robot end-effector. The interaction is then manipulated using an impedance control model to track a constant desired force. If the robot end-effector deviates from the desired trajectory, the constant force-tracking impedance control generates a compliance trajectory that regulates the end-effector movements, constraining it to the desired trajectory. For robust force tracking, impedance parameters are optimally tuned using a closed-loop dynamic model incorporating both robot and impedance dynamics. Additionally, super twisting sliding mode control (STSMC) is integrated to overcome uncertainties and the impact of robot dynamics on force-tracking performance. Experimental validation confirms the theoretical claims of the proposed approach. It demonstrates that force-tracking impedance control improves the end-effector trajectory tracking by quickly reacting to the dynamic trajectories compared to position control only and effectively maintains it on the desired trajectories.},

By collaborating across multiple institutions, the study seeks to develop models that allow rapid online estimation of organ doses, eliminating the need for complex organ segmentation. Researchers delineate skin outlines from chest CT images obtained from two different institutions. Radiomics features are extracted from the chest CT data and skin contours. Organ doses are computed using Monte Carlo simulations as reference organ doses. Single- and cross-institutional support vector regression (SVR) models are trained with radiomics features to predict organ doses from chest CT scans. Model performance is assessed using metrics like maean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R -squared ( R 2 ). For chest organs (lungs, heart, spinal cord, trachea, and esophagus), single-institutional SVR models achieve MAPE values ranging from 4.72% to 15.31% and R 2 values from 0.73 to 0.93. Cross-institutional models have MAPE values in the range of 2.16–7.49% and R 2 values from 0.84 to 0.99. SVR models trained with radiomics features from skin outlines can reliably estimate organ doses from chest CT scans. The proposed method is applicable across different institutions, and cross-institutional models enhance predictive accuracy, generality, and robustness.},

They offer promising advantages, namely, a high dynamic range, low latency, and minimal motion blur. Modern computer vision algorithms often rely on artificial neural network approaches, which require image-like representations of the data and cannot fully exploit the characteristics of event data. Herein, approaches to action recognition based on the Fourier transform are proposed. The approaches are intended to recognize oscillating motion patterns commonly present in nature. In particular, the approaches are applied to a recent dataset of breeding penguins annotated for “ecstatic display,” a behavior where the observed penguins flap their wings at a certain frequency. It is found that the approaches are both simple and effective, producing slightly lower results than a deep neural network (DNN) while relying just on a tiny fraction of the parameters compared to the DNN (five orders of magnitude fewer parameters). They work well despite the uncontrolled, diverse data present in the dataset. It is hoped that this work opens a new perspective on event-based processing and action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Online learning aims to solve a sequence of consecutive prediction tasks by leveraging the knowledge gained from previous tasks. Linearized confidence-weighted (LCW) learning is the first online learning algorithm introducing the concept of weight confidence into the prediction model through distributions over weights. It provides the flexibility for weights to update their values at different scales. The kernel trick in machine learning can be applied to LCW for a better prediction performance. However, the kernel-based LCW algorithm is subject to the curse of kernelization which makes it vulnerable to the unlimited growth of the prediction model in runtime and memory consumption. In this study, we present the budgeted LCW (BLCW) algorithm which puts a limit on the growth by a predefined budget with optimization. Consequently, BLCW performs the LCW update and then reduces the information loss by projection. Based on the resource perspective that reinterprets LCW in terms of resources and utilization degrees, we demonstrated that BLCW approximates the kernel-based LCW algorithm. We evaluate four budget maintenance strategies and suggest that the mean removal is the most stable. By various numerical experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that BLCW performs competitively and effectively when compared to leading budgeted online algorithms.},

To investigate if artificial muscles can mimic (i.e. biomimetic) the complete mechanical state spectrum of biological muscles, this study uses a novel method to characterize twisted coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) mechanically. Thus, comprehensive and reproducible test procedures are established to verify artificial muscle biomimetics regarding stress, strain, and strain rate combinations intrinsic to biological muscle. A rheometer performs novel high-precision mechanical characterization methods to comprehensively verify biomimetic performance. Sample twist level, torque, length, force, and temperature are controlled and measured during twist-induced coiling, heatsetting/annealing, and mechanical testing. TCPAs are formed from linear low-density polyethylene monofilament. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) TCPAs generate larger stresses than biological muscle through the entire spectrum of strains—contracting more than 40%, exerting more than 0.3 MPa at rest length, and withstanding tension of 8 MPa without damage. Thus, the LLDPE TCPAs attain biological muscle performance statically, but additional tests are required to assess this dynamically. The mechanical performance of LLDPE TCPAs enables biomimetic actuation with an intelligent control and measurement system. Their high-throughput textile manufacturability positions them for advanced biomechatronic applications—including prosthetics and exoskeletons.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance controller designed to enhance the performance of coupled human–robot systems during motion. The controller integrates the biomechanical characteristics of human limbs and dynamically adjusts the robotic impedance parameters—specifically damping, stiffness, and equilibrium trajectory—based on real-time estimations of the user&#39;s intent and direction of motion. The primary goal is to minimize the energy expenditure of the coupled human–robot system while maintaining system passivity. To address uncertainties in human behavior and noisy observations, the controller employs Bayesian optimization combined with a Gaussian process. To validate the proposed approach, human experiments are conducted using a standard robotic arm manipulator. The results demonstrate that the controller eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, a process that is typically time-consuming. A comparative analysis against two variable impedance controllers without user-adaptive parameter adjustments reveal significant benefits, with the controller improving combined performance metrics—such as accuracy, speed, user effort, and smoothness—by over 13%. Notably, all participants in the study preferred the optimized controller over the alternatives. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the biomechanics-based, user-adaptive variable impedance control approach and its potential to enhance physical human–robot interaction in various applications that involve repetitive or continuous motion.},

Carnivorous plants feed by trapping insects, sunflowers grow by following the sun, and pine cones control the dispersal of their seeds under optimal conditions. This comprehensive review first analyses the mechanisms responsible for these adaptive movements highlighting the need for a gradient in one of the physico-chemical properties to enable morphing. Next, the main synthetic shape-changing soft systems are presented in terms of their mechanism of action. A gradient in water-swelling, magneto-rheological properties, residual deformation, or extensibility gives hygromorphs, magnetomorphs, mechanomorphs, and baromorphs, respectively. The various morphing triggers, namely light, heat, pH, tensile stress, pressure, electric, and magnetic fields, are described. The opportunities and challenges of each system are put into perspective. This report aims to provide the reader with a toolbox for designing shape-changing materials considering the targeted trigger, as well as providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms paving the way for future discoveries.},

  abstract     = {The robotic manipulation of deformable linear objects is a frontier problem with many potential applications in diverse industries. However, most existing research in this area focuses on shape control for a provided explicit goal and does not consider physical constraints, which limits its applicability in many real-world scenarios. In this study, a self-supervised planning and control approach are proposed to address the challenge of rearranging deformable linear objects for implicit goals. Specifically, the context of making both ends of the object reachable (inside the robotic access range) and graspable (outside potential collision regions) by dual-arm robots is considered. Firstly, the object is described with sequential keypoints and the correspondence-based action is parameterized. Secondly, a generator capable of producing multiple explicit targets is developed, which adhere to implicit conditions. Thirdly, value models are learnt to assign the most promising explicit target as guidance and determine the goal-conditioned action. All models within the policy are trained in a self-supervised manner based on data collected from simulations. Importantly, the learned policy can be directly applied to real-world settings since we do not rely on accurate dynamic models. The performance of the new method is validated with simulations and real-world experiments.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel 3-axis Halbach permanent magnet elastomer (H-PME) sensor for the robotic application, which effectively reduces crosstalk along when two sensors are used simultaneously in close proximity, for example, during grasping of thin and delicate objects, needle threading, etc. This sensor integrates a Halbach-array magnetic elastomer, a 3×3 Hall sensor matrix, and a silicone layer. The magnetic elastomer is produced by combining NdFeB powders with a diameter of 5 μm into silicone, following a weight ratio of 50%, and then magnetized using 2D Halbach-array magnets. Simulation results reveal the capability to adjust magnetic field strength and distribution by altering the magnet&#39;s orientation. The sensor&#39;s efficacy in 3-axis sensing is validated through calibration with a linear model, achieving a good root-mean-square error below 0.7 N in force measurement. The H-PME sensor, with a thickness of merely 4.5 mm, can detect forces up to 50 N. It&#39;s simple 3-layer design allows the thickness to be reduced to as low as 2 mm, while also offering ease of replacement. Crucially, crosstalk evaluation experiments show that the proposed H-PME sensor can dramatically mitigate crosstalk interference.},

Herein, a novel autonomous robotic ultrathin laser-scribed microheater is presented as a safe, efficient, and cost-effective alternative for insect control. A microheater is fabricated using an array of laser-scribed micro-wires and an autonomous robotic module, allowing for rapid and uniform heat transfer in less than 3 s. The integrated robotic microheater successfully (100%) eradicates household ants at 60 °C within 30 s. Such results significantly advance insect control, reducing treatment time from hours to seconds while attenuating chemical insecticides’ critical safety and health risks.

One critical problem that restricts their industrial application is the lack of scalable fabrication techniques due to the limitation of conventional machine tools. This study proposes a scalable surface texturing technique using a portable small (30 × 19 × 22 mm) three-leg robot that walks and works on the workpiece surface. Due to the elliptical tool vibration, microgrooves can be created on the workpiece surface periodically; meanwhile, the machining force drives the robot to walk forward. Surface texturing experiments are conducted on aluminum and copper workpieces to explore the machining performance of the small robot. The robot can reach a maximum moving velocity of 6.3 mm s −1 and can produce microstructures with a spacing of 4–14 μm on workpiece surfaces. Owing to its unique working principle, the small robot can maintain a constant depth of cut, demonstrating its capacity to adapt to the surface waviness of the workpiece. Finally, the motion straightness of the robot is greatly improved by combining it with the auxiliary track, and multiline microstructures are obtained. In short, the developed small robot presents a promising solution to the challenge of scalable surface texturing.},

In this paper, with the goal of establishing the validity and acceptability of modern high-tech medical devices that generate functional data, we focus on the problem of assessing agreement of multiple functional data that are measured on the same subjects by different methods/technologies/raters. Specifically, we introduce a series of unscaled indices, total deviation index (TDI) and coverage probability (CP), that themselves are functions of time and can delineate the trends of intramethod, intermethod, and total (intra+inter) agreement of functional data across time in terms of the original measurement scale. We also develop scalar-valued TDI and CP indices that summarize the degree of agreement over the entire domain based on the weighted average idea. We advocate an experimental design under which each of the two methods generates replicated functional data measurements for each subject, and express each index using a mean function and variance components of a bivariate multilevel functional linear mixed effects model. Such a formulation allows us to smoothly estimate the indices based on our bivariate multilevel functional principal component analysis approach that only requires eigenanalyses of univariate covariance functions for better efficiency and scalability. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to examine the finite-sample properties of the estimators. The proposed method is applied to assess the reliability and reproducibility of renogram curves generated by diuresis renography, a high-tech medical imaging device widely used to detect kidney obstruction.},

  abstract     = {Recurrent events, for example, hospitalizations or drug prescriptions, are common in time-to-event research. One useful summary measure of the recurrent event process is the mean number of events. Methods for estimating the mean number of events exist and are readily implemented for situations in which the recurrent event is the only possible outcome. However, estimation gets more challenging in the competing risk setting, in which methods are so far limited to nonparametric approaches. To this end, we propose a postestimation command for estimating the mean number of events in the presence of competing risks by jointly modeling the intensity function of the recurrent event and the survival function for the competing events. The proposed method is implemented in the R-package JointFPM which is available on CRAN. Simulations demonstrate low bias and good coverage in scenarios where the intensity of the recurrent event does not depend on the number of previous events. We illustrate our method using data on readmissions after colorectal cancer surgery included in the frailtypack package for R. Estimates of the mean number of events can be used to augment time-to-event analyses when both recurrent and competing events exist. The proposed parametric approach offers estimation of a smooth function across time as well as easy estimation of different contrasts which is not available using a nonparametric approach.},

The availability of individual participant data (IPD) makes it possible to evaluate treatment effect moderation and to draw inferences about treatment effects by taking the full utilization of individual covariates from multiple clinical trials. In IPD-NMA, restricted mean survival time (RMST) models have gained popularity when analyzing time-to-event outcomes because RMST models offer more straightforward interpretations of treatment effects with fewer assumptions than hazard ratios commonly estimated from Cox models. Existing approaches estimate RMST within each study and then combine by using aggregate-level NMA methods. However, these methods cannot incorporate individual covariates to evaluate the effect moderation. In this paper, we propose advanced RMST NMA models when IPD are available. Our models allow us to study treatment effect moderation and provide a comprehensive understanding about comparative effectiveness of treatments and subgroup effects. The methods are evaluated by an extensive simulation study and illustrated using a real NMA example about treatments for patients with atrial fibrillation.},

  abstract     = {Variable selection is an important step in the analysis of high-dimensional data, yet there are limited options for survival outcomes in the presence of competing risks. Commonly employed penalized Cox regression considers each event type separately through cause-specific models, neglecting possibly shared information between them. We adapt the feature-weighted elastic net (fwelnet), an elastic net generalization, to survival outcomes and competing risks. For two causes, our proposed algorithm fits two alternating cause-specific models, where each model receives the coefficient vector of the complementary model as prior information. We dub this “cooperative penalized regression,” as it enables the modeling of competing risk data with cause-specific models while accounting for shared effects between causes. Coefficients that are shrunken toward zero in the model for the first cause will receive larger penalization weights in the model for the second cause and vice versa. Through multiple iterations, this process ensures stronger penalization of uninformative predictors in both models. We demonstrate our method&#39;s variable selection capabilities on simulated genomics data and apply it to bladder cancer microarray data. We evaluate selection performance using the positive predictive value for the correct selection of informative features and the false positive rate for the selection of uninformative variables. The benchmark compares results with cause-specific penalized Cox regression, random survival forests, and likelihood-boosted Cox regression. Results indicate that our approach is more effective at selecting informative features and removing uninformative features.

Ignoring measurement errors may lead to misleading inference results. Furthermore, the current identification results of causal effects under the additive hazards model are limited to the scenario with no exposure–mediator interaction, which can be unappealing in mediation analysis. In this paper, we derive the identification results of direct and indirect effects under the additive hazards model in the presence of exposure–mediator interaction.

  abstract     = {Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) approaches for meta-analysis have been developed to relax distributional assumptions and handle the heterogeneity of random effects distributions. These models account for possible clustering and multimodality of the random effects distribution. However, when we combine studies of varying quality, the resulting posterior is not only a combination of the results of interest but also factors threatening the integrity of the studies&#39; results. We refer to these factors as the studies&#39; internal validity biases (e.g., reporting bias, data quality, and patient selection bias). In this paper, we introduce a new meta-analysis model called the bias-corrected Bayesian nonparametric (BC-BNP) model, which aims to automatically correct for internal validity bias in meta-analysis by only using the reported effects and their standard errors. The BC-BNP model is based on a mixture of a parametric random effects distribution, which represents the model of interest, and a BNP model for the bias component. This model relaxes the parametric assumptions of the bias distribution of the model introduced by Verde. Using simulated data sets, we evaluate the BC-BNP model and illustrate its applications with two real case studies. Our results show several potential advantages of the BC-BNP model: (1) It can detect bias when present while producing results similar to a simple normal–normal random effects model when bias is absent. (2) Relaxing the parametric assumptions of the bias component does not affect the model of interest and yields consistent results with the model of Verde. (3) In some applications, a BNP model of bias offers a better understanding of the studies&#39; biases by clustering studies with similar biases. We implemented the BC-BNP model in the R package jarbes, facilitating its practical application.},

  abstract     = {Correct measurement results from in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices (MD) are crucial for optimal patient care. The performance of IVD-MDs is often assessed through method comparison studies. Such studies can be compromised by the influence of various factors. The effect of these factors must be examined in every method comparison study, for example, nonselectivity differences between compared IVD-MDs are examined. Historically, selectivity or nonselectivity has been defined as a qualitative term. However, a quantification of nonselectivity differences between IVD-MDs is needed. This paper fills this need by introducing a novel measure for quantifying differences in nonselectivity (DINS) between a pair of IVD-MDs. Assuming one of the IVD-MDs involved in the comparison exhibits high selectivity for the analyte, it becomes feasible to quantify nonselectivity in the other IVD-MD by employing this DINS measure. Our approach leverages elements from univariate ordinary least squares regression and incorporates repeatability IVD-MD variances, resulting in a normalized measure. We also introduce a plug-in estimator for this measure, which is notably linked to the average relative increase in prediction interval widths attributable to DINS. This connection is exploited to establish a criterion for identifying excessive DINS utilizing a proof-of-hazard approach. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate how the estimator relates to population characteristics like DINS and heteroskedasticity. We find that DINS impacts the mean, variance, and 99th percentile of the estimator, while heteroskedasticity affects only the latter two, and to a considerably smaller extent compared to DINS. Importantly, the size of the study design modulates these effects. We also confirm, when using clinical data, that DINS between pairs of IVD-MDs influence the estimator correspondingly to those of simulated data. Thus, the proposed estimator serves as an effective metric for quantifying DINS between IVD-MDs and helping to determine the quality of a method comparison study.},

  abstract     = {Despite the extensive use of network autocorrelation models in social network analysis, network autocorrelation models for binary dependent variables have received surprisingly scant attention. In this paper, we develop four network autocorrelation models for a binary random variable defined by whether the peer effect (also termed social influence or contagion) acts on latent continuous outcomes leading to an indirect effect under a normal or a logistic distribution or on the probability of the observed outcome itself under a probit or a logit link function defining a direct effect to account for interdependence between outcomes. For all models, we use a Bayesian approach for model estimation under a uniform prior on a transformed peer effect parameter ( ) designed to enhance model computation and compare results to those under the uniform prior for . We use simulation to assess the performance of Bayesian point and interval estimators for each of the four models when the model that generated the data is used for estimation (precision assessment) and when each of the other three models instead generated the data (robustness assessment). We construct a United States New England region patient-sharing hospital network and apply the four network autocorrelation models to study the adoption of robotic surgery, a new medical technology, among hospitals using a cohort of United States Medicare beneficiaries in 2016 and 2017. Finally, we develop a deviance information criterion for each of the four models to compare their fit to the observed data and use posterior predictive p -values to assess the models&#39; ability to recover specified features of the data. The results find that although the indirect peer effect of the propensity of peer hospital adoption on that of the focal hospital is positive under both latent response autocorrelation models, the direct peer effect of the peer hospital&#39;s probability of adopting robotic surgery on the probability of the focal hospital adopting robotic surgery decreases under both mean autocorrelation data models. However, neither of these associations is statistically significant.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel method to adjust for unmeasured time-stable confounding when the time between consecutive treatment administrations is fixed. We achieve this by focusing on a new-user cohort. Furthermore, we envisage that all time-stable confounding goes through the potential time on treatment as dictated by the disease condition at the initiation of treatment. Following this logic, we may eliminate all unmeasured time-stable confounding by adjusting for the potential time on treatment. A challenge with this approach is that right censoring of the potential time on treatment occurs when treatment is terminated at the time of the event of interest, for example, if the event of interest is death. We show how this challenge may be solved by means of the expectation-maximization algorithm without imposing any further assumptions on the distribution of the potential time on treatment. The usefulness of the methodology is illustrated in a simulation study. We also apply the methodology to investigate the effect of depression/anxiety drugs on subsequent poisoning by other medications in the Danish population by means of national registries. We find a protective effect of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the risk of poisoning by various medications (1- year risk difference of approximately ) and a standard Cox model analysis shows a harming effect (1-year risk difference of approximately ), which is consistent with what we would expect due to confounding by indication. Unmeasured time-stable confounding can be entirely adjusted for when the time between consecutive treatment administrations is fixed.},

This paper focuses on finding the required sample size to achieve a desired level of statistical power when treatments are continued to be tested even after a superior treatment has already been found. This may be of interest if there are treatments from different sponsors which are also superior to the current control or multiple doses being tested. The calculations to determine the expected sample size is given. A motivating trial is presented in which the sample size of different configurations is studied. In addition, the approach is compared to running multiple separate trials and it is shown that in many scenarios if family-wise error rate control is needed there may not be benefit in using a platform trial when comparing the sample size of the trial.},

We generally evaluate it on baseline covariates, but rarely on longitudinal ones prior to a management decision. We could use pointwise standardized mean differences, standardized differences of slopes, or weights from the model for such purpose. Pointwise differences could be cumbersome for densely sampled longitudinal markers and/or measured at different points. Slopes are suitable for linear or transformable models but not for more complex curves. Weights do not identify the specific covariate(s) responsible for imbalances. This work presents the Fréchet distance as a viable alternative to assess balance of time-dependent covariates. A set of linear and nonlinear curves for which their standardized difference or differences in functional parameters were within 10% sought to identify the Fréchet distance equivalent to this threshold. This threshold is dependent on the level of noise present and thus within group heterogeneity and error variance are needed for its interpretation. Applied to a set of real curves representing the monthly trajectory of hemoglobin A1c from diabetic patients showed that the curves in the two groups were not balanced at the 10% mark. A Beta distribution represents the Fréchet distance distribution reasonably well in most scenarios. This assessment of covariate balance provides the following advantages: It can handle curves of different lengths, shapes, and arbitrary time points. Future work includes examining the utility of this measure under within-series missingness, within-group heterogeneity, its comparison with other approaches, and asymptotics.},

  abstract     = {In a longitudinal clinical registry, different measurement instruments might have been used for assessing individuals at different time points. To combine them, we investigate deep learning techniques for obtaining a joint latent representation, to which the items of different measurement instruments are mapped. This corresponds to domain adaptation, an established concept in computer science for image data. Using the proposed approach as an example, we evaluate the potential of domain adaptation in a longitudinal cohort setting with a rather small number of time points, motivated by an application with different motor function measurement instruments in a registry of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients. There, we model trajectories in the latent representation by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where person-specific ODE parameters are inferred from baseline characteristics. The goodness of fit and complexity of the ODE solutions then allow to judge the measurement instrument mappings. We subsequently explore how alignment can be improved by incorporating corresponding penalty terms into model fitting. To systematically investigate the effect of differences between measurement instruments, we consider several scenarios based on modified SMA data, including scenarios where a mapping should be feasible in principle and scenarios where no perfect mapping is available. While misalignment increases in more complex scenarios, some structure is still recovered, even if the availability of measurement instruments depends on patient state. A reasonable mapping is feasible also in the more complex real SMA data set. These results indicate that domain adaptation might be more generally useful in statistical modeling for longitudinal registry data.},

Double truncation, which may appear with other sampling designs too, induces a selection bias, so ordinary statistical methods are generally inconsistent. In this paper, we introduce goodness-of-fit procedures for a regression model when the response variable is doubly truncated. With this purpose, a marked empirical process based on weighted residuals is constructed and its weak convergence is established. Kolmogorov–Smirnov– and Cramér–von Mises–type tests are consequently derived from such core process, and a bootstrap approximation for their practical implementation is given. The performance of the proposed tests is investigated through simulations. An application to model selection for AIDS incubation time as depending on age at infection is provided.},

Several methods to analyze data with informative cluster sizes have been proposed; however, methods to test the informativeness of the cluster sizes are limited, particularly for the marginal model. In this paper, we propose a score test and a Wald test to examine the informativeness of the cluster sizes for a generalized linear model, a Cox model, and a proportional subdistribution hazards model. Statistical inference can be conducted through weighted estimating equations. The simulation results show that both tests control Type I error rates well, but the score test has higher power than the Wald test for right-censored data while the power of the Wald test is generally higher than the score test for the binary outcome.

  abstract     = {When planning an oncology clinical trial, the usual approach is to assume proportional hazards and even an exponential distribution for time-to-event endpoints. Often, besides the gold-standard endpoint overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) is considered as a second confirmatory endpoint. We use a survival multistate model to jointly model these two endpoints and find that neither exponential distribution nor proportional hazards will typically hold for both endpoints simultaneously. The multistate model provides a stochastic process approach to model the dependency of such endpoints neither requiring latent failure times nor explicit dependency modeling such as copulae. We use the multistate model framework to simulate clinical trials with endpoints OS and PFS and show how design planning questions can be answered using this approach. In particular, nonproportional hazards for at least one of the endpoints are a consequence of OS and PFS being dependent and are naturally modeled to improve planning. We then illustrate how clinical trial design can be based on simulations from a multistate model. Key applications are coprimary endpoints and group-sequential designs. Simulations for these applications show that the standard simplifying approach may very well lead to underpowered or overpowered clinical trials. Our approach is quite general and can be extended to more complex trial designs, further endpoints, and other therapeutic areas. An R package is available on CRAN.},

  abstract     = {Gene set analysis, a popular approach for analyzing high-throughput gene expression data, aims to identify sets of genes that show enriched expression patterns between two conditions. In addition to the multitude of methods available for this task, users are typically left with many options when creating the required input and specifying the internal parameters of the chosen method. This flexibility can lead to uncertainty about the “right” choice, further reinforced by a lack of evidence-based guidance. Especially when their statistical experience is scarce, this uncertainty might entice users to produce preferable results using a “trial-and-error” approach. While it may seem unproblematic at first glance, this practice can be viewed as a form of “cherry-picking” and cause an optimistic bias, rendering the results nonreplicable on independent data. After this problem has attracted a lot of attention in the context of classical hypothesis testing, we now aim to raise awareness of such overoptimism in the different and more complex context of gene set analyses. We mimic a hypothetical researcher who systematically selects the analysis variants yielding their preferred results, thereby considering three distinct goals they might pursue. Using a selection of popular gene set analysis methods, we tweak the results in this way for two frequently used benchmark gene expression data sets. Our study indicates that the potential for overoptimism is particularly high for a group of methods frequently used despite being commonly criticized. We conclude by providing practical recommendations to counter overoptimism in research findings in gene set analysis and beyond.},

  abstract     = {The selection of best variables is a challenging problem in supervised and unsupervised learning, especially in high-dimensional contexts where the number of variables is usually much larger than the number of observations. In this paper, we focus on two multivariate statistical methods: principal components analysis and partial least squares. Both approaches are popular linear dimension-reduction methods with numerous applications in several fields including in genomics, biology, environmental science, and engineering. In particular, these approaches build principal components, new variables that are combinations of all the original variables. A main drawback of principal components is the difficulty to interpret them when the number of variables is large. To define principal components from the most relevant variables, we propose to cast the best subset solution path method into principal component analysis and partial least square frameworks. We offer a new alternative by exploiting a continuous optimization algorithm for best subset solution path. Empirical studies show the efficacy of our approach for providing the best subset solution path. The usage of our algorithm is further exposed through the analysis of two real data sets. The first data set is analyzed using the principle component analysis while the analysis of the second data set is based on partial least square framework.},

  abstract     = {Extracting typical operational scenarios is essential for making flexible decisions in the dispatch of a new power system. A novel deep time series aggregation scheme (DTSAs) is proposed to generate typical operational scenarios, considering the large amount of historical operational snapshot data. Specifically, DTSAs analyse the intrinsic mechanisms of different scheduling operational scenario switching to mathematically represent typical operational scenarios. A Gramian angular summation field-based operational scenario image encoder was designed to convert operational scenario sequences into high-dimensional spaces. This enables DTSAs to fully capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of new power systems using deep feature iterative aggregation models. The encoder also facilitates the generation of typical operational scenarios that conform to historical data distributions while ensuring the integrity of grid operational snapshots. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method extracted new fine-grained power system dispatch schemes and outperformed the latest high-dimensional feature-screening methods. In addition, experiments with different new energy access ratios were conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed method. DTSAs enable dispatchers to master the operation experience of the power system in advance, and actively respond to the dynamic changes of the operation scenarios under the high access rate of new energy.},

Initially, data augmentation mainly involved some simple transformations of images. Later, in order to increase the diversity and complexity of data, more advanced methods appeared and evolved to sophisticated generative models. However, these methods required a mass of computation of training or searching. In this paper, a novel training-free method that utilises the Pre-Trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) model as a data augmentation tool (PTSAM-DA) is proposed to generate the augmented annotations for images. Without the need for training, it obtains prompt boxes from the original annotations and then feeds the boxes to the pre-trained SAM to generate diverse and improved annotations. In this way, annotations are augmented more ingenious than simple manipulations without incurring huge computation for training a data augmentation model. Multiple comparative experiments on three datasets are conducted, including an in-house dataset, ADE20K and COCO2017. On this in-house dataset, namely Agricultural Plot Segmentation Dataset, maximum improvements of 3.77% and 8.92% are gained in two mainstream metrics, mIoU and mAcc, respectively. Consequently, large vision models like SAM are proven to be promising not only in image segmentation but also in data augmentation.},

It is challenging due to the small size of objects, low contrast, touching boundaries, and complex structure of nuclei. Their segmentation and counting play an important role in cancer identification and its grading. In this study, WaveSeg-UNet, a lightweight model, is introduced to segment cancerous nuclei having touching boundaries. Residual blocks are used for feature extraction. Only one feature extractor block is used in each level of the encoder and decoder. Normally, images degrade quality and lose important information during down-sampling. To overcome this loss, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) alongside max-pooling is used in the down-sampling process. Inverse DWT is used to regenerate original images during up-sampling. In the bottleneck of the proposed model, atrous spatial channel pyramid pooling (ASCPP) is used to extract effective high-level features. The ASCPP is the modified pyramid pooling having atrous layers to increase the area of the receptive field. Spatial and channel-based attention are used to focus on the location and class of the identified objects. Finally, watershed transform is used as a post processing technique to identify and refine touching boundaries of nuclei. Nuclei are identified and counted to facilitate pathologists. The same domain of transfer learning is used to retrain the model for domain adaptability. Results of the proposed model are compared with state-of-the-art models, and it outperformed the existing studies.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz imaging technology has great potential applications in areas, such as remote sensing, navigation, security checks, and so on. However, terahertz images usually have the problems of heavy noises and low resolution. Previous terahertz image denoising methods are mainly based on traditional image processing methods, which have limited denoising effects on the terahertz noise. Existing deep learning-based image denoising methods are mostly used in natural images and easily cause a large amount of detail loss when denoising terahertz images. Here, a residual-learning-based multiscale hybrid-convolution residual network (MHRNet) is proposed for terahertz image denoising, which can remove noises while preserving detail features in terahertz images. Specifically, a multiscale hybrid-convolution residual block (MHRB) is designed to extract rich detail features and local prediction residual noise from terahertz images. Specifically, MHRB is a residual structure composed of a multiscale dilated convolution block, a bottleneck layer, and a multiscale convolution block. MHRNet uses the MHRB and global residual learning to achieve terahertz image denoising. Ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of MHRB. A series of experiments are conducted on the public terahertz image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that MHRNet has an excellent denoising effect on synthetic and real noisy terahertz images. Compared with existing methods, MHRNet achieves comprehensive competitive results.},

At present, the model-based offline policy evaluation (MBOPE) is widely welcomed because of its easy to implement and good performance. MBOPE directly approximates the unknown value of a given policy using the Monte Carlo method given the estimated transition and reward functions of the environment. Usually, multiple models are trained, and then one of them is selected to be used. However, a challenge remains in selecting an appropriate model from those trained for further use. The authors first analyse the upper bound of the difference between the approximated value and the unknown true value. Theoretical results show that this difference is related to the trajectories generated by the given policy on the learnt model and the prediction error of the transition and reward functions at these generated data points. Based on the theoretical results, a new criterion is proposed to tell which trained model is better suited for evaluating the given policy. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed criterion is demonstrated on both benchmark and synthetic offline datasets.},

Medical imaging still faces a number of difficulties, including intra-class similarity, a scarcity of training data, and poor contrast skin lesions, notably in the case of skin cancer. An optimisation-aided deep learning-based system is proposed for accurate multi-class skin lesion identification. The sequential procedures of the proposed system start with preprocessing and end with categorisation. The preprocessing step is where a hybrid contrast enhancement technique is initially proposed for lesion identification with healthy regions. Instead of flipping and rotating data, the outputs from the middle phases of the hybrid enhanced technique are employed for data augmentation in the next step. Next, two pre-trained deep learning models, MobileNetV2 and NasNet Mobile, are trained using deep transfer learning on the upgraded enriched dataset. Later, a dual-threshold serial approach is employed to obtain and combine the features of both models. The next step was the variance-controlled Marine Predator methodology, which the authors proposed as a superior optimisation method. The top features from the fused feature vector are classified using machine learning classifiers. The experimental strategy provided enhanced accuracy of 94.4% using the publicly available dataset HAM10000. Additionally, the proposed framework is evaluated compared to current approaches, with remarkable results.},

  abstract     = {Images with complementary spectral information can be recorded using image sensors that can identify visible and near-infrared spectrum. The fusion of visible and near-infrared (NIR) aims to enhance the quality of images acquired by video monitoring systems for the ease of user observation and data processing. Unfortunately, current fusion algorithms produce artefacts and colour distortion since they cannot make use of spectrum properties and are lacking in information complementarity. Therefore, an information complementarity fusion (ICF) model is designed based on physical signals. In order to separate high-frequency noise from important information in distinct frequency layers, the authors first extracted texture-scale and edge-scale layers using a two-scale filter. Second, the difference map between visible and near-infrared was filtered using the extended-DoG filter to produce the initial visible-NIR complementary weight map. Then, to generate a guide map, the near-infrared image with night adjustment was processed as well. The final complementarity weight map was subsequently derived via an arctanI function mapping using the guide map and the initial weight maps. Finally, fusion images were generated with the complementarity weight maps. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in both avoiding artificial colours as well as effectively utilising information complementarity.},

The ANN model was then used to replace the hybrid framework of the Taguchi method and the GA. The integration of the ANN and FP model makes it a grey-box (GB) model. For the case of Zamama crude, the GB model helped in the decrease of up to 38.93% in energy required per kilo barrel of diesel and an 8.2% increase in diesel production compared to the stand-alone FP model under uncertainty. Similarly, for Kunnar crude, up to 18.87% decrease in energy required per kilo barrel of diesel and a 33.96% increase in diesel production was observed in comparison to the stand-alone FP model.},

  abstract     = {Bilingual lexicon induction focuses on learning word translation pairs, also known as bitexts, from monolingual corpora by establishing a mapping between the source and target embedding spaces. Despite recent advancements, bilingual lexicon induction is limited to inducing bitexts consisting of individual words, lacking the ability to handle semantics-rich phrases. To bridge this gap and support downstream cross-lingual tasks, it is practical to develop a method for bilingual phrase induction that extracts bilingual phrase pairs from monolingual corpora without relying on cross-lingual knowledge. In this paper, the authors propose a novel phrase embedding training method based on the skip-gram structure. Specifically, a local hard negative sampling strategy that utilises negative samples of central tokens in sliding windows to enhance phrase embedding learning is introduced. The proposed method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with exceptional results recorded for distant languages. Additionally, we develop a phrase representation learning method that leverages multilingual pre-trained language models. These mPLMs-based representations can be combined with the above-mentioned static phrase embeddings to further improve the accuracy of the bilingual phrase induction task. We manually construct a dataset of bilingual phrase pairs and integrate it with MUSE to facilitate the bilingual phrase induction task.},

  abstract     = {Efficiently executing inference tasks of deep neural networks on devices with limited resources poses a significant load in IoT systems. To alleviate the load, one innovative method is branching that adds extra layers with classification exits to a pre-trained model, enabling inputs with high-confidence predictions to exit early, thus reducing inference cost. However, branching networks, not originally tailored for IoT environments, are susceptible to noisy and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and they demand additional training for optimal performance. The authors introduce BrevisNet, a novel branching methodology designed for creating on-device branching models that are both resource-adaptive and noise-robust for IoT applications. The method leverages the refined uncertainty estimation capabilities of Dirichlet distributions for classification predictions, combined with the superior OOD detection of energy-based models. The authors propose a unique training approach and thresholding technique that enhances the precision of branch predictions, offering robustness against noise and OOD inputs. The findings demonstrate that BrevisNet surpasses existing branching techniques in training efficiency, accuracy, overall performance, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent sorting is an important prerequisite for the full quantitative consumption and harmless disposal of kitchen waste. The existing object detection method based on an ImageNet pre-trained model is an effective way of sorting. Owing to significant domain gaps between natural images and kitchen waste images, it is difficult to reflect the characteristics of diverse scales and dense distribution in kitchen waste based on an ImageNet pre-trained model, leading to poor generalisation. In this article, the authors propose the first pre-trained model for kitchen waste sorting called KitWaSor, which combines both contrastive learning (CL) and masked image modelling (MIM) through self-supervised learning (SSL). First, to address the issue of diverse scales, the authors propose a mixed masking strategy by introducing an incomplete masking branch based on the original random masking branch. It prevents the complete loss of small-scale objects while avoiding excessive leakage of large-scale object pixels. Second, to address the issue of dense distribution, the authors introduce semantic consistency constraints on the basis of the mixed masking strategy. That is, object semantic reasoning is performed through semantic consistency constraints to compensate for the lack of contextual information. To train KitWaSor, the authors construct the first million-level kitchen waste dataset across seasonal and regional distributions, named KWD-Million. Extensive experiments show that KitWaSor achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the two most relevant downstream tasks for kitchen waste sorting (i.e. image classification and object detection), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed KitWaSor.},

  abstract     = {Images obtained from hyperspectral sensors provide information about the target area that extends beyond the visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, due to sensor limitations and imperfections during the image acquisition and transmission phases, noise is introduced into the acquired image, which can have a negative impact on downstream analyses such as classification, target tracking, and spectral unmixing. Noise in hyperspectral images (HSI) is modelled as a combination from several sources, including Gaussian/impulse noise, stripes, and deadlines. An HSI restoration method for such a mixed noise model is proposed. First , a joint optimisation framework is proposed for recovering hyperspectral data corrupted by mixed Gaussian-impulse noise by estimating both the clean data as well as the sparse/impulse noise levels. Second , a hyper-Laplacian prior is used along both the spatial and spectral dimensions to express sparsity in clean image gradients. Third , to model the sparse nature of impulse noise, an ℓ 1 − norm over the impulse noise gradient is used. Because the proposed methodology employs two distinct priors, the authors refer to it as the hyperspectral dual prior (HySpDualP) denoiser. To the best of authors&#39; knowledge, this joint optimisation framework is the first attempt in this direction. To handle the non-smooth and non-convex nature of the general ℓp − norm-based regularisation term, a generalised shrinkage/thresholding (GST) solver is employed. Finally , an efficient split-Bregman approach is used to solve the resulting optimisation problem. Experimental results on synthetic data and real HSI datacube obtained from hyperspectral sensors demonstrate that the authors’ proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both visually and in terms of various image quality assessment metrics.},

  abstract     = {Real-world data always exhibit an imbalanced and long-tailed distribution, which leads to poor performance for neural network-based classification. Existing methods mainly tackle this problem by reweighting the loss function or rebalancing the classifier. However, one crucial aspect overlooked by previous research studies is the imbalanced feature space problem caused by the imbalanced angle distribution. In this paper, the authors shed light on the significance of the angle distribution in achieving a balanced feature space, which is essential for improving model performance under long-tailed distributions. Nevertheless, it is challenging to effectively balance both the classifier norms and angle distribution due to problems such as the low feature norm. To tackle these challenges, the authors first thoroughly analyse the classifier and feature space by decoupling the classification logits into three key components: classifier norm (i.e. the magnitude of the classifier vector), feature norm (i.e. the magnitude of the feature vector), and cosine similarity between the classifier vector and feature vector. In this way, the authors analyse the change of each component in the training process and reveal three critical problems that should be solved, that is, the imbalanced angle distribution, the lack of feature discrimination, and the low feature norm. Drawing from this analysis, the authors propose a novel loss function that incorporates hyperspherical uniformity, additive angular margin, and feature norm regularisation. Each component of the loss function addresses a specific problem and synergistically contributes to achieving a balanced classifier and feature space. The authors conduct extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. The experimental results demonstrate that the authors’ loss function outperforms several previous state-of-the-art methods in addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced and long-tailed datasets, that is, by improving upon the best-performing baselines on CIFAR-100-LT by 1.34, 1.41, 1.41 and 1.33, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI), the detrimental influence of noise and distortions on data quality is profound, which has severely affected the following-on analytics and decision-making such as land mapping. This study presents an innovative framework for assessing HSI band quality and reconstructing the low-quality bands, based on the Prophet model. By introducing a comprehensive quality metric to start, the authors approach factors in both spatial and spectral characteristics across local and global scales. This metric effectively captures the intricate noise and distortions inherent in the HSI data. Subsequently, the authors employ the Prophet model to forecast information within the low-quality bands, leveraging insights from neighbouring high-quality bands. To validate the effectiveness of the authors’ proposed model, extensive experiments on three publicly available uncorrected datasets are conducted. In a head-to-head comparison, the framework against six state-of-the-art band reconstruction algorithms including three spectral methods, two spatial-spectral methods and one deep learning method is benchmarked. The authors’ experiments also delve into strategies for band selection based on quality metrics and the quality evaluation of the reconstructed bands. In addition, the authors assess the classification accuracy utilising these reconstructed bands. In various experiments, the results consistently affirm the efficacy of the authors’ method in HSI quality assessment and band reconstruction. Notably, the authors’ approach obviates the need for manually prefiltering of noisy bands. This comprehensive framework holds promise in addressing HSI data quality concerns whilst enhancing the overall utility of HSI.},

To address this limitation, an enhanced car-following algorithm utilising ADRC is proposed, which integrates the improved ESO with a feedback controller. In comparison to the conventional ESO, the enhanced version effectively utilises multi-order estimation and tracking errors. Specifically, it enhances convergence rates by incorporating feedback from higher-order estimation errors and ensures the estimated value converges to the reference value by utilising tracking error feedback. The improved ESO significantly enhances the disturbance rejection performance of ADRC.

We have collected 5856 chest x-ray images that are labeled as either “pneumonia” or “normal” from a public forum. Before applying the DeepPneuNet model, a necessary feature extraction and feature mapping have been done on the input images. Conv2D layers with a 1 × 1 kernel size are followed by ReLU activation functions to make up the model. These layers are in charge of recognizing important patterns and features in the images. A MaxPooling 2D procedure is applied to minimize the spatial size of the feature maps after every two Conv2D layers. The sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function trains the model, and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 is used to optimize it. The DeepPneuNet provides 90.12% accuracy for diagnosis of the Pneumonia infection for a set of real-life test images. With 9,445,586 parameters, the DeepPneuNet model exhibits excellent parameter efficiency. DeepPneuNet is a more lightweight and computationally efficient alternative when compared to the other pre-trained models. We have compared accuracies for predicting Pneumonia diagnosis of our proposed DeepPneuNet model with some state-of-the-art deep learning models. The proposed DeepPneuNet model is more advantageous than the existing state-of-the-art learning models for Pneumonia diagnosis with respect to accuracy, precision, recall, F -score, training parameters, and training execution time.},

Most urologists have failed to train the type of kidney stone identification effectively and it is operator-dependent. Concerning the surgical operation, there is a requirement for accurate as well as adequate detection of stone position in the kidney. Thus, it has made the detection process even more difficult. To overcome the challenging issues, an effective detection model for kidney stones using classifiers. Initially, the input images are collected from the standard resources. Further, the input images are subjected to the adaptive multi-convolutional neural network with attention mechanism (AMC-AM) feature fusion model, in which, the pertinent features are extracted from the three networks: Visual Geometry Group16 (VGG16), Residual Network (ResNet), and Inception net. Thus, the three distinct features are obtained for the feature fusion procedure. Finally, the resultant features are subjected as input to the final layer of CNN. In the proposed network, the model is integrated with the attention mechanism and also the parameter tuning is done by proposing the modified social distance of coronavirus mask protection algorithm (MSD-CMPA). Therefore, the performance is examined using different metrics and compared with other baseline models.

Hence, this article proposes a two-stage platform designed to address these challenges by detecting, classifying, and tracking various consumer-grade UAVs. The tracking efficacy of the proposed system is assessed using a combination of deep learning and Kalman filter techniques.

Moreover, we employ both the Kalman filter and the Extended Kalman filter for the tracking stage, enhancing the system&#39;s robustness and enabling real-time tracking capabilities. To train our detector, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 10,000 records that capture the diverse environmental and behavioural conditions experienced by UAVs during their flight. We then present both visual and analytical results to assess and compare the performance of our detector and tracker.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the algorithm based on review text has been widely used in recommendation systems, which can help mitigate the effect of sparsity in rating data within recommender algorithms. Existing methods typically employ a uniform model for capturing user and item features, but they are limited to the shallow feature level, and the user&#39;s personalized preferences and deep features of the item have not been fully explored, which may affect the relationship between the two representations learned by the model. The deeper relationship between them will affect the prediction results. Consequently, we propose a personalized recommendation method based on the rating matrix and review text denoted PRM-RR, which is used to deeply mine user preferences and item characteristics. In the process of processing the comment text, we employ ALBERT to obtain vector representations for the words present in the review text firstly. Subsequently, taking into account that significant words and reviews bear relevance not solely to the review text but also to the user&#39;s individualized preferences, the proposed personalized attention module synergizes the user&#39;s personalized preference information with the review text vector, thereby engendering an enriched review-based user representation. The fusion of the user&#39;s review representation and rating representation is accomplished through the feature fusion module using cross-modal attention, yielding the final user representation. Lastly, we employ a factorization machine to predict the user&#39;s rating for the item, thereby facilitating the recommendation process. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms the baseline algorithm in all cases, demonstrating that our method effectively improves the performance of recommendations.

  abstract     = {To meet the demands of modern technologies such as 5G, big data, edge computing, precision, and sustainable agriculture, the combination of Internet-of-Things (IoT) with software-defined networking (SDN) known as SD-IoT is suggested to automate the network by leveraging the programmable and centralized SDN interfaces. The previous literature has suggested quality-of-service (QoS) aware flow processing using manual strategies or heuristic algorithms, however, these schemes proposed with white-box approaches do not provide effective results as the network scales or dynamic changes are happening. This article proposes a novel QoS provision strategy using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to calculate the optimal routes autonomously for SD-IoT traffic. To satisfy the different demands of flows in the SD-IoT network the flows are divided into two types. Hence, based on their service demand the routes are generated for them as per service request. The scenario is explained with precision agriculture based on SD-IoT and results are compared with benchmark strategies. A real internet topology is used for the evaluation of results. The results indicated that the proposed method gives improvements for QoS such as delay, throughput, packet loss rate, and jitter compared with benchmark models.},

  abstract     = {Nail-biting (NB) or onychophagia is a compulsive disorder that affects millions of people in both children and adults. It has several health complications and negative social effects. Treatments include surgical interventions, pharmacological medications, or additionally, it can be treated using behavioral modification therapies that utilize positive reinforcement and periodical reminders. Although it is the least invasive, such therapies still depend on manual monitoring and tracking which limits their success. In this work, we propose a novel approach for automatic real-time NB detection and alert on a smartwatch that does not require surgical intervention, medications, or manual habit monitoring. It addresses two key challenges: First, NB actions generate subtle motion patterns at the wrist that lead to a high false-positives (FP) rate even when the hand is not on the face. Second, is the challenge to run power-intensive applications on a power-constrained edge device like a smartwatch. To overcome these challenges, our proposed approach implements a pipeline of three convolutional neural networks (CNN) models instead of a single model. The first two models are small and efficient, designed to detect face-touch (FT) actions and hand movement away (MA) from the face. The third model is a larger and deeper CNN model dedicated to classifying hand actions on the face and detecting NB actions. This separation of tasks addresses the key challenges: decreasing FPs by ensuring NB model is activated only when the hand on the face, and optimizing power usage by ensuring the larger NB model runs only for short periods while the efficient FT model runs most of the time. In addition, this separation of tasks gives more freedom to design, configure, and optimize the three models based on each model task. Lastly, for training the main NB model, this work presents further optimizations including developing NB dataset from start through a dedicated data collection application, applying data augmentation, and utilizing several CNN optimization techniques during training. Results show that the model pipeline approach minimizes FPs significantly compared with the single model for NB detection while improving the overall efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Depression, a prevalent mental disorder in modern society, significantly impacts people&#39;s daily lives. Recently, there have been advancements in developing automated diagnosis models for detecting depression. However, data scarcity, primarily due to privacy concerns, has posed a challenge. Traditional speech features have limitations in representing knowledge for depression diagnosis, and the complexity of deep learning algorithms necessitates substantial data support. Furthermore, existing multimodal methods based on neural networks overlook the heterogeneity gap between different modalities, potentially resulting in redundant information. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal depression detection model based on the Enhanced Cross-Attention (ECA) Mechanism. This model effectively explores text-speech interactions while considering modality heterogeneity. Data scarcity has been mitigated by fine-tuning pre-trained models. Additionally, we design a modal fusion module based on ECA, which emphasizes similarity responses and updates the weight of each modal feature based on the similarity information between modal features. Furthermore, for speech feature extraction, we have reduced the computational complexity of the model by integrating a multi-window self-attention mechanism with the Fourier transform. The proposed model is evaluated on the public dataset, DAIC-WOZ, achieving an accuracy of 80.0% and an average F 1 value improvement of 4.3% compared with relevant methods.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors are prevalent forms of malignant neoplasms that, depending on their type, location, and grade, can significantly reduce life expectancy due to their invasive nature and potential for rapid progression. Accordingly, brain tumors classification is an essential step that allows doctors to perform appropriate treatment. Many studies have been done in the sector of medical image processing by employing computational methods to effectively segment and classify tumors. However, the larger amount of information collected by healthcare images prohibits the manual segmentation process in a reasonable time frame, reducing error measures in healthcare settings. Therefore, automated and efficient techniques for segmentation are crucial. In addition, various visual information, noisy images, occlusion, uneven image textures, confused objects, and other features may impact the process. Therefore, the implementation of deep learning provides remarkable results in medicinal image processing, particularly in the segmentation and classification process. However, conventional deep learning-assisted methods struggle with complex structures and dimensional issues. Thus, this paper develops an effective technique for diagnosing brain tumors. The main aspect of the proposed system is to classify the brain tumor types by segmenting the affected regions of the raw images. This novel approach can be applied for various applications like diagnostic centers, decision-making tools, clinical trials, medical research institutes, disease prognosis, and so on. Initially, the requisite images are collected from standard datasets and further, it is subjected to the segmentation period. In this stage, the Multi-scale and Dilated TransUNet++ (MDTUNet++) model is employed to segment the abnormalities. Further, the segmented images are given into an Adaptive Dilated Dense Residual Attention Network (ADDRAN) to classify the brain tumor types. Here, to optimize the ADDRAN technique&#39;s parameters, an Improved Hermit Crab Optimizer (IHCO) is supported, which increases the accuracy rates of the overall network. Finally, the numerical examination is conducted to guarantee the robustness and usefulness of the designed model by contrasting it with other related techniques. For Dataset 1, the accuracy value attains 93.71 for the proposed work compared to 87.86 for CNN, 90.18 for DenseNet, and 89.56 and 90.96 for RAN and DRAN, respectively. Thus, supremacy has been achieved for the recommended system while detecting the brain tumor types.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, crowdsourcing has developed into a business production paradigm and a distributed problem-solving platform. However, the conventional machine learning models failed to assist both requesters and workers in finding the proper jobs that affect better quality outputs. The traditional large-scale crowdsourcing systems typically involve a lot of microtasks, and it requires more time for a crowdworker to search a work on this platform. Thus, task suggestion methods are more useful. Yet, the traditional approaches do not consider the cold-start issue. To tackle these issues, in this paper, a new recommendation system for crowdsourcing data is implemented utilizing deep learning. Initially, from the standard online sources, the crowdsourced data are accumulated. The novelty of the model is to propose an adaptive residual long short-term memory (ARes-LSTM) that learns the task&#39;s latent factor via the task features rather than the task ID. Here, this network&#39;s parameters are optimized by the fitness-based drawer algorithm (F-DA) to improve the efficacy rates. Further, the suggested ARes-LSTM is adopted to detect the user&#39;s preference score based on the user&#39;s historical behaviors. According to the historical behavior records of the users and task features, the ARes-LSTM provides personalized task recommendations and rectifies the issue of cold-start. From the outcomes, the better accuracy rate of the implemented model is 91.42857. Consequently, the accuracy rate of the traditional techniques such as AOA, TSA, BBRO, and DA is attained as 84.07, 85.42, 87.07, and 90.07. Finally, the simulation of the implemented recommendation system is conducted with various traditional techniques with standard efficiency metrics to show the supremacy of the designed recommendation system. Thus, it is proved that the developed recommendation system for the crowdsourcing data model chooses intended tasks based on individual preferences that can help to enlarge the number of chances to engage in crowdsourcing efforts across a broad range of platforms.},

  abstract     = {Speech enhancement is crucial in many speech processing applications. Recently, researchers have been exploring ways to improve performance by effectively capturing the long-term contextual relationships within speech signals. Using multiple stages of learning, where several deep learning modules are activated one after the other, has been shown to be an effective approach. Recently, the attention mechanism has been explored for improving speech quality, showing significant improvements. The attention modules have been developed to improve CNNs backbone network performance. However, these attention modules often use fully connected (FC) and convolution layers, which increase the model&#39;s parameter count and computational requirements. The present study employs multi-stage learning within the framework of speech enhancement. The proposed study uses a multi-stage structure in which a sequence of Squeeze temporal convolutional modules (STCM) with twice dilation rates comes after a Triple attention block (TAB) at each stage. An estimate is generated at each phase and refined in the subsequent phase. To reintroduce the original information, a feature fusion module (FFM) is inserted at the beginning of each following phase. In the proposed model, the intermediate output can go through several phases of step-by-step improvement by continually unfolding STCMs, which eventually leads to the precise estimation of the spectrum. A TAB is crafted to enhance the model performance, allowing it to concurrently concentrate on areas of interest in the channel, spatial, and time-frequency dimensions. To be more specific, the CSA has two parallel regions combining channel with spatial attention, enabling both the channel dimension and the spatial dimension to be captured simultaneously. Next, the signal can be emphasized as a function of time and frequency by aggregating the feature maps along these dimensions. This improves its capability to model the temporal dependencies of speech signals. Using the VCTK and Librispeech datasets, the proposed speech enhancement system is assessed against state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and yielded better results in terms of PESQ, STOI, CSIG, CBAK, and COVL.},

  abstract     = {The sharing of patient information on an open network has drawn attention to the healthcare system. Security is the primary issue while sharing documents online. Thus, a dual watermarking technique has been developed to improve the security of shared data. The classical watermarking schemes are resilient to many attacks. Protecting the authenticity and copyrights of medical images is essential to prevent duplication, modification, or unauthorized distribution. This paper proposes a robust, novel dual watermarking system for securing healthcare data. Initially, watermarking is performed based on redundant lifting wavelet transform (LWT) and turbo code decomposition for COVID-19 patient images and patient text data. To achieve a high level of authenticity, watermarks in the form of encoded text data and decomposed watermark images are inserted together, and an inverse LWT is used to generate an initial watermarked image. Improve imperceptibility and robustness by incorporating the cover image into the watermarked image. Cross-guided bilateral filtering (CG_BF) improves cover image quality, while the integrated Walsh–Hadamard transform (IWHT) extracts features. The novel adaptive coati optimization (ACO) technique is used to identify the ideal location for the watermarked image in the cover image. To improve security, the watermarked image is dissected using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and encrypted with a chaotic extended logistic system. Finally, the encrypted watermarked image is implanted in the desired place using a novel deep-learning model based on the Hybrid Convolutional Cascaded Capsule Network (HC 3 Net). Thus, the secured watermarked image is obtained, and the watermark and text data are extracted using the decryption and inverse DWT procedure. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using accuracy, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), NC, and other metrics. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 99.26%, which is greater than the existing methods.},

Indeed, numerous experiments have shown that these algorithms are widely used in real-life applications because of their flexibility and efficiency in terms of interpretation and predictions. In this paper, we introduce novel approaches for measuring feature quality and information quantity, called Rényi-Tsallis Monotonic Tree (RTMT), which uses the advantages of Rényi and Tsallis entropies while incorporating monotonicity constraints through an optimisation framework. Moreover, we introduce Mono-CART, a variant of the CART approach adapted for monotonic classification. New decision tree algorithms are designed on the basis of aforementioned entropies while considering the monotonicity constraints within an optimisation system. The experiments conducted using some benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) often involves evaluating or ranking alternatives on multiple attributes, a process that is far from trivial due to flexible preferences and uncertainty in the criteria importance. The recently proposed W eightless, I nterval- B ased A pproach (WIBA) tackles these issues by relying on an ordering of the criteria (according to their relevance) instead of explicit weights and using interval scores to evaluate alternatives. Although originally proposed for selecting solutions of interest in the context of multi-objective and many objective optimization problems, it can be adapted to rank such solutions. However, the robustness of WIBA rankings has not been studied, and sensitivity analysis approaches based on perturbations of the weights cannot be applied. Furthermore, there is no friendly environment for exploring WIBA properties. This paper addresses these gaps by (1) introducing a novel local sensitivity analysis technique to explore how small perturbations in the order of criteria affect rankings, and (2) presenting WIBApp, a freely available visual software tool that implements WIBA features, including the proposed sensitivity analysis. Using a case study on the selection of technical universities, the paper first illustrates WIBA&#39;s flexibility and utility in real-world decision scenarios, enabling decision makers to effectively deal with uncertainty and complexity, and second shows how WIBApp simplifies data management, enhances analysis and facilitates comparisons among rankings. By advancing the theoretical foundations of WIBA and providing a practical implementation, this work contributes to providing decision makers with a robust framework for handling multi-criteria problems, enhancing the reliability of rankings and supporting informed decisions.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a two-stage framework that combines uncertainty reduction and predictive modelling to enhance the accuracy of battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. In the first stage, a simplified fuzzy optimization learning model is introduced to mitigate uncertainty caused by abnormal capacity fluctuations in battery data. The proposed fuzzy model reconstructs degradation data into a consistent downward trend based on mid- and short-term tendencies of the battery, alleviating abnormal variability and improving suitability for predictive modelling. In the second stage, uncertainty arising during the recursive prediction process of a standalone Transformer model was mitigated through the integration of a particle filter. This approach dynamically manages prediction errors using particles, effectively controlling cumulative errors and enhancing the stability and reliability of long-term predictions. This methodology can lead to extended battery life and increased operational reliability through accurate RUL prediction. The proposed methodology is validated through experiments using NASA and CALCE battery datasets, demonstrating superior prediction accuracy and stability compared to conventional approaches by systematically reducing uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {Wind turbine blades (WTB) are critical components of wind energy systems. Operating in harsh environments WTBs face significant challenges, since damage to their leading edge caused by erosion or additive surface roughness can reduce performance, and increase maintenance costs and operational downtime. One approach to detect WTB damage is to use machine learning, but properly designing a predictive system is not trivial. Auto machine learning (AutoML) can be used to simplify the design and implementation of machine learning pipelines. This work presents the first comparison of state-of-the-art AutoML methods, Auto-Sklearn, H2O-DAI and TPOT, to detect erosion and additive roughness in WTBs. The Leading-Edge Erosion Study database is used, which provides measurements of the pressure coefficient along the airfoil under different conditions. This is the first work to combine the pressure coefficient and AutoML systems to detect these types of damage. Results show the viability of using AutoML in this task, with H2O-DAI producing the best results, achieving an accuracy above in many cases. However, statistical analysis shows that a standard classifier can achieve similar performance across all problems considered, based on the Friedman test and the Wilcoxon-Holm post hoc analysis with an significance level. However, AutoML systems perform better as the complexity and difficulty of the problem increases.},

However, existing meta-heuristic algorithms still suffer from several shortcomings, including a poor balance between global and local search, a tendency to converge toward the centre of the solution space, and susceptibility to getting trapped in local optima. To overcome these shortcomings, a novel meta-heuristic algorithm, called artificial orca optimiser (AOO), is proposed based on the unique behaviours of orcas in nature. Within the framework of AOO, the switching factor, guidance phase, and iterative formulas that do not converge toward the centre of the solution space, are designed to enhance the equilibrium between exploration and exploitation, ensure agents the ability to escape from the local optimum, and comprehensively explore the solution space without being limited to the centre of the solution space, thereby increasing the likelihood of finding the global optimal solution. Qualitative, quantitative, scalability, sensitivity, and practical application analyses of the experimental results demonstrate that AOO overcomes the issue of converging to the centre of the solution space, alleviates the problems of poor balance and susceptibility to the local optimum, and exhibits outstanding optimising performance, fast convergence, great scalability, high robustness, and excellent practicality.},

  abstract     = {Driven by the rise of the internet, recent years have witnessed the gradual manifestation of commercial values of online reviews. In movie industry, sentiment analysis serves as the foundation for mining user preferences among diverse and multi-layered audiences, providing insight into the market value of movies. As a representative task, aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to analyse and extract fine-grained sentiment elements and their relations in terms of discussed aspects. Relevant studies, particularly in the realm of deep learning research, face challenges due to insufficient annotated data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a guideline for fine-grained sentiment annotations that defines aspect categories, describes the method for annotating aspect sentiment triplets, either simple or complex and designs a scheme to represent hierarchical labels. Based on this, an ABSA dataset tailored for the movie domain is curated by annotating on 1100 Chinese short reviews acquired from Douban. Applicability of both the annotation guideline and curated data is evaluated through inter-annotator consistency and self-consistency checks, and domain adaptation assessment of e-commerce and healthcare cases. Predictive performance of machine learning models on this dataset shed light on possible applications in more fine-grained sentiment analysis in the movie domain, for example, figuring out the aspects from which to stimulate viewership and influence public opinions, thereby providing substantial support for the movie&#39;s box office performance. Finally, we extended our fine-grained sentiment annotation guideline to the e-commerce and healthcare. Through empirical experimentation, we demonstrated the universality of these guideline across diverse domains.},

  abstract     = {Due to the recent advancements in high-speed networks, underlying hardware computing resources and resource scheduling algorithms, Cloud computing has emerged as a popular computing paradigm globally providing end-user services such as infrastructure, hardware platforms and application tools. Subsequently, the researchers across various domains have integrated different services to facilitate the end users. However, the real issue faced by the cloud infrastructure is the network latency due to the physical dispersion between clients and cloud data centers. According to an estimate, billions of internet of things (IoT) devices are sharing approximately two exabytes of data daily. Such a huge amount of data can affect network performance if the underlying physical system does not expand up to the required levels, leading to performance degradation. To overcome these issues, a new computing paradigm called Fog Computing has emerged in recent years. In this paper, we discuss the recent developments in fog computing with the integration of real-time Healthcare 5.0 technology. Furthermore, we describe the proposed layered architecture and taxonomy of resource management (RM) techniques in fog computing, which consists of energy awareness, scheduling, reliability and scalability. Besides that, our survey covers the three-tier layered architecture, evaluation metrics, real-time application aspects of fog computing and tools providing the implementation of RM techniques in fog computing. Furthermore, the proposed layered architecture of the standard fog framework and different state-of-the-art techniques for utilising the computing resources of fog networks have been covered in this study. Moreover, we include various sensors to demonstrate the fog data offloading example in healthcare 5.0 applications. We also present a thorough discussion on various current and future real-time applications of fog computing. Finally, open challenges and promising future research directions have been identified and discussed in the area of fog-based real-time applications.},

The suggested algorithm considers several parameters that influence the hunting behaviour of lionfish, such as visual acuity, mobility, striking success, and prey swallowing potential. Furthermore, this study examines the influence of the physiological traits of the lionfish and their relationship with environmental factors. The novel search algorithm has shown enhanced performance and efficiency, particularly in scenarios where the integration of visual cues and intricate hunting strategies is vital. The suggested LFS method was evaluated using 20 well-known single-modal and multi-modal mathematical functions to analyse its different characteristics. The LFS method has shown remarkable efficacy in both exploration and exploitation, effectively reducing the likelihood of being trapped in local optima. Additionally, it has a rapid convergence capacity, particularly in the realm of large-scale global optimization. Comparisons were made between the LFS algorithm, and 10 other prominent algorithms mentioned in the literature. The proposed LFS metaheuristic algorithm outperformed the others on almost all of the examined functions, demonstrating a statistically significant advantage. Moreover, the positive results found in three practical optimization situations demonstrate the effectiveness of the LFS in accomplishing problem-solving tasks that have limited and unknown search areas.},

  abstract     = {Driven by rapid urbanisation, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) has experienced a dramatic increase in resource consumption and environmental strain. Investigating the relationships among water, energy and carbon can help balance efficient resource utilisation, environmental conservation and economic growth, while promoting sustainable urban development. This study develops an analytical framework for the water-energy-carbon nexus within the urban eco-transformation. Specifically, this study first illustrates the conceptual model for the interaction among water use, energy consumption and carbon emissions theoretically, then examines the water-energy-carbon dynamics in urbanisation and ecological transition of the BTH region. Furthermore, an empirical analysis was conducted taking Beijing city as the case study area to explore the water-energy-carbon nexus and its decoupling with socio-economic development. Results show rapid urbanisation has significantly increased population and economic scale, exerting substantial pressure on water resources, energy supply and the environment. The study reveals a significant positive interaction between water consumption, electricity consumption and carbon emissions in Beijing, with an inverted U-shaped parabolic relationship between GDP and population. Beijing is expected to decouple economic growth from carbon emissions after 2030 and from water consumption after 2037, reducing resource consumption and carbon emissions while sustaining economic growth. To achieve sustainable development, it is recommended that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region accelerate industrial transformation, enhance water resource efficiency, develop clean energy and improve power system efficiency. This paper provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for decision-making and facilitates ecological urbanisation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.},

The adoption of deep learning and machine learning-based abnormal behaviour detection models enhances the influential detection and real-time security monitoring in crowds. The researchers have remotely evaluated the heart rate based on physiological information to detect abnormal activities in various years. Over the past few years, several progress have been made, and there are still some issues concerning processing time, accuracy, and computational complexity. The developed approaches detects the activities of anomalies like traffic rule violations, riots, fighting, and stampede, in addition, several anomalous entities such as abandoned luggage and weapons at the sensitive place automatically in time. However, the identification of video anomalies methods poses several challenges because of various environmental conditions, the ambiguous nature of the anomaly, lack of proper datasets, and the complex nature of human characteristics. In recent days, there have been only a few devoted surveys associated with deep learning related video anomaly identification as the research domain is in its initial stages. In this review work, the abnormal behaviour analysis models using deep learning are reviewed in depth in for security applications. Based on the traditionally used abnormal behaviour analysis models in crowded scenes, we widely categorised the methods into classification using object tracking, classification using handcrafted extracted features, classification using non-contact heart rate variability and blood pressure, analysing motion patterns from the visual frames, and classification using face images. We also discuss the comparative analysis of the previous methods with respect to datasets, computational infrastructure, and performance measures for both qualitative and quantitative analysis.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new data clustering technique aimed at enhancing the performance of the trainable path-cost algorithm and reducing the computational complexity of data clustering models. The proposed method facilitates the discovery of natural groupings and behaviours, which is crucial for effective coordination in complex environments. It identifies natural groupings within a set of features and detects the best clusters with similar behaviour in the data, overcoming the limitations of traditional state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm utilises a density peak clustering method to determine cluster centers and then extracts features from paths passing through these peak points (centers). These features are used to train the support vector machine (SVM) to predict the labels of other points. The proposed algorithm is enhanced using two key concepts: first, it employs Q-Generalised Extreme Value (Q-GEV) under power normalisation instead of traditional generalised extreme value distributions, thereby increasing modelling flexibility; second, it utilises the random vector functional link (RVFL) network rather than the SVM, which helps avoid overfitting and improves label prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm is evaluated through various experiments, including those on UCI benchmark datasets and real-world data, demonstrating significant improvements across multiple performance metrics, including F1 measure, Jaccard index, purity, and accuracy, highlighting its capability in accurately identifying paths between similar clusters. Its average F1 measure, Jaccard index, purity, and accuracy is measured 76.87%, 56.29%, 80.29%, and 79.64%, respectively.},

The synthesis of findings from publicly available NLP repositories in this review sheds light on the progression of SRL methodologies and their use across various linguistic contexts. The investigation examines the distinct hurdles presented by Indian languages, which are characterised by their morphological complexity and syntactic variability, juxtaposed with the more widely studied English language. Furthermore, we perform an analysis of the impact of sophisticated machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning, on enhancing SRL efficacy across these languages. The review identifies key research gaps and proposes future research pathways to address the complex nature of SRL in multilingual environments.

  abstract     = {Text Summarization (TS) is a technique for condensing lengthy text passages. The objective of text summarization is to make concise and coherent summaries that contain the main ideas from a document. When thinking about a page or watching a video, researchers or readers might imagine an abbreviated version which will just catch important parts only. This paper provides an overview of research work done by different authors on this field. There are numerous machine learning and deep learning-based approaches and methods for implementing text summarization in practice because of several factors like time saving, increased productivity, effective comparative analysis, among others. In this article we explore the concept of text summarization as well as techniques, general framework, applications, evaluation measures within both Indic and Non-Indic scripts. Additionally, the article brings out some related issues between text summarization and other intelligent systems such as script nature datasets architectures latest works, and so forth. Finally, the authors presented the challenges of text summarization, as well as analytical ideas, conclusions, and future directions for text summarization.},

It addresses the significant classification modelling challenges, including (1) the requirements for extensive labelled data and (2) the complex optimisation problem for selection of appropriate temporal windows in the absence of prior knowledge of cultivation calendars. We compare the lightweight Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) classification method with the heavily supervised Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) using high-resolution multispectral optical satellite imagery (3 m/pixel). Our approach integrates effective practical preprocessing steps, including data augmentation and a data-driven optimisation strategy for the temporal window, even in the presence of numerous crop classes. Our findings demonstrate that DTW, despite its lower data demands, can match the performance of CNN-LSTM through our effective preprocessing steps while significantly improving runtime. These results demonstrate that both CNN-LSTM and DTW can achieve deployment-level accuracy and underscore the potential of DTW as a viable alternative to more resource-intensive models. The results also prove the effectiveness of temporal windowing for improving runtime and accuracy of a crop classification study, even with no prior knowledge of planting timeframes.},

Similar to the human learning process with the ability of learning, fusing and accumulating new knowledge acquired at different time steps, continual learning is considered to have high practical significance. Hence, continual learning has been studied in various artificial intelligence tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the recent progress of continual learning in computer vision. In particular, the works are grouped by their representative techniques, including regularisation, knowledge distillation, memory, generative replay, parameter isolation and a combination of the above techniques. For each category of these techniques, both its characteristics and applications in computer vision are presented. At the end of this overview, several subareas, where continuous knowledge accumulation is potentially helpful while continual learning has not been well studied, are discussed.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the 3D point cloud field in recent years, point cloud completion of 3D objects has increasingly attracted researchers&#39; attention. Point cloud data can accurately express the shape information of 3D objects at different resolutions, but the original point clouds collected directly by various 3D scanning equipment are often incomplete and have uneven density. Tactile is one distinctive way to perceive the 3D shape of an object. Tactile point clouds can provide local shape information for unknown areas during completion, which is a valuable complement to the point cloud data acquired with visual devices. In order to effectively improve the effect of point cloud completion using tactile information, the authors propose an innovative tactile-assisted point cloud completion network, TAPCNet. This network is the first neural network customised for the input of tactile point clouds and incomplete point clouds, which can fuse two types of point cloud information in the feature domain. Besides, a new dataset named 3DVT was rebuilt, to fit the proposed network model. Based on the tactile fusion strategy and related modules, multiple comparative experiments were conducted by controlling the quantity of tactile point clouds on the 3DVT dataset. The experimental data illustrates that TAPCNet can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in the benchmark.},

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Although some approaches have begun to investigate the robustness of 3D object detection models, they are currently generating adversarial examples in a white-box setting and there is a lack of research into generating transferable adversarial examples in a black-box setting. In this paper, a non-end-to-end attack algorithm was proposed for LiDAR pipelines that crafts transferable adversarial examples against 3D object detection. Specifically, the method generates adversarial examples by restraining features with high contribution to downstream tasks and amplifying features with low contribution to downstream tasks in the feature space. Extensive experiments validate that the method produces more transferable adversarial point clouds, for example, the method generates adversarial point clouds in the nuScenes dataset that are about 10 and 7 better than the state-of-the-art method on mAP and NDS, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In the field of 3D point cloud classification, transfer-based black-box attack strategies have been explored to address the challenge of limited knowledge about the model in practical scenarios. However, existing approaches typically rely excessively on network structure, resulting in poor transferability of the generated adversarial examples. To address the above problem, the authors propose AEattack , an adversarial attack method capable of generating highly transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, AEattack employs an autoencoder (AE) to extract features from the point cloud data and reconstruct the adversarial point cloud based on these features. Notably, the AE does not require pre-training, and its parameters are jointly optimised using a loss function during the process of generating adversarial point clouds. The method makes the generated adversarial point cloud not overly dependent on the network structure, but more concerned with the data distribution. Moreover, this design endows AEattack with a broader potential for application. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset show that AEattack is capable of generating highly transferable adversarial point clouds, with up to 61.8% improvement in transferability compared to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an upward trend that marine vessels, an important object category in marine monitoring, have gradually become a research focal point in the field of computer vision, such as detection, tracking, and classification. Among them, marine vessel re-identification (Re-ID) emerges as a significant frontier research topics, which not only faces the dual challenge of huge intra-class and small inter-class differences, but also has complex environmental interference in the port monitoring scenarios. To propel advancements in marine vessel Re-ID technology, SwinTransReID, a framework grounded in the Swin Transformer for marine vessel Re-ID, is introduced. Specifically, the project initially encodes the triplet images separately as a sequence of blocks and construct a baseline model leveraging the Swin Transformer, achieving better performance on the Re-ID benchmark dataset in comparison to convolution neural network (CNN)-based approaches. And it introduces side information embedding (SIE) to further enhance the robust feature-learning capabilities of Swin Transformer, thus, integrating non-visual cues (orientation and type of vessel) and other auxiliary information (hull colour) through the insertion of learnable embedding modules. Additionally, the project presents VesselReID-1656, the first annotated large-scale benchmark dataset for vessel Re-ID in real-world ocean surveillance, comprising 135,866 images of 1656 vessels along with 5 orientations, 12 types, and 17 colours. The proposed method achieves 87.1 mAP and 96.1 Rank-1 accuracy on the newly-labelled challenging dataset, which surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.9 mAP regarding to performance. Moreover, extensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SwinTransReID on the person Market-1501 dataset, vehicle VeRi-776 dataset, and Boat Re-ID vessel dataset.},

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian images captured by nonoverlapping visible and infrared cameras. Most existing compensation-based methods try to generate images of missing modality from the other ones. However, the generated images often fail to possess enough quality due to severe discrepancies between different modalities. Moreover, it is generally assumed that person images are roughly aligned during the extraction of part-based local features. However, this does not always hold true, typically when they are cropped via inaccurate pedestrian detectors. To alleviate such problems, the authors propose a novel feature-level compensation and alignment network (FCA-Net) for VI-ReID in this paper, which tries to compensate for the missing modality information on the channel-level and align part-based local features. Specifically, the visible and infrared features of low-level subnetworks are first processed by a channel feature compensation (CFC) module, which enforces the network to learn consistent distribution patterns of channel features, and thereby the cross-modality discrepancy is narrowed. To address spatial misalignment, a pairwise relation module (PRM) is introduced to incorporate human structural information into part-based local features, which can significantly enhance the feature discrimination power. Besides, a cross-modality part alignment loss (CPAL) is designed on the basis of a dynamic part matching algorithm, which can promote more accurate local matching. Extensive experiments on three standard VI-ReID datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that state-of-the-art performance is achieved.},

This systematic literature review examines the cutting-edge technologies in smart agriculture specifically computer vision, robotics, deep learning (DL), and Internet of Things (IoT) that are reshaping plant disease detection and management. By analysing 198 studies published between 2021 and 2023, from an initial pool of 19,838 papers, the authors reveal the dominance of DL, particularly with datasets such as PlantVillage, and highlight critical challenges, including dataset limitations, lack of geographical diversity, and the scarcity of real-world field data.

However, the visual differences between the synthetic and real images pose significant challenges to their practical applications. This work addresses these challenges through synthetic-to-real style transfer leveraging diffusion models. The authors’ proposal incorporates semantic controllers to guide the diffusion process and low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to ensure that style-transferred images align with real-world aesthetics while preserving semantic layout. Moreover, the authors introduce quality metrics to rank the utility of generated images, enabling the selective use of high-quality images for training. To further enhance reliability, the authors propose a novel loss function that mitigates artefacts from the style transfer process by incorporating only pixels aligned with the original semantic labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the authors’ proposal outperforms selected state-of-the-art methods for image generation and UDA training, achieving optimal performance even with a smaller set of high-quality generated images.

The study introduces a cascade adversarial strategy based on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), optimised explicitly for sparse observation trajectories. In the preliminary phase of the CGAN, the U-Net architecture was employed to capture more global information and enhance image detail recovery capability, which is subsequently utilised in the cascade refinement network. The ResNet34 residual network in the advanced network stage was adopted to bolster feature extraction and image generation capabilities further. Based on experimental validation performed on the curated TomoSAR 3D super-resolution dataset tailored for buildings, the findings reveal that the methodology yields a notable enhancement in image quality and accuracy compared to other techniques.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration is a crucial aspect of computer vision and 3D reconstruction. Traditional registration methods often depend on global features or iterative optimisation, leading to inefficiencies and imprecise outcomes when processing complex scene point cloud data. To address these challenges, the authors introduce a principal direction-guided local voxelisation structural feature (PDLVSF) approach for point cloud registration. This method reliably identifies feature points regardless of initial positioning. Approach begins with the 3D Harris algorithm to extract feature points, followed by determining the principal direction within the feature points&#39; radius neighbourhood to ensure rotational invariance. For scale invariance, voxel grid normalisation is utilised to maximise the point cloud&#39;s geometric resolution and make it scale-independent. Cosine similarity is then employed for effective feature matching, identifying corresponding feature point pairs and determining transformation parameters between point clouds. Experimental validations on various datasets, including the real terrain dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Results indicate superior performance in root mean square error (RMSE) and registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high noise, limited overlap, and significant initial pose rotation. The real terrain dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/black-2000/Real-terrain-data .},

  abstract     = {Egocentric action anticipation involves predicting future actions performed by the camera wearer from egocentric video. Although the task has recently gained attention in the research community, current approaches often assume that input videos are ‘trimmed’, meaning that a short video sequence is sampled a fixed time before the beginning of the action. However, trimmed action anticipation has limited applicability in real-world scenarios, where it is crucial to deal with ‘untrimmed’ video inputs and the exact moment of action initiation cannot be assumed at test time. To address these limitations, an untrimmed action anticipation task is proposed, which, akin to temporal action detection, assumes that the input video is untrimmed at test time, while still requiring predictions to be made before actions take place. The authors introduce a benchmark evaluation procedure for methods designed to address this novel task and compare several baselines on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset. Through our experimental evaluation, testing a variety of models, the authors aim to better understand their performance in untrimmed action anticipation. Our results reveal that the performance of current models designed for trimmed action anticipation is limited, emphasising the need for further research in this area.},

Existing blood cell detection methods suffer from low accuracy, which is caused by the uneven distribution, high density, and mutual occlusion of different blood cell types in blood microscope images, this article introduces NBCDC-YOLOv8: a new framework to improve blood cell detection and classification based on YOLOv8. Our framework innovates on several fronts: it uses Mosaic data augmentation to enrich the dataset and add small targets, incorporates a space to depth convolution (SPD-Conv) tailored for cells that are small and have low resolution, and introduces the Multi-Separated and Enhancement Attention Module (MultiSEAM) to enhance feature map resolution. Additionally, it integrates a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) for effective multi-scale feature fusion and includes four detection heads to improve recognition accuracy of various cell sizes, especially small target platelets. Evaluated on the Blood Cell Classification Dataset (BCCD), NBCDC-YOLOv8 obtains a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.7%, and thus surpasses the original YOLOv8n by 2.3%.},

In this paper, the authors investigate a robust classification method that extends the classical paradigm of robust geometric model fitting. The method views an image as a set of points in a low-dimensional space and analyses each image through low-dimensional geometric model fitting. In contrast, the majority of other methods, such as deep learning methods, treat an image as a single point in a high-dimensional space. The authors evaluate the performance of the method using a noisy Omniglot dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly more robust than other methods.

This, together with large image volumes collected using camera traps and crowdsourcing, opens novel possibilities to study animal populations. For many species, the re-identification can be done by analysing the permanent fur, feather, or skin patterns that are unique to each individual. In this paper, the authors study pattern feature aggregation based re-identification and consider two ways of improving accuracy: (1) aggregating pattern image features over multiple images and (2) combining the pattern appearance similarity obtained by feature aggregation and geometric pattern similarity. Aggregation over multiple database images of the same individual allows to obtain more comprehensive and robust descriptors while reducing the computation time. On the other hand, combining the two similarity measures allows to efficiently utilise both the local and global pattern features, providing a general re-identification approach that can be applied to a wide variety of different pattern types. In the experimental part of the work, the authors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising re-identification accuracies for Saimaa ringed seals and whale sharks without species-specific training or fine-tuning.},

Then, the fusion attention-based combination (FABC) module is used to extract multi-level topological structure information of the human body, and effectively fuse topological structure information, geometric size information and trajectory information.

Our key contribution is a dual-branch architecture that separately extracts geometric features from LiDAR and texture features from images. These features are then fused in a BEV perspective to achieve a comprehensive representation of the tracked object. A significant innovation in our approach is the Image-to-LiDAR Adapter module, which transfers the rich feature representation capabilities of the image modality to the 3D tracking task, and the BEV-Fusion module, which facilitates the interactive fusion of geometry and texture features. By validating MILT on public datasets, we demonstrate substantial performance improvements over traditional methods, effectively showcasing the advantages of our multi-modal fusion strategy.

To address these challenges, development of robust algorithmic approach encompassing efficient feature sets and classification model are essential. This study incorporates point-wise features to capture the local spatial context of points in datasets. Furthermore, an ensemble machine learning model based on extreme boosting is utilised, which integrates sequential training for weak learners, to enhance the model’s resilience. To thoroughly investigate the efficacy of the proposed approach, this study utilises three distinct datasets from diverse geographical locations, each presenting unique challenges related to class distribution, 3D terrain intricacies, and geographical variations. The Land-cover Diversity Index is introduced to quantify the complexity of landcover in 3D by measuring the degree of class heterogeneity and the frequency of class variation in the dataset. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 90% on the regionally complex, higher landcover diversity dataset, Trivandrum Aerial LiDAR Dataset. Furthermore, the results of the study demonstrate improved overall predictive accuracy of 91% and 87% on data segments from two benchmark datasets, DALES and Vaihingen 3D.},

To improve the performance of network, the authors introduce a ‘re-encoding’ architecture and a regularisation loss function term, minimising the KL divergence between the distributions of features extracted by the first and second encoders. Unlike the common use of KL divergence loss to obtain a feature distribution close to an already-known distribution, the aim is to encourage the features extracted by the second encoder to have a close distribution to those extracted from the first encoder. The authors evaluate the proposed method on the Epic-Kitchens-55 dataset and conduct an ablation study to analyse the functions of different components. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms the comparison methods in all cases and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed re-encoding architecture and the regularisation term.},

  abstract     = {In ecology, deep learning is improving the performance of camera-trap image based wild animal analysis. However, high labelling cost becomes a big challenge, as it requires involvement of huge human annotation. For example, the Snapshot Serengeti (SS) dataset contains over 900,000 images, while only 322,653 contains valid animals, 68,000 volunteers were recruited to provide image level labels such as species, the no. of animals and five behaviour attributes such as standing, resting and moving etc. In contrast, the Gold Standard SS Bounding-Box Coordinates (GSBBC for short) contains only 4011 images for training of object detection algorithms, as the annotation of bounding-box for animals in the image, is much more costive. Such a no. of training images, is obviously insufficient. To address this, the authors propose a method to generate bounding-boxes for a larger dataset using limited manually labelled images. To achieve this, the authors first train a wild animal detector using a small dataset (e.g. GSBBC) that is manually labelled to locate animals in images; then apply this detector to a bigger dataset (e.g. SS) for bounding-box generation; finally, we remove false detections according to the existing label information of the images. Experiments show that detector trained with images whose bounding-boxes are generated using the proposal, outperformed the existing camera-trap image based animal detection, in terms of mean average precision (mAP). Compared with the traditional data augmentation method, our method improved the mAP by 21.3% and 44.9% for rare species, also alleviating the long-tail issue in data distribution. In addition, detectors trained with the proposed method also achieve promising results when applied to classification and counting tasks, which are commonly required in wildlife research.},

Mainstream approaches encompass rule-based and deep learning-based methods for spatial-temporal relationship modelling. While the former relies on physical motion laws, offering wider applicability but yielding suboptimal results for complex object movements, the latter, though achieving high-performance, lacks interpretability and involves complex module designs. This work aims to simplify deep learning-based spatial-temporal relationship models and introduce interpretability into features for data association. Specifically, a lightweight single-layer transformer encoder is utilised to model spatial-temporal relationships. To make features more interpretative, two contrastive regularisation losses based on representation alignment are proposed, derived from spatial-temporal consistency rules. By applying weighted summation to affinity matrices, the aligned features can seamlessly integrate into the data association stage of the original tracking workflow. Experimental results showcase that our model enhances the majority of existing tracking networks&#39; performance without excessive complexity, with minimal increase in training overhead and nearly negligible computational and storage costs.},

  abstract     = {Camera pose estimation plays a crucial role in computer vision, which is widely used in augmented reality, robotics and autonomous driving. However, previous studies have neglected the presence of outliers in measurements, so that even a small percentage of outliers will significantly degrade precision. In order to deal with outliers, this paper proposes using a graduated non-convexity (GNC) method to suppress outliers in robust camera pose estimation, which serves as the core of GNCPnP. The authors first reformulate the camera pose estimation problem using a non-convex cost, which is less affected by outliers. Then, to apply a non-minimum solver to solve the reformulated problem, the authors use the Black-Rangarajan duality theory to transform it. Finally, to address the dependence of non-convex optimisation on initial values, the GNC method was customised according to the truncated least squares cost. The results of simulation and real experiments show that GNCPnP can effectively handle the interference of outliers and achieve higher accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, the camera pose estimation accuracy of GNCPnP in the case of a low percentage of outliers is almost comparable to that of the state-of-the-art algorithm in the case of no outliers.},

  abstract     = {The accurate detection of moving objects is essential in various applications of artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of intelligent surveillance systems. However, the moving cast shadow detection significantly decreases the precision of moving object detection because they share similar motion characteristics. To address the issue, the authors propose an innovative approach to detect moving cast shadows by combining the hybrid feature with a broad learning system (BLS). The approach involves extracting low-level features from the input and background images based on colour constancy and texture consistency principles that are shown to be highly effective in moving cast shadow detection. The authors then utilise the BLS to create a hybrid feature and BLS uses the extracted low-level features as input instead of the original data. BLS is an innovative form of deep learning that can map input to feature nodes and further enhance them by enhancement nodes, resulting in more compact features for classification. Finally, the authors develop an efficient and straightforward post-processing technique to improve the accuracy of moving object detection. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalisation ability, the authors conduct extensive experiments on public ATON-CVRR and CDnet datasets to verify the superior performance of our method by comparing with representative approaches.},

  abstract     = {Recently, visual-language models (VLMs) have displayed potent capabilities in the field of computer vision. Their emerging trend as the backbone of visual tasks necessitates studying class incremental learning (CIL) issues within the VLM architecture. However, the pre-training data for many VLMs is proprietary, and during the incremental phase, old task data may also raise privacy issues. Moreover, replay-based methods can introduce new problems like class imbalance, the selection of data for replay and a trade-off between replay cost and performance. Therefore, the authors choose the more challenging rehearsal-free settings. In this paper, the authors study class-incremental tasks based on the large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP model. Initially, at the category level, the authors combine traditional optimisation and distillation techniques, utilising both pre-trained models and models trained in previous incremental stages to jointly guide the training of the new model. This paradigm effectively balances the stability and plasticity of the new model, mitigating the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, utilising the VLM infrastructure, the authors redefine the relationship between instances. This allows us to glean fine-grained instance relational information from the a priori knowledge provided during pre-training. The authors supplement this approach with an entropy-balancing method that allows the model to adaptively distribute optimisation weights across training samples. The authors’ experimental results validate that their method, within the framework of VLMs, outperforms traditional CIL methods.},

Its insidious onset, high disability rate, long diagnostic cycle, and high diagnostic costs impose a heavy burden on patients and their families. Leveraging artificial intelligence, with its rapid diagnostic speed, high accuracy, and fatigue resistance, to achieve intelligent assisted diagnosis of PD holds significant promise for alleviating patients&#39; financial stress, reducing diagnostic cycles, and helping patients seize the golden period for early treatment.

  abstract     = {The utilisation of domain adaptation methods facilitates the resolution of classification challenges in an unlabelled target domain by capitalising on the labelled information from source domains. Unfortunately, previous domain adaptation methods have focused mostly on global domain adaptation and have not taken into account class-specific data, which leads to poor knowledge transfer performance. The study of class-level domain adaptation, which aims to precisely match the distributions of different domains, has garnered attention in recent times. However, existing investigations into class-level alignment frequently align domain features either directly on or in close proximity to classification boundaries, resulting in the creation of uncertain samples that could potentially impair classification accuracy. To address the aforementioned problem, we propose a new approach called metric-guided class-level alignment (MCA) as a solution to this problem. Specifically, we employ different metrics to enable the network to acquire supplementary information, thereby enhancing class-level alignment. Moreover, MCA can be effectively combined with existing domain-level alignment methods to successfully mitigate the challenges posed by domain shift. Extensive testing on commonly-used public datasets shows that our method outperforms many other cutting-edge domain adaptation methods, showing significant gains over baseline performance.},

  abstract     = {Video prediction is the process of learning necessary information from historical frames to predict future video frames. Learning features from historical frames is a crucial step in this process. However, most current methods have a relatively single-scale learning approach, even if they learn features at different scales, they cannot fully integrate and utilise them, resulting in unsatisfactory prediction results. To address this issue, a hierarchical multi-scale fusion unit (HMSFU) is proposed. By using a hierarchical multi-scale architecture, each layer predicts future frames at different granularities using different convolutional scales. The abstract features from different layers can be fused, enabling the model not only to capture rich contextual information but also to expand the model&#39;s receptive field, enhance its expressive power, and improve its applicability to complex prediction scenarios. To fully utilise the expanded receptive field, HMSFU incorporates three fusion modules. The first module is the single-layer historical attention fusion module, which uses an attention mechanism to fuse the features from historical frames into the current frame at each layer. The second module is the single-layer spatiotemporal fusion module, which fuses complementary temporal and spatial features at each layer. The third module is the multi-layer spatiotemporal fusion module, which fuses spatiotemporal features from different layers. Additionally, the authors not only focus on the frame-level error using mean squared error loss, but also introduce the novel use of Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence to consider inter-frame variations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed HMSFU model achieves the best performance on popular video prediction datasets, showcasing its remarkable competitiveness in the field.},

Secondly, uneven vessel thickness and irregular distribution further complicate the multi-scale feature modelling. Lastly, low-contrast images lead to increased background noise, further affecting the segmentation accuracy. To tackle these challenges, this article presents a multi-scale segmentation network that combines edge features and attention mechanisms, referred to as EANet. It demonstrates significant advantages over existing methods. Specifically, EANet consists of three key modules: the edge feature enhancement module, the multi-scale information interaction encoding module, and the multi-class attention mechanism decoding module. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the method.

However, there are three essential challenges in the task of tennis ball recognition using sport vision sensors: the small size of the ball, its high speed, and the complex match scenarios. As a result, this paper considers a lightweight object detection model named improved RTMDet-light to deal with these challenges. Specifically, it has compatible capacities in the backbone and neck, constructed by a basic building block that consists of large-kernel depth-wise convolutions. Furthermore, GhosNet and ShuffleNet are used to replace the CSPLayers which reduce the parameters of our model. The lightweight model proposed addresses the inherent challenges of detecting small objects and muti scenarios in the match. After training, the proposed model performed better on four scenarios with different shades of tennis ball match, with results visualized through heatmaps and performance metrics tabulated for detailed analysis. The recall, FLOPs and number of parameters of the improved RTMDet-light are 71.4%, 12.543G, and 4.874M, respectively. The results demonstrate robustness and effectiveness of our model in accurate tennis ball detecting across various scales.

Specifically, the STE module enhances the spatiotemporal representation using a single-channel 3D convolution, enabling the model to focus on both temporal and spatial features. The ME module emphasises motion-sensitive channels by calculating feature map differences at adjacent time steps, guiding the model toward motion-centric regions. The ECE module efficiently captures cross-channel interactions without dimensionality reduction, ensuring robust performance while significantly reducing model complexity. Pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, the proposed method achieved Top-1 accuracy of 49.0% on the Something-Something V1 (Sth-Sth V1) dataset and 40.8% on the Diving48 dataset.

  abstract     = {Current feature matching methods typically employ a two-stage process, consisting of coarse and fine matching. However, the transition from the coarse to the fine stage often lacks an effective intermediate state, leading to abrupt changes in the matching process. This can hinder smooth transitions and precise localization. To address these limitations, this study introduces Coarse-Mid-Fine Match Net (CMFNet), a novel three-stage image feature matching method. CMFNet incorporates an intermediate-grained matching phase between the coarse and fine stages to facilitate a more gradual and seamless transition. In the proposed method, the intermediate-grained matching refines the correspondences obtained from the coarse-grained stage using Adaptive-random sample consensus (RANSAC). Subsequently, the midtransformer, which integrates sparse self-attention (SSA) mechanisms with local-feature-based cross-attention, is employed for feature extraction. This approach enhances the feature extraction capabilities and improves the adaptability to various types of image data, thereby boosting overall matching performance. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism based on local region features is introduced. The network undergoes fully self-supervised training, aiming to minimize a match loss that is autonomously generated from the training data using a multi-scale cross-entropy method. A series of thorough experiments was carried out on diverse real-world datasets, including both unaltered and extensively processed images.The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 0.776 mAUC on the HPatches dataset and 0.442 mAUC on the ISC-HE dataset.},

However, traditional approaches struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including complex boundary delineation and intricate spatial relationships. To address these limitations, we introduce the semantic uncertainty-aware segmentation (SUAS) method, an innovative plug-and-play solution designed specifically for remote sensing image analysis. SUAS builds upon the rotated multi-scale interaction network (RMSIN) architecture and introduces the prompt refinement and uncertainty adjustment module (PRUAM). This novel component transforms original textual prompts into semantic uncertainty-aware descriptions, particularly focusing on the ambiguous boundaries prevalent in remote sensing imagery. By incorporating semantic uncertainty, SUAS directly tackles the inherent complexities in boundary delineation, enabling more refined segmentations. Experimental results demonstrate SUAS&#39;s effectiveness, showing improvements over existing methods across multiple metrics. SUAS achieves consistent enhancements in mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) and precision at various thresholds, with notable performance in handling objects with irregular and complex boundaries—a persistent challenge in aerial imagery analysis. The results indicate that SUAS&#39;s plug-and-play design, which leverages semantic uncertainty to guide the segmentation task, contributes to improved boundary delineation accuracy in remote sensing image analysis.},

  abstract     = {Neural radiation field (NeRF) has been widely used in the field of talking portrait synthesis. However, the inadequate utilisation of audio information and spatial position leads to the inability to generate images with high audio-lip consistency and realism. This paper proposes a novel tri-plane dynamic neural radiation field (Tri-NeRF) that employs an implicit radiation field to study the impacts of audio on facial movements. Specifically, Tri-NeRF propose tri-plane offset network (TPO-Net) to offset spatial positions in three 2D planes guided by audio. This allows for sufficient learning of audio features from image features in a low dimensional state to generate more accurate lip movements. In order to better preserve facial texture details, we innovatively propose a new gated attention fusion module (GAF) to dynamically fuse features based on strong and weak correlation of cross-modal features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that Tri-NeRF can generate talking portraits with audio-lip consistency and realism.},

In high-traffic environments, traditional face recognition methods can cause crowd congestion, emphasizing the need for unconscious face recognition, which requires no active cooperation from individuals. Due to the nature of unconscious face recognition, it is necessary to capture high-quality face images. In this paper, the FSA-Net head pose estimation network is enhanced to FSA-Shared_Nadam by replacing the Adam optimizer with Nadam and improving stage fusion. In the first stage, FSA-Shared_Nadam estimates head pose angles, MediaPipe detects facial landmarks to calculate eye distance and aspect ratios, and sharpness is calculated using the Laplacian operator. Images are considered valid if they meet the criteria. A model trains a face quality scoring formula, learning how different head pose angles affect face recognition accuracy. In the second stage, face images are clustered, and the formula is applied to select the highest-scoring face within each cluster. The approach was tested across multiple datasets, and a simulated security checkpoint scenario was created for practical testing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FSA-Shared_Nadam head pose estimation algorithm and the proposed face quality assessment approach.},

  abstract     = {High-quality retinal fundus images are widely used by ophthalmologists for the detection and diagnosis of eye diseases, diabetes, and hypertension. However, in retinal fundus imaging, the reduction in image quality, characterized by poor local contrast and non-uniform brightness, is inevitable. Image enhancement becomes an essential and practical strategy to address these issues. In this paper, we propose a retinal fundus image enhancement method that emphasizes details and equalizes brightness, based on image decomposition. First, the original image is decomposed into three layers using an edge-preserving filter: a base layer, a detail layer, and a noise layer. Second, an adaptive local power-law approach is applied to the base layer for brightness equalization, while detail enhancement is achieved for the detail layer through saliency analysis and blue channel removal. Finally, the base and detail layers are combined, excluding the noise layer, to synthesize the final image. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with both classical and recent approaches using two widely adopted datasets. According to the experimental results, both subjective and objective assessments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances retinal fundus images by highlighting details, equalizing brightness, and suppressing noise and artifacts, all without causing color distortion.},

Finally, a class feature vector extractor based on meta-learning is provided to reconstruct the feature map by overlaying a class feature vector from the target domain onto the query image.

MFENet introduces a multi-scale feature extraction module (MS-FE) based on depth-wise separable convolutions to capture rich multi-scale spatial and channel information. Furthermore, the proposed method employs a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that utilizes wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics.

However, to further enhance the model&#39;s supervisory signals, we introduce a new feature-based perceptual loss. This module utilizes a pre-trained encoder to extract features from both the synthesized and target frames and calculates their cosine dissimilarity as an additional source of supervision. In this way, we aim to improve the model&#39;s robustness in handling complex lighting and surface reflection conditions in endoscopic scenes. We compare the performance of using two pre-trained CNN-based models and four foundational models as encoder. Experimental results show that our improve method further enhances the accuracy of depth estimation in medical imaging. Additionally, it demonstrates that features extracted by CNN-based models, which are sensitive to local details, outperform foundation models.

However, existing shadow detection methods tend to misidentify complex shadows and their similar patterns, such as soft shadow regions and shadow-like regions, since they treat all cases equally, leading to an incomplete structure of the detected shadow regions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a structure-aware transformer network (STNet) for robust shadow detection. Specifically, we first develop a transformer-based shadow detection network to learn significant contextual information interactions. To this end, a context-aware enhancement (CaE) block is also introduced into the backbone to expand the receptive field, thus enhancing semantic interaction. Then, we design an edge-guided multi-task learning framework to produce intermediate and main predictions with a rich structure. By fusing these two complementary predictions, we can obtain an edge-preserving refined shadow map. Finally, we introduce an auxiliary semantic-aware learning to overcome the interference from complex scenes, which facilitates the model to perceive shadow and non-shadow regions using a semantic affinity loss. By doing these, we can predict high-quality shadow maps in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the balance error rate (BER) by 4.53%, 2.54%, and 3.49% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the benchmark datasets SBU, ISTD, and UCF, respectively.},

For text localization, we explore maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) for detecting components that work by clustering pixels with similar properties. The output of component detection includes several non-text components due to the degradations of social media images. To select the best components among many, we explore the genetic algorithm by convolving different kernels with components, which results in a feature matrix that is further fed to EfficientNet for choosing actual text components. Therefore, the proposed model is called genetic algorithm based network for text localization in degraded social media images (TLDSMI). For evaluating text localization, we consider the images of the standard dataset of natural scenes by uploading and downloading from different social media platforms, namely, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Instagram. The effectiveness of our method is shown by testing on original and degraded standard datasets. For example, for the degraded images of different complexities including degradations caused by social media platforms, the proposed method performs well in almost all situations.

Among the various attack types, spoofing attack poses a significant threat due to high success rates and minimal technical requirements. In this study, we explore the differences between real and fake palmprint images. Based on these differences, we propose the concept of ‘high-frequency spoofing regions’ to capture key discriminative spoofing clues. Specifically, the high-frequency spoofing regions adaptation ( HFSRA ) model is proposed to address palmprint anti-spoofing. The HFSRA consists of two key modules: the texture analysis module (TAM) and the spoofing attention module (SAM). In particular, the TAM divides the input feature map into several patches and evaluates the texture distribution within each patch. Next, the SAM dynamically constructs an attention map by mapping the texture distribution to an attention weight matrix. This adaptive structure forces the model to focus on high-frequency spoofing regions, which improves the model&#39;s ability to extract meaningful spoofing clues effectively. Furthermore, we establish three experimental protocols for evaluating the performance of palmprint anti-spoofing models. These protocols provide a standardized evaluation framework for future studies. Extensive experiments conducted under these protocols demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of HFSRA.},

  abstract     = {Super-resolution techniques play an important role in the fields of image processing and computer vision. However, existing super-resolution methods based on generative adversarial networks still exhibit significant shortcomings in recovering high-frequency details and effectively utilising multi-scale information. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved generative adversarial network. Specifically, an enhanced multi-scale Laplacian pyramid structure is designed to capture and process image details at different scales. Then, convolutional operations are added to each layer of the pyramid to further improve the recovery of multi-scale details. Additionally, a frequency domain loss is introduced, where the generated and real images are transformed into the frequency domain using Fourier transforms for comparison. This method enhances the reconstruction of high-frequency details. The experiments are validated on four publicly available datasets and the results show that the proposed network significantly outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and visual performance.},

  abstract     = {Object detection models are widely applied in the fields such as video surveillance and unmanned aerial vehicles to enable the identification and monitoring of various objects on a diversity of backgrounds. The general CNN-based object detectors primarily rely on downsampling and pooling operations, often struggling with small objects that have low resolution and failing to fully leverage contextual information that can differentiate objects from complex background. To address the problems, we propose a novel YOLO framework called SF-YOLO for small object detection. Firstly, we present a spatial information perception (SIP) module to extract contextual features for different objects through the integration of space to depth operation and large selective kernel module, which dynamically adjusts receptive field of the backbone and obtains the enhanced features for richer understanding of differentiation between objects and background. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-scale feature weighted fusion strategy, which performs weighted fusion on feature maps by combining fast normalized fusion method and CARAFE operation, accurately assessing the importance of each feature and enhancing the representation of small objects. The extensive experiments conducted on VisDrone2019, Tiny-Person and PESMOD datasets demonstrate that our proposed method enables comparable detection performance to state-of-the-art detectors.},

While recent STVSR works combine temporal interpolation and spatial super-resolution in a unified framework, they face challenges in computational complexity across both temporal and spatial dimensions, particularly in achieving accurate intermediate frame interpolation and efficient temporal information utilisation. To address these, we propose a deformable attention network for efficient STVSR. Specifically, we introduce a deformable interpolation block that employs hierarchical feature fusion to effectively handle complex inter-frame motions at multiple scales, enabling more accurate intermediate frame generation. To fully utilise temporal information, we design a temporal feature shuffle block (TFSB) to efficiently exchange complementary information across multiple frames. Additionally, we develop a motion feature enhancement block incorporating channel attention mechanism to selectively emphasise motion-related features, further boosting TFSB&#39;s effectiveness.

This paper proposes a robust text watermarking method based on the stroke components of Chinese characters. By designing an innovative approach, Chinese character strokes are divided into several distinct components, with only specific ones being selectively modified to generate new glyphs, thus forming a unique codebook. The watermark signals are embedded by substituting the carrier glyph with the newly generated one, and the signals are extracted using a template matching method. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional manually designed codebooks, the proposed method significantly reduces human labor and computational overhead while maintaining high visual quality.

  abstract     = {In coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) systems, deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have made significant strides in recovering 3D hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single 2D measurement. However, the inherent nonlinearity and ill-posed nature of HSI reconstruction continue to challenge existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight collaborative attention-enhanced accelerated unfolding network ( ), which integrates a DUN framework with a streamlined prior extractor. Our integrated approach introduces a generically accelerated half-quadratic splitting algorithm (A-HQS) for degradation estimation, overcoming the limitations of first-order optimization and enabling effective long-range dependency modeling. Within the prior extractor, we introduce cross-convergence attention, facilitating iterative information exchange between local and non-local Transformers to capture holistic features and enhance inductive capacity. Notably, the concept of collaborative cross-convergence is embedded throughout all submodules, ensuring effective information flow. The proposed not only accelerates the convergence of spectral reconstruction, but also fully exploits compressed spatial-spectral information. Numerical and visual comparisons on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this approach. Comparisons on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate the superiority of this approach. The source code is available at https://github.com/Mengjie-s/CA2UN .},

To mitigate the destructive impacts, such as loss of life and economic ramifications, automatic flood analysis and remote-sensing imagery segmentation offer valuable decision-making insights. However, the segmentation process for flood detection faces challenges due to the scarcity of labelled data and diverse resolutions, including medium resolution data. In response, the authors propose Flood-MATE, a novel semi-supervised learning approach based on the mean-teacher model.

Initially, a method to extend the maximum fitting FOV of the camera model to over 180 degrees is proposed. Subsequently, a calibration board detection approach is proposed using SE(3) image pre-correction. Specifically, image pre-correction is incorporated into the camera calibration process, utilizing SE(3) to define the pre-correction plane. Calibration boards are detected within the pre-corrected images, enhancing the reliability, accuracy and speed of board detection in distorted images, consequently increasing the control point&#39;s maximum FOV. Lastly, the improved camera model and SE(3) image pre-correction are integrated into a feedback-based camera calibration system for ultra-wide FOV fisheye cameras. Operating with real-time or offline video streams as input, this system autonomously selects calibration key frames, optimizes camera parameters and calibration board poses in real-time. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to a 62% increase in the achievable maximum FOV.},

Accurately positioning the centre of OVL targets is fundamental for effective metrology. However, the identification and localization of target centres become challenging due to complex shapes and unexpected features, such as rounded corners, that can arise during manufacturing. An algorithm is proposed to tackle this challenge by employing customizable shape fitting. This method begins with the extraction of sub-pixel edge points, followed by applying a Hough transform to group and smooth these points, thereby enhancing contour quality. By parameterizing the target shape based on specific points, the algorithm integrates sub-pixel traversal techniques with an optimization objective, achieving sub-pixel accuracy in centre positioning. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm can achieve a positioning accuracy of ±0.03 pixels and demonstrates robustness against noise and blur. Finally, the proposed algorithm was used to test the OVL target pair arrays fabricated by electron beam etching, confirming an accuracy of ±0.04 pixels (±6.9 nm). These results validate the algorithm&#39;s capability to meet high precision requirements for OVL target centre positioning in wafer applications.},

  abstract     = {In high-precision image segmentation tasks, even slight deviations in the segmentation results can bring about significant consequences, especially in certain application areas such as medical imaging and remote sensing image classification. The precision of segmentation has become the main factor limiting its development. Researchers typically refine image segmentation algorithms to enhance accuracy, but it is challenging for any improvement strategy to be effectively applied to images of different objects and scenes. To address this issue, we propose a two-step refinement method for image segmentation, comprising region expansion and minor contour adjustments. First, we design an adaptive gradient thresholding module to provide gradient-based constraints for the refinement process. Next, the region expansion module iteratively refines each segmented region based on colour differences and gradient thresholds. Finally, the minor contour adjustments module leverages local strong gradient features to refine the contour positions further. This method integrates region-level and pixel-level information to refine various image segmentation results. This method was applied to the BSDS500, Cells, and WHU Building datasets. The results demonstrate that the refined closed contours align more closely with the ground truth, with the most notable improvement observed at contour inflection points (corner points). Among the results, the Cells dataset showed the most significant improvement in segmentation accuracy, with the F-score increasing from 87.51% to 89.73% and IoU from 86.83% to 88.40%.},

However, the diagnosis of each modality is not entirely accurate. Compounding the challenge is the difficulty in acquiring multi-modal data, with existing datasets frequently lacking paired multi-modal data. To solve these problems, we propose multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm and cross-modal generation algorithm. The multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm first calculates the mean and variance separately for each modality, and then generates multi-modal diagnostic results in a distribution fusion manner. In order to generate the absent modality (mainly OCT data), three sub-networks are designed in the cross-modal generation algorithm: cross-modal alignment network, conditional deformable autoencoder and latent consistency diffusion model (LCDM). Finally, we propose multi-task collaboration strategy where diagnosis and generation tasks are mutually reinforcing to achieve optimal performance.

  abstract     = {Local binary patterns (LBP) play a vital role in image classification as a computationally efficient feature descriptor. A crucial reason for its limitation of discriminability is the lack of neighbourhood information description from a global perspective. Previous research has attempted to improve its performance by introducing global thresholds, but such threshold selection is not optimal. To address this issue, we propose a novel tomography-aided local binary patterns (TLBP), inspired by the tomographic process of sample separation. TLBP considers constructing visual feature representations under multi-level non-local information to compensate for the lack of LBP possessing only a single shallow feature. In addition to the basic LBP features from local visual context, TLBP captures refined neighbourhood greyscale information through multi-quantile thresholds from a global visual perspective, thereby greatly enhancing discriminability. Experimental results in texture classification, face recognition, and hyperspectral pixel-wise classification demonstrate that the proposed TLBP descriptor outperforms the competitors, achieving 94.39% (KTH-TIPS), 81.22% (KTH-TIPS-ROT), 93.81% (Indian Pines), 99.85% (Salinas), and 99.50% (ORL) accuracy.

  abstract     = {In order to address the challenge of small target recognition in traffic scenes, we propose a model based on you only look once version 8X (Yolov8X) network model, which has been combined with receptive fields block (RFB) and multidimensional collaborative attention (MCA). First, the model employs the RFB to extract reliable and distinctive features, thereby enhancing the precision of small target identification. Furthermore, the MCA structure is introduced to simulate multidimensional attention through three parallel branches, thereby enhancing the feature expression ability of the model. This fragment describes a compression transformation and an excitation transformation that captures the differentiated feature representation of the command. These transformations facilitate the network&#39;s ability to locate and predict the location of small objects more accurately. Utilizing these transformations enhances the expressiveness and diversity of features, thereby improving the detection performance of small objects. Furthermore, data augmentation and hyperparameter optimization techniques are employed to enhance the model&#39;s generalisability. The validation results on the Argoverse 1.1 autonomous driving dataset demonstrate that the enhanced network model outperforms the prevailing detectors, achieving an F1 score of 78.6, an average precision of 55.1, and an average recall of 72.4. The algorithm&#39;s excellent performance for small target detection was demonstrated through visual analysis, proving its high application value and potential for promotion in fields such as autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution images are crucial for many applications, but factors such as environmental conditions can reduce image quality. Super-resolution (SR) techniques address this by generating high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. While deep learning SR models have made significant progress, they can be computationally expensive and struggle with differentiating between various image scales. Lightweight SR methods, suitable for resource-constrained devices, often compromise image quality. This study introduces a multi-stage holistic attention-based network, using Gaussian Laplacian pyramids to decompose images and apply holistic attention modules at each level. This approach reduces parameters and computational costs while maintaining image quality, achieving a PSNR score of 28 and SSIM of 0.91 with only 29,000 parameters. The model demonstrates the potential for efficient and high-quality image reconstruction. Future work will focus on improving quality while minimizing costs and exploring other advanced techniques.

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image target detection provides an effective and accurate data analysis tool for many application areas. Due to complex backgrounds, large differences in target scales, and missed detection of small targets, remote sensing image target detection is challenging. In order to enhance the model&#39;s understanding of the global information of remote sensing images, this paper proposes the GFA module. This module can establish the global contextual connection of remote sensing images to provide rich context to help understand the complex scene and background in which the target is located, without being limited to local information. Additionally, it focuses on channel information for enhanced target feature extraction. For the purpose of alleviating the serious imbalance in foreground–background samples that is present in single-level target detection models. The loss function is reconstructed based on focal loss by redefining the balance factor α and focus factor γ , so that it can be dynamically adjusted during network training. Meanwhile, EIoU is used to further enhance the bounding box regression capability. Affine transformations were also used to augment the dataset in order to assist the model in adjusting to real-world situations. The proposed method is experimentally validated on the publicly available HRRSD dataset. In comparison with YOLO v5, the mAP of the detection results improved by 2.7%. Compared with YOLO v8 and YOLO v10, the mAP improved by 3.2% and 3.3%. The model achieves an FPS of 40.1, an optimal balance between speed and accuracy. Further, experiments are conducted using the NWPU VHR-10 dataset and the RSOD dataset, both of which demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms other target detection methods and improves remote sensing target detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Automatic liver segmentation is of great significance for computer-aided treatment and surgery of liver diseases. However, respiratory motion often affects the liver, leading to image artifacts in liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and increasing segmentation difficulty. To overcome this issue, we propose a global spatial structure-aware attention model (GSA-Net), a robust segmentation network developed to overcome the difficulties caused by respiratory motion. The GSA-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture, which extracts spatial structure information from images and identifies different objects using the minimum spanning tree algorithm. The network&#39;s encoder extracts multi-scale image features with the help of an effective and lightweight channel attention module. The decoder then transforms these features bottom-up using tree filter modules. Combined with the boundary detection module, the segmentation performance can be further improved. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two liver MRI benchmarks: one with respiratory artifacts and the other without. Numerical evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that GSA-Net consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of segmentation precision on our respiratory artifact dataset, and also achieves notable results on high-quality datasets.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely studied and applied in many fields. Although image super-resolution technology has been successfully applied to SAR imaging in recent years, there is less research on large-scale factor SAR image super-resolution methods. A more effective method is to obtain comprehensive information to guide the reconstruction of SAR images. In fact, the co-registered characteristics of high-resolution optical images have been successfully applied to improve the quality of SAR images. Inspired by this, an optical-guided multi-kernel attention based SAR image super-resolution reconstruction network (OMA-SSR) is proposed. The proposed multi-modal mutual attention (MMA) module in this network can effectively establish the dependency between SAR image features and optical image features. This network also designs a deep feature extraction module for SAR images, which includes a channel-splitted multi-kernel attention (CSMA) module and residual connections. CSMA module splits SAR image channels, extracts features in different ranges through multi-kernel convolution, and finally fuses the extracted features between different channels. Experimental results on the Sen1-2 and QXS datasets show that the proposed OMA-SSR performs well in evaluation indicators and visual effects of SAR image super-resolution reconstruction.},

However, in previous works, the negatives are sampled from the input image itself, which inspires us to design a data augmentation method to improve the quality of the selected negatives. Moreover, the previous methods only preserve the content consistency via patch-wise contrastive learning, which ignores the domain consistency between the generated images and the real images of the target domain. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised i2i translation framework based on multi-cropping contrastive learning and domain consistency, called MCDUT. Specifically, the multi-cropping views are obtained with the aim of further generating high-quality negative examples. To constrain the embeddings in the deep feature space, a new domain consistency loss is formulated, which encourages the generated images to be close to the real images. In many i2i translation tasks, this method achieves state-of-the-art results, and the advantages of this method have been proven through extensive comparison experiments and ablation research.

This module will make the network pay attention to the overall structure and local details of the image during network training, improving the network&#39;s recognition ability for steganography information. Finally, the extracted steganography features are classified through a classification module. This paper conducted a series of experiments on the BOSSBase 1.01 and BOWS2 datasets.

Most existing face frontalization methods rely on heavy architectures that struggle with small datasets and produce low-quality images. Additionally, although video frames provide richer information, these methods typically use single images due to the lack of suitable multi-image datasets. To address these issues, a parameter-efficient framework for high-quality face frontalization in both single and multi-frame scenarios is proposed. First, a high-quality, diverse dataset is created for single and multi-image face frontalization tasks. Second, a novel single-image face frontalization method is introduced by combining GAN inversion with transfer learning. This approach reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 91% compared to existing GAN inversion methods while achieving far more photorealistic results than GAN-based methods. Finally, this method is extended to sequences of images, using attention mechanisms to merge information from multiple frames. This multi-frame approach reduces artefacts like eye blinks and improves reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that this single-image method outperforms pSp, a state-of-the-art GAN inversion method, with a 0.15 LPIPS improvement and a 0.10 increase in ID similarity. This multi-frame approach further improves identity preservation to 0.87, showcasing its effectiveness for high-quality frontal-view reconstructions.},

  abstract     = {Hard of hearing (HoH) people commonly use sign languages (SLs) to communicate. They face major impediments in communicating with hearing individuals, mostly because hearing people are unaware of SLs. Therefore, it is important to promote tools that enable communication between users of sign language and users of spoken languages. The study of sign language recognition and translation (SLRT) is a step forward in this direction, as it tries to create a spoken-language translation of a sign-language video or vice versa. This study aims to survey the Indian sign language (ISL) interpretation literature and gives pertinent information about ISL recognition and translation (ISLRT). It provides an overview of recent advances in ISLRT, including the use of machine learning based, deep learning based, and gesture-based techniques. This work also summarizes the development of ISL datasets and dictionaries. It highlights the gaps in the literature and provides recommendations for future research opportunities for ISLRT development.},

  abstract     = {This study investigated the possibility of using a laser methane detector (LMD) and optical gas imaging (OGI) to detect and quantify enteric methane ( CH 4 ${\rm CH}_4$ ) produced by ruminants in vitro. Four single-flow continuous fermenters were used for rumen culture incubation with four different treatment diets: Control (50:50 forage to concentrate [F:C] ratio), Control + Bromoform (CBR), Low Forage (LF; 20:80), and High Forage (HF; 80:20). After 10 days of incubation, all fermenter contents were transferred and used in a 24 h ANKOM batch culture to measure gas production with LMD and OGI. The authors introduce the Controlled Diet (CD) dataset, a large-scale collection of 4,885 plume images captured using an FLIR GF77 OGI camera under varying dietary conditions. The performance of six semantic segmentation models (FCN, U-Net, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, DeepLabv3+, and Gasformer) on the CD dataset is compared. Results showed that LMD data for followed a similar pattern to the gas chromatography (GC) instrument results. The in vitro results showed that different diets and F:C ratios had an impact on gas production and rumen fermentation characteristics. Adding bromoform to the control diet fully inhibited emission. The HF diet produced more compared to all treatments ( ) when measured with GC and LMD. CBR produced the lowest values when measured with GC and LMD. The Gasformer architecture achieved the highest performance with mean IoU of 85.1% and mean F-score of 91.72%. These findings demonstrate that OGI technology combined with advanced semantic segmentation models offers a promising solution for predicting and quantifying emissions in the livestock sector, potentially aiding in the development of mitigation strategies to combat climate change.},

To address the issue of dominant features being suppressed during feature fusion in FER, this study proposes a self-learning weight network based on label distribution training (SLW-LDT). First, based on the ShuffleNet-V2 backbone model, SLW-LDT introduced a local feature extraction branch that highlights specific expression-related features by cropping the facial image into four local regions. Subsequently, the SLW algorithm is devised to allocate learnable weights to global and local features from different branches before their fusion. Moreover, considering the challenge associated with accessing emotional distribution in facial images directly, a label distribution training module (LDT) is introduced during the training phase to generate label distributions for effective training purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracies of 89.77% and 64.21% on two in-the-wild datasets (RAF-DB and AffectNet-7), and 98.90% on the lab-controlled CK+ dataset. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods reveals slight improvements in recognition accuracy along with robust performance exhibited by the model.},

Firstly, OLODN employs FasterNet blocks and reparameterised generalised-FPN to reduce computational complexity and preserve feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Secondly, a reinforced coordination attention mechanism is designed to strengthen the network&#39;s ability to capture occlusion boundary information. Additionally, a spatial pyramid pooling feature concatenation module is introduced to integrate multi-scale features and enhance the algorithm&#39;s robustness to occlusions.

Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. On the WiderPerson dataset, OLODN achieved a recall rate of 68.0%, which is 2.8% higher than YOLOv11&#39;s 65.2%, while running at 35.3 frames per second (f/s) on CPU and 76.6 f/s on GPU, faster than YOLOv11&#39;s 34.1 f/s and 74.5 f/s by 1.2 f/s and 2.1 f/s, respectively.},

Despite extensive research on morphing detection, limited attention has been given to restoring accomplice face images, which is critical for forensic applications. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel face de-morphing (FD) method based on identity feature transfer for restoring accomplice face images. The method encodes facial attribute and identity features separately and employs cross-attention mechanisms to extract identity features from morphed faces relative to reference images. This process isolates and enhances the accomplice&#39;s identity features. Additionally, inverse linear interpolation is applied to transfer identity features to attribute features, further refining the restoration process. The enhanced identity features are then integrated with the StyleGAN generator to reconstruct high-quality accomplice facial images. Experimental evaluations on two morphed face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, improving the average restoration accuracy by at least 5% compared with other methods. These findings highlight the potential of this approach for advancing forensic and security applications.},

Recently, due to the rise and widespread use of spike cameras, learning optical flow from spiking cameras has become a hot topic in the field of two-dimensional motion estimation. Although existing methods have been designed to learn optical flow by designing feature processing methods for spike streams, there is still insufficient consideration for flow field post-processing, resulting in limited accuracy of optical flow estimation. To address this problem, an optical flow estimation method based on directional disassembly is proposed. Specifically, the estimated flow fields along the horizontal and vertical directions are disassembled and the motion vectors along the two directions are denoised separately to reduce the burden of post-processing for complex two-dimensional motion information. In addition, contextual information is introduced in the post-processing so that the scene information can effectively contribute to the results of the flow post-processing.

First of all, the pictures of illegal manned vehicles obtained by relevant departments are expanded and labeled, and the dataset of illegal manned vehicles is created. Building upon the foundational YOLOv7 model, this study replaces the traditional convolution module with the FasterNet convolution module and SCConv module, and introduces the Wise-IoU (WIoU) loss function algorithm and Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism. The results show that the mAP value of the YOLOv7-SFWC model is improved by 4.15% and FPS by 7.6 compared with the original YOLOv7 model, and the computational complexity is reduced to adapt to the deployment. Moreover, the model&#39;s effectiveness is validated through extensive comparison experiments. Finally, the visual results show the accurate performance of the model and verify the progress of YOLOv7-SFWC.

Finally, for targets of varying sizes, a lightweight Transformer feature extraction module is proposed to improve the detection accuracy of small targets from a drone&#39;s perspective. Test results on the drone-vehicle dataset show that this method achieved an average detection accuracy of 67.92%, while the detection accuracy on the self-constructed UAV-data dataset reached 96.4%.

  abstract     = {As one of the world&#39;s most popular beverages, tea plays a significant role in improving tea production efficiency and quality through the identification of tea shoots during the tea manufacturing process. However, due to the complex morphology, small size, and susceptibility to factors like lighting and obstruction, traditional identification methods suffer from low accuracy and efficiency. In this study, image enhancement techniques such as HSV transformation, horizontal flipping, and vertical flipping were applied to the training dataset to improve model robustness and enhance generalization across varying lighting and angles. To address these challenges in the context of tea buds detection, deep-learning-based object detection methods have emerged as promising solutions. Nevertheless, current object detection technologies still face limitations when detecting tea buds under these conditions. To enhance identification performance, this article proposed an improved YOLOv5s (You Only Look Once version 5 small model) algorithm. In the improved YOLOv5s algorithm, CBAM, SE, and CA attention mechanisms were incorporated into the backbone network to augment feature extraction, and a weighted Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is employed in the neck network to boost performance, resulting in the YOLOv5s_teabuds model. Experimental results indicated that the improved model significantly outperformed the original in terms of precision, recall, mAP and F1-score, with the CA attention mechanism providing the most notable improvement—enhancing precision, recall, mAP and F1-score by 18.119%, 9.633%, 16.496% and 13.524%, respectively. After integrating BiFPN, the YOLOv5s_teabuds model further strengthened performance and robustness, with precision, recall, mAP and F1-score increased by 19.346%, 11.388%, 18.620%, and 15.059%, respectively.

Image inpainting techniques restore such images, but different types—Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), RGB, and infrared—require varying field-of-view sizes. SAR and infrared images, with less information, need a larger field of view, leading to uncorrelated interference in distant areas. RGB images, richer in information, are constrained by a limited local field of view, hindering access to full semantic details. To address these challenges, an aggregated convolution progressive network is proposed. This model employs a coarse-grained inpainting module for initial restoration, enhanced by an aggregated convolution module to capture contextual information. Local and global details are then used to refine the output, improving restoration quality. Additionally, existing datasets predominantly focus on RGB images, lacking diversity. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive dataset covering SAR, RGB, and infrared images under cloud, overlap, and corruption conditions is constructed. This method achieves superior performance, with MAE of 0.05, SSIM of 0.95, and PSNR of 36.68 within a 20–30% mask size range, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across diverse image types and size ranges.

  abstract     = {Automatic segmentation of muscle and adipose tissue in chest CT scans is essential for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of various diseases. However, this task is hindered by the limited availability of annotated data. This study proposes a novel semi-supervised learning framework, co-teacher-guided pseudo-label supervision (CTGP), to address this challenge. CTGP combines co-training and the Mean-Teacher strategy, where predictions generated by teacher models are filtered and utilized as high-quality pseudo-labels to train the other student models, thus facilitating co-training. Additionally, a medical image-specific augmentation method, MIAugment, is introduced to better adapt to the unique characteristics of medical data. Experiments on a real-life clinical dataset demonstrate that CTGP achieves high segmentation accuracy with minimal labelled data. Using only 10% of labelled data, the framework achieves a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.03% for four tissue types, a decrease of just 2.85% compared to fully supervised learning. This approach provides a promising solution for automated muscle and adipose tissue segmentation with limited annotations.},

Traditional text-guided attention-based methods have achieved better results than baselines, but it is argued that there is still potential for improvement in the area of multi-modal fusion. Thus, Mono3DVG-TRv2, an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that employs a visual-text multi-modal encoder for the alignment and fusion of multi-modal features, incorporating an enhanced transformer module proven in 2D detection, is introduced. The depth features predicted by the multi-modal features and the visual-text features are associated with the learnable queries in the decoder, facilitating more efficient and effective acquisition of geometric information in intricate scenes.

  abstract     = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial target detection tasks, two main challenges exist: the limited computational resources of UAV terminals, which are not conducive to running complex models, and the prevalence of small targets, which can easily lead to missed detections and false positives. To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight and high-accuracy small-object detection algorithm for UAV aerial imagery that is based on YOLOv5s. First, the network structure is optimized by removing the layers in YOLOv5s primarily used for detecting large targets (P4 and P5) and adding layers primarily used for detecting small targets (P2 and P3). This enables the model to focus more on extracting small-object features. A lightweight dynamic convolution is subsequently introduced in the C3 module, and the lightweight LW_C3 and LW_downsampling modules are designed for feature extraction and downsampling operations. This enhances the model&#39;s feature extraction capability while achieving a lightweight design. Finally, the adaptive multi-scale spatial feature fusion (AMSFF) module is designed to adaptively learn the spatial weights of the feature maps at different levels, thereby further strengthening the effective fusion of multi-scale features. Experimental results show that the improved YOLO-Tiny model has higher accuracy and lower complexity, hence validating its excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image super-resolution by addressing issues such as transition smoothing, insufficient high-frequency information, and training instability encountered in regression-based and GAN-based models. However, challenges persist when applying diffusion models to image super-resolution, including randomness, inadequate conditional information, high computational costs, and network architecture complexities. In this article, the authors introduce a diffusion model based on Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE), and propose the use of ENAFBlocks instead of traditional ResBlocks to enhance model performance in noise prediction. The Mean-Reverting SDE effectively mitigates the randomness of the diffusion model by leveraging low-resolution images as means. Additionally, an LR Encoder is introduced to capture hidden information from LR images, providing a more robust condition for stable result generation by the noise predictor. To efficiently handle high-resolution images within limited GPU memory, the method employs adaptive aggregate sampling, which merges overlapping regions smoothly using weighted averaging. Furthermore, color variations are addressed during diffusion model sampling through color correction. Extensive experiments on CelebA, DIV2K, and Urban100 demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models like IDM, with a PSNR improvement of 0.22 dB, FID reduction of 2.35, and LPIPS reduction of 0.05 on the DIV2K dataset, along with a reduced parameter count and faster inference time.},

Most of the previous research on multimodal fusion is single-stage fusion, disregarding how various modality subsets interact, as well as rarely considering relative position relationship of modality sequences, causing the fragmentation of context info. Considering the aforementioned issues, this study introduces an MSA method based on the multi-stage graph fusion network (MSGFN) under random missing modality conditions to improve the robustness of the model to MSA under the random missing modality conditions. Firstly, for each modality, its inter-modal and intra-modal multi-head attention are used to learn robust representation of the modality sequence. Meanwhile, the relative position encoding (RPE) is introduced into mechanism of attention that enables model to perceive and learn the relative position before and after the modality sequence when calculating attention, thereby better understanding the contextual info of the sequence. After that, the transformer encoder receives the learned modality features and uses the pre-trained model to supervise the reconstruction of the missing modality information. Finally, the feature representations of different modalities have effectively fused using multi-stage graph fusion network, and the output is used for the ultimate sentiment classification. Wide experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets, CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP, and the findings indicate that the proposed method can better handle the challenges caused by modality fusion and modality missing compared with several baseline methods.},

However, the current popular methods are susceptible to the ‘copying shortcut’ phenomenon, which constrains their performance on benchmark datasets. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a multi-class anomaly detection model: UniRD, based on the reverse distillation method. This model creates an image corruptor that expands the dataset and generates ‘normal-corrupt’ image pairs. During the training process, their correspondence is used to optimize the reverse distillation. This process greatly exploits and releases the potential of the student decoder. Furthermore, a teacher feature adaptation module is devised to enhance the compatibility between the pre-trained model and the anomaly detection task. This has the effect of reducing the discrepancy between teacher and student features while ensuring the consistency of normal sample features. The comprehensive evaluation results in two mainstream datasets, MVTec and VisA, and demonstrates that the proposed method exhibits improvement in all indicators compared to benchmark methods. The proposed method attains the state-of-the-art, substantiating its effectiveness and advancement.},

The presence of occlusion in a scene is primarily attributed to variations in viewpoint and access time, thereby posing a significant challenge in accurately predicting scene flow. In the endeavour to mitigate this issue, the focus is on the propagation of scene flow originating from non-occluded points towards occlusion points while concurrently estimating the occlusion map.

Image classified as normal by CNN-J is not processed, while the classified noisy image is denoised. In the denoising process, a marking image and a rough denoised image are generated by CNN for noise mask (CNN-M) and CNN for denoising (CNN-D), respectively. Subsequently, the refined denoised image is output using the proposed refining mechanism. The middle layers of CNN-M and CNN-D are constructed by depth-separable CNN to reduce the network complexity. Experimental results show that the misjudging rate of CNN-M marking is reduced by 19.94% compared with the best existing marking method. Compared with the traditional methods, the peak signal to noise ratio of the proposed method is increased by 2.95% and the information loss is reduced by 21.46%.

For these reasons, Remote-Sensing Single-Image Super-Resolution (RS-SISR) techniques have gained significant interest. In this paper, Swin2-MoSE model is proposed, an enhanced version of Swin2SR. The model introduces MoE-SM, an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to replace the Feed-Forward inside all Transformer block. MoE-SM is designed with Smart-Merger, and new layer for merging the output of individual experts, and with a new way to split the work between experts, defining a new per-example strategy instead of the commonly used per-token one. Furthermore, it is analyzed how positional encodings interact with each other, demonstrating that per-channel bias and per-head bias can positively cooperate. Finally, the authors propose to use a combination of Normalized-Cross-Correlation (NCC) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) losses, to avoid typical MSE loss limitations.

  abstract     = {It is well known that image quality needs to be measured with human perception in many computer vision applications. However, these approaches are expensive and require more time for image quality analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and computationally efficient objective-mathematical model based on statistical perceptual features. The structural and textural features are computed using the modified regularized heaviside local binary pattern (RH-LBP) approach and the concept of entropy. The higher-order probability coefficients of images are considered to extract features that are highly correlated to the human visual system features. Further, the additivity property of Renyi entropy is used to show the randomness of the information combining two terms: One extracts the images spatial intensity changes, and therefore their texture qualities, and the other attain structural details. The features in the proposed approach are jointly optimized to achieve better robustness, monotonicity and match human assessments on image quality, while minimizing the computational complexity and run time. Experiments are conducted with three synthetically distorted datasets, KonIQ-10K, BIQ2021, and LIVE (wild), and two intentionally distorted datasets, TID2013 and CSIQ and are used to evaluate performance index. The proposed method offers competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

This study addresses challenges in rice field images, such as environmental variability and differences in rice leaf sizes. The proposed technique combines convolutional neural network object detection with image tiling, using estimated rice leaf width as a reference for image division. An 18-layer ResNet model was trained using ground truth leaf width values for regression in leaf width estimation. Experiments used a dataset of 4960 images representing 8 rice diseases. The leaf width prediction model achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 11.18% and was used to generate a tiled dataset for training advanced rice disease detection models. The tiling technique was evaluated using YOLOv4, YOLOv8n, YOLOv8l, DINO-5scale Swin-L, and Co-DINO-5scale Swin-L models by comparing detection performance on original and tiled datasets. Mean average precision improved significantly: YOLOv4 increased from 87.56% to91.14%, YOLOv8n from 89.80% to 91.70%, and YOLOv8l from 89.80% to 93.20%. More advanced models, such as DINO5scale Swin-L and Co-DINO-5scale Swin-L, achieved even higher precision, at 93.40% and 94.20%, respectively.

  abstract     = {The detection of road potholes plays a crucial role in ensuring passenger comfort and the structural safety of vehicles. To address the challenges of pothole detection in complex road environments, this paper proposes a model focusing on shape features (pothole detection you only look once, PD-YOLO). The model aims to overcome the limitations of multi-scale feature learning caused by the use of fixed convolutional kernels in the baseline model, by constructing a feature extraction module that better adapts to variations in the shape of potholes. Subsequently, a cross-stage partial network was designed using a one-time aggregation method, simplifying the model while enabling the network to fuse information between feature maps at different stages. Additionally, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism is introduced to select relevant features, reducing redundancy and suppressing background noise. Experiments conducted on the VOC2007 and GRDDC2020_Pothole datasets reveal that compared to the baseline model YOLOv8, PD-YOLO achieves improvements of 3.9% and 2.8% in mean average precision, with a frame rate of approximately 290 frames per second, effectively meeting the accuracy and real-time requirements for pothole detection.

First, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) with geometric transformations is designed, which uses rotated labels as supervision to obtain lower-level characteristics that more accurately capture various orientations and then makes use of a spectral-spatial characteristic extraction network to maximize the utilization of HSI&#39;s spectrum and spatial information. Next, a class anchor open-set classification module based on a twin clustering network is designed, which uses SCL and FSL to extract more specific personal information by mining the category-invariant characteristics present in the known versus unknown class data. Finally, multiple convolution and open-set recognition (OSC) is performed on the feature blocks. Experimental results on three classical HSI datasets show that FSSCL-OSC provides a significant improvement over existing methods, under a sample size of only 10%, the overall accuracy reached 82.38%, 90.76% and 84.70%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Compared with common urban landscape semantic segmentation, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image semantic segmentation is more challenging because small targets have very low pixel percentages and multi-scale features due to the influence of flight altitude. Yet, the commonly used successive grid downsampling strategy in the current transformer-based methods omits some important features of small targets. Furthermore, due to the complex background interference, it can lead to even worse results. In reaction to this, existing strategies aim to maintain superior resolution. Nevertheless, the application of this method incurs considerable computational costs, which brings challenges for the practical applications of UAVs. So it is significant to design a novel framework to balance retaining more pixels representing small objects during downsampling and reducing computational costs. For this, the Channel Selection and the Local Attention Transformer Model (CSLFormer) are proposed. During the overlap patch embedding process of feature maps, the model allocates half of the important channels to global attention and local attention. These two types of attention focus on different aspects: one learns the relationships and importance among various patches, while the other emphasizes the features of individual patches. The method shows superior performance on two public datasets: AeroScapes and Vaihingen, achieving mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 75.57% and 78.93%, respectively.

However, images captured by fisheye cameras suffer from significant geometric distortions, affecting image analysis and understanding. This distortion bends straight lines into curves, resulting in a barrel-shaped appearance of the image. To mitigate these effects and transform fisheye images into a regular perspective, fisheye image correction is necessary, enabling more accurate and reliable performance in applications like object recognition, 3D reconstruction, and visual navigation. While convolutional neural networks based fisheye image correction has progressed, it has not fully utilized the global distribution and local symmetry of distortions due to the limitations of fixed receptive fields. This paper introduces a new model based on the Swin Transformer that effectively utilizes both global and local distortion features to adapt automatically to fisheye lens distortions.

Furthermore, the multi-scale cross-fusion module cross-fuses the different scale features and then goes through the multi-scale convolutional parallel feedforward transformer module for modelling the global and local information. Finally, progressive attentional up-sampling module acts as a decoder for up-sampling with progressive attention to get the final polyp segmentation result.

Ultrasound imaging is often the initial diagnostic test for gallbladder cancer, making the enhancement of cancer detection accuracy from these images crucial. Despite the promising results of artificial intelligence techniques in disease diagnosis, their black-box nature hinders the reliability of their results and their practical application. Therefore, it is essential not to rely solely on a single model&#39;s output and to further investigate for more reliable outcomes. This study presents a step-by-step structural investigation of forming an end-to-end model, a conjunction of two convolutional neural network based methods, for detecting gallbladder conditions. The final model, leveraging feature fusions and hierarchical classification, achieved a high accuracy of 92.62% for detecting normal, benign, and malignant gallbladders. It also achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.36% for classifying normal and non-normal instances and 92.22% for classifying benign and malignant cases. Finally, comprehensive post-processing investigations, including cross-validation, temperature scaling, and uncertainty estimation, along with error analysis, are conducted to gain more insights into the model&#39;s output. Among these insights, the model demonstrated resilience of its results to active dropout and augmentation at the inference phase. Furthermore, when applied with test-time data augmentation, uncertainty estimation methods have better distinguishability between the uncertainties of correctly and incorrectly classified instances, which provides additional information about the model&#39;s output.

The authors aim to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to learn mitochondrial morphological features. The approach begins with self-supervised learning from a vast set of unlabeled images through masked image modeling. This technique involves presenting images with randomly masked patches, prompting the model to predict the content of these masked areas. By doing so, the model learns the distinctive features of mitochondria. In the subsequent phase, the trained encoder is transferred to the segmentation task, replacing the original reconstruction decoder with the Segformer segmentation decoder. The model is then fine-tuned using a small labeled dataset. By reconstructing mitochondria in the masked regions, the model learns features more effectively on unlabeled samples, and improves segmentation performance even with limited labeled data. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing an 11.8% improvement in Intersection over Union metrics compared to existing fluorescence mitochondrial segmentation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Early diagnosis of brain tumors significantly enhances treatment success. However, accurate detection and segmentation of tumors, essential for diagnosis, rely heavily on costly manual annotation by experts. To mitigate these costs, weakly supervised methods have gained traction. This paper introduces a novel weakly supervised brain tumor segmentation approach utilizing point and scribble supervision. Experts annotate only the slice with the largest tumor area by marking a single point near the tumor center or drawing a scribble within the tumor region. The method operates in two phases. First, labels are propagated to unlabelled pixels, generating a pseudo-ground-truth with three labels: tumor, non-tumor, and marginal pixels (unlabelled pixels surrounding the initial segmentation). Second, a segmentation model is trained using the pseudo-ground-truth and a loss function combining level-set and binary cross-entropy losses. Marginal pixels contribute to level-set loss computation, refining the segmentation process. The approach is validated on 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes from BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show Dice scores comparable to fully supervised methods for whole tumor segmentation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed weakly supervised strategy. This method reduces annotation effort while maintaining competitive segmentation performance, making it valuable for clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Maize leaf disease seriously affects maize yield, a maize leaf disease identification model with an improved lightweight network EfficientNet was proposed in this study. First, the model replaces the SENet module in the MBConv module with the CBAM module, so that the model not only focuses on the correlation between the channels but also adaptively learns the attentional weight of each spatial location. Furthermore, a multi-scale feature fusion layer based on residual connection is introduced to extract more comprehensive and richer disease features at different scales. Finally, by introducing the double pooling method, the overall feature distribution is smoothed while highlighting the important disease features. After the three improvements, the model&#39;s recognition accuracy on the test set increased by 2.34%, 2.16%, and 0.97%, respectively, and the improved model achieved an average recognition accuracy of 98.32%, an average precision of 98.29%, and an average recall of 98.25%. The experimental results compared with other models show that the average recognition accuracy of the proposed model is 5.23%, 3.68%, 1.99%, 1.79%, and 3.2% higher than ResNet34, DenseNet121, MobileNet V2, SqueezeNet, and EfficientNet B0, respectively. Activation heat maps show that the improved model can effectively suppress background interference.},

  abstract     = {In deep neural networks, performance can degrade when test data distributions differ from training data. Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) aims to improve generalization across unseen domains by leveraging multiple source domains without supervision. Traditional methods focus on extracting domain-invariant features, potentially at the expense of feature space integrity and generalization potential. We presents a Multi-Domain Representation Network (MDRN) for unsupervised multi-domain learning. MDRN innovates by disentangling and preserving both domain-invariant and domain-specific features through an unsupervised cross-domain reconstruction task. It employs content encoders for domain-invariant features and multi-domain style encoders for domain-specific characteristics. By merging these features based on domain similarity, MDRN constructs a comprehensive feature space that enhances image reconstruction across domains. Additionally, MDRN integrates domain-specific classifiers, which learn domain classification and provide weighted fusion of domain-specific features. This design facilitates effective inter-domain distance measurement and feature integration. Experiments on PACS and DomainNet show MDRN&#39;s superior performance over existing state-of-the-art UDG approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in handling distribution shifts between source and target domains.},

In this work, an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model with customized bottleneck residual module (Attn-CNN) is proposed for classifying CT images into three classes: COVID-19, normal, and other pneumonia.

In view of the low accuracy and poor real-time performance of multi-scale crowd detection, we design a crowd counting model based on YOLO v5, and apply it to the IoT environment. It is proposed to insert the transformer into the YOLO v5 backbone network. Based on the multi-head attention mechanism in the transformer encoder, the global dependency is modelled to make full use of the context information. The CNN is used to realize the fusion of multi-scale feature maps, and the feature enhancement modules concerned by the attention network are further counted.

There are a large number of face recognition and face attribute recognition scenarios in reality, and the industry commonly decomposes these tasks, with three models responsible for handling face detection, face recognition, and face attribute recognition. The multi-model approach requires a lot of computational resources for context switching, while training one model with one dataset is not only complex, but also leads to overfitting of the multi-model approach. The authors propose a single-model multi-task approach, which can complete all tasks using only one model, and thus obtains a great improvement in inference speed, especially in scenes with high face density. After an experimental comparison, our approach saves a maximum of 96% of inference time, 49.5% of memory usage, and 59.7% of CPU time, avoids frequent context switching, and simplifies the training steps while improving the generalization performance of the model.},

  abstract     = {Slender structures, such as rods, often exhibit large deformations even under moderate external forces (e.g., gravity). This characteristic results in a rich variety of morphological changes, making them appealing for engineering design and applications, such as soft robots, submarine cables, decorative knots, and more. Prior studies have demonstrated that the natural shape of a rod significantly influences its deformed geometry. Consequently, the natural shape of the rod should be considered when manufacturing and designing rod-like structures. Here, we focus on an inverse problem: Can we determine the natural shape of a suspended 2D planar rod so that it deforms into a desired target shape under the specified loading? We begin by formulating a theoretical framework based on the statics of planar rod equilibrium that can compute the natural shape of a planar rod given its target shape. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of uncertainties (e.g., noise in the data) on the accuracy of the theoretical framework. The results reveal the shortcomings of the theoretical framework in handling uncertainties in the inverse problem, a fact often overlooked in previous works. To mitigate the influence of the uncertainties, we combine the statics of the planar rod with the adjoint method for parameter sensitivity analysis, constructing a learning framework that can efficiently explore the natural shape of the designed rod with enhanced robustness. This framework is validated numerically for its accuracy and robustness, offering valuable insights into the inverse design of soft structures for various applications, including soft robotics and animation of morphing structures.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel framework for solving large-scale unsteady flow topology optimization problems. While most previous studies on fluid topology optimization assume steady-state flows, an increasing number of recent studies deal with unsteady flows, which are more general in engineering. However, unsteady flow topology optimization involves solving the governing and adjoint equations of a time-evolving system, which requires a significant computational cost for topology optimization with a fine mesh. Therefore, we propose a large-scale unsteady flow topology optimization based on the building-cube method (BCM), which is one of the hierarchical Cartesian mesh methods. Although the BCM has been confirmed to have excellent scalability and is suitable for massively parallel computing, there are no studies that have applied it to unsteady flow topology optimization. In the proposed method, the governing and adjoint equations are discretized by a cell-centered finite volume method based on the BCM, which can achieve high parallel efficiency even with a fine mesh. The effectiveness of the proposed method for large-scale computing is discussed through several examples of optimization and verification of computational efficiency by weak scaling.},

  abstract     = {The Material Point Method (MPM) is widely used to analyse coupled (solid-water) problems under large deformations/displacements. However, if not addressed carefully, MPM u-p formulations for poromechanics can be affected by two major sources of instability. Firstly, inf-sup condition violation can arise when the spaces for the displacement and pressure fields are not chosen correctly, resulting in an unstable pressure field when the equations are monolithically solved. Secondly, the intrinsic nature of particle-based discretisation makes the MPM an unfitted mesh-based method, which can affect the system&#39;s condition number and solvability, particularly when background mesh elements are poorly populated. This work proposes a solution to both problems. The inf-sup condition is avoided using two overlapping meshes, a coarser one for the pressure and a finer one for the displacement. This approach does not require stabilisation of the primary equations since it is stable by design and is particularly valuable for low-order shape functions. As for the system&#39;s poor condition number, a face ghost penalisation method is added to both the primary equations, which constitutes a novelty in the context of MPM mixed formulations. This study frequently makes use of the theories of functional analysis or the unfitted Finite Element Method (FEM). Although these theories may not directly apply to the MPM, they provide a robust and logical basis for the research. These rationales are further supported by four numerical examples, which encompass both elastic and elasto-plastic cases and drained and undrained conditions.},

This density functional theory (DFT) study investigates the formation of ladderenes via gold(I)-catalyzed alkyne-alkene coupling reactions. Our calculations reveal a step-wise chain propagation mechanism where the alkene product of each step reacts with a ligand-gold-alkyne complex, leading to the sequential addition of cyclobutene units. We demonstrate that electron-withdrawing substituents on the alkynes, such as chlorine, facilitate the dissociation of the gold catalyst (PMe 3 Au + ) from the cyclobutene adduct, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Solvent effects are also shown to significantly influence the reaction energetics. This finding highlights the significant impact of alkyne substitution on the catalytic cycle. The inherent exothermicity of ladderene formation, coupled with their unique structural features, suggests their potential for storing energy in the form of “covalently condensed acetylene”.},

However, the influence of substituents and molecular environments on their photochemistry remains unclear. In this work, the cis -to- trans photodynamics of five PSTs (PST1 to PST5) in the vacuum and aqueous solution were simulated using the ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) coupled with correlated multireference electronic structure calculations. Four distinct minima in the same conical intersection seam were discovered, serving as nonradiative decay channels. The aqueous environment slows photoisomerization and lowers its quantum yields and changes the structures near the conical intersection seam. Substituent position and electronegativity significantly impact the isomerization kinetics by altering energy gaps between MECIs and the S 1 state at the Franck-Condon region.

Throughout, we emphasize the maintenance/creation of 3D coordinates and better interoperability. The latter is achieved by stable embedding of meta-information into output files and by improving the mutual compatibility of molecular representations (e.g., aromaticity perception). ParaLig wraps around core functionalities provided by a variety of existing software: the two popular cheminformatics packages OpenBabel and RDKit, and the general force field providers CGenFF and AmberTools. Our workflows emphasize scalable bulk processing of large libraries of molecules, and we provide an MPI-based wrapper to simplify deployment to high-performance computing resources. Along with salient descriptions of the methods, we benchmark performance both in terms of throughput and in terms of the quality of some of the results.},

  abstract     = {Protein structural fluctuations, measured by Debye-Waller factors or B-factors, are known to be closely associated with protein flexibility and function. Theoretical approaches have also been developed to predict B-factor values, which reflect protein flexibility. Previous models have made significant strides in analyzing B-factors by fitting experimental data. In this study, we propose a novel approach for B-factor prediction using differential geometry theory, based on the assumption that the intrinsic properties of proteins reside on a family of low-dimensional manifolds embedded within the high-dimensional space of protein structures. By analyzing the mean and Gaussian curvatures of a set of low-dimensional manifolds defined by kernel functions, we develop effective and robust multiscale differential geometry (mDG) models. Our mDG model demonstrates a 27% increase in accuracy compared to the classical Gaussian network model (GNM) in predicting B-factors for a dataset of 364 proteins. Additionally, by incorporating both global and local protein features, we construct a highly effective machine-learning model for the blind prediction of B-factors. Extensive least-squares approximations and machine learning-based blind predictions validate the effectiveness of the mDG modeling approach for B-factor predictions.},

We have first deduced the missing interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system within the SPICA/SDK CG force-field (CG-FF). By monitoring the electron density profiles, the orientational order parameter, and reproducing the all-atom MD-derived free energy for the insertion of ethanol from the bulk aqueous phase to the hydrophobic core of the POPC-CHOL lipid bilayer, we successfully determined all the missing non-bonding interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system. The proposed force field was applied to investigate the effect of ethanol at various concentrations on unilamellar vesicles composed of POPC and cholesterol. It was found that 40 mol% or more concentration of ethanol is required to disintegrate or rupture the POPC-CHOL vesicle membranes. While cholesterol offers some resilience against the detrimental effects of ethanol, we still observe an increase in vesicle size (swelling) and a contraction in the bilayer thickness (thinning) as ethanol concentration rises from 0 to 30 mol%. At ethanol concentrations exceeding 30 mol%, the vesicles become increasingly susceptible to disintegration due to enhanced penetration of ethanol and water molecules into the hydrophobic core of the membranes.},

  abstract     = {A computational study of I-BODIPY (2-ethyl-4,4-difluoro-6,7-diiodo-1,3-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) has been carried out to investigate its key photophysical properties as a potential triplet photosensitizer capable of generating singlet oxygen. Multireference CASPT2 and CASSCF methods have been used to calculate vertical excitation energies and spin–orbit couplings (SOCs), respectively, in a model (mono-iodinated BODIPY) molecule to assess the applicability of the single-reference second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction, ADC(2), method to this and similar molecules. Subsequently, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), possibly within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA), using several exchange-correlation functionals has been tested on I-BODIPY against ADC(2), both employing a basis set with a two-component pseudopotential on the iodine atoms. Finally, the magnitudes of SOC between excited electronic states of all types found have thoroughly been discussed using the Slater–Condon rules applied to an arbitrary one-electron one-center effective spin–orbit Hamiltonian. The geometry dependence of SOCs between the lowest-lying states has also been addressed. Based on these investigations, the TD-DFT/B3LYP and TD-DFT(TDA)/BHLYP approaches have been selected as the methods of choice for the subsequent nuclear ensemble approach absorption spectra simulations and mixed quantum-classical trajectory surface hopping (TSH) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, respectively. Two bright states in the visible spectrum of I-BODIPY have been found, exhibiting a redshift of the main peak with respect to unsubstituted BODIPY caused by the iodine substituents. Excited-state MD simulations including both non-adiabatic effects and SOCs have been performed to investigate the relaxation processes in I-BODIPY after its photoexcitation to the state. The TSH MD simulations revealed that intersystem crossings occur on a time scale comparable to internal conversions and that after an initial phase of triplet population growth a “saturation” is reached where the ratio of the net triplet to singlet populations is about 4:1. The calculated triplet quantum yield of 0.85 is in qualitative agreement with the previously reported experimental singlet oxygen generation yield of 0.99 0.06.},

To reconcile these views, we draw on the behavioral theory of the firm and the technological evolution literature in hypothesizing firms&#39; local search as a mechanism by which firms&#39; accumulated knowledge affects their product performance. Firms&#39; in-house knowledge can expose them to an accumulated knowledge trap , as firms&#39; accumulated knowledge tends to escalate their local search for a solution to a new technological challenge, but the impact of the local search on performance is unlikely to be materialized. We maintain that firms&#39; accumulated knowledge can make them more prone to the accumulated knowledge trap before rather than after the dominant technology has emerged. We further hypothesize that prior exploratory experiences and suppliers&#39; outsourced component knowledge can reduce firms&#39; susceptibility to such a knowledge trap before the dominant technology emergence, but their moderating roles fade away after the dominant technology emergence. Data from the U.S. Hybrid Electric Vehicle drivetrain market support our hypotheses. Our findings enrich the current literatures on the behavioral theory of the firm and technological evolution while reconciling the contrarian views in the innovation literature.},

  abstract     = {Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains have experienced sustained impacts from unprecedented complex disruptions in different combinations and at different times. From an efficiency perspective, do these complex supply chain disruptions call for more complex risk management strategies? To answer this, we built an empirically grounded discrete event simulation model, the results of which were analyzed using data envelopment analysis. Results show that with unprecedented complex disruption patterns, a multi-strategy portfolio approach is usually less efficient than a single-strategy or a do-nothing approach unless the strategy portfolio has certain characteristics. The most efficient strategy portfolios typically consist of a moderate number of diverse strategies. Too many strategies in a portfolio can be problematic, leading to increased costs that outpace improvement in revenue and service level. Results illustrate that even a strategy that generally performs poorly can be part of a very good strategy portfolio and vice versa. This study provides nuanced and novel findings that contribute to the resolution of the literature debate about the value of multi-strategy portfolios in addressing complex disruption patterns. Highlighting the value of a strategy portfolio view, these insights help firms better prepare for the next complex and sustained global supply chain disruptions.},

On the one hand, lenient return policies have become an important part of retailers&#39; value propositions and play a significant role in stimulating consumer purchases. On the other hand, lenient return policies increase the volume of product returns, which hurts profitability. Motivated by observing an increase in restrictive changes to long-established lenient return policies, we investigate consumer reactions to such changes and their managerial implications. Through a series of experiments with diverse consumer samples, we find that restrictive changes, such as shortening return time windows or introducing restocking fees, decrease consumer trust in retailers and lead to lowered purchase, positive word-of-mouth, and loyalty intentions. We also find that providing managerial transparency, in the form of communicating the rationale for restrictive changes, can attenuate the negative consumer reactions to such changes. Moreover, rationales that emphasize the cost of handling returns versus blaming opportunistic and abusive returners are similarly effective. Our findings contribute to the growing academic literature on consumer return policy design and provide actionable insights to retail managers.},

It recognizes that suppliers also require capabilities to access buyer knowledge. However, we still know little about the role of innovation intermediaries—actors who are neither buyers nor suppliers, but still influence innovation processes and outcomes in supply networks. Our case-based research shows that intermediaries create workspaces for R&amp;D and experimentation, help to refine definitions of requirements and de-risk novel solutions, support contracting, and facilitate solution implementation. We contribute to research on supplier innovation by developing a model of intermediaries&#39; activities and underlying capabilities, and their impact on innovation sourcing outcomes. We elaborate the indirect capabilities theoretical perspective by introducing additional types of indirect capabilities for collaborative innovation in supply chains, and showing how these capabilities interrelate. We furthermore extend the literature on innovation intermediaries by elucidating hitherto unexplored capabilities for intermediation and adding insights regarding the contribution of intermediaries to open innovation processes.},

  abstract     = {Research in healthcare suggests that repeated interaction between a provider and a patient can support better decision-making, resulting in improved efficiencies. To date, these repeated interactions enabling continuity of care have not been studied in hospital inpatient settings. During a hospital stay, decisions related to patient treatment are usually made by two key decision-makers: the attending physician (AP) and the operating physician (OP). Under the single decision-making approach (S-DMA), the AP and OP are the same; in contrast, under the dual decision-making approach (D-DMA), the AP and OP are different. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend toward the use of D-DMA over S-DMA across U.S. hospitals owing to scheduling conflicts. Although research outside healthcare operations management has argued for benefits from both approaches, their impacts on a patient&#39;s hospital stay are unclear. In this study, we address this gap by investigating the effects of S-DMA and D-DMA on patient care outcomes in terms of patient length of stay (LOS), treatment cost, and mortality. Data for our study come from the state of Florida and involve 520,554 cardiology patients treated by 9483 APs and 18,398 OPs at 241 hospitals between 2014 and 2016. We account for both patient and physician selection issues when choosing a particular decision-making strategy. Our results suggest that, on average, using S-DMA is associated with reduced patient LOS and treatment cost but has no effect on mortality. We also find that S-DMA is more beneficial for patients with low comorbidity and low process uncertainty, whereas D-DMA is more beneficial for patients with high comorbidity and high process uncertainty. Our results are robust to alternative explanations. We demonstrate that a single decision-maker offers benefits in the context of healthcare delivery, but dual decision-makers may yield benefits when caring for patients with high comorbidity and high process complexity. We discuss the implications of these findings for appropriately deploying S-DMA and D-DMA in inpatient services.},

First, we adopt the least squares method without taking the data features into account to estimate the common break point and to see how the data features affect the asymptotic behaviors of the estimator. Then, an iterative least squares estimator of the common break point which accounts for the common factors in the estimation procedure is examined. Our theoretical results reveal that: (1) There is a trade-off between the overall break magnitude of the panel data and the long-range dependence for both estimators. (2) The second estimation procedure can eliminate the effects of common factors from the asymptotic behaviors of the estimator successfully, but it cannot improve the rate of convergence of the estimator in most cases. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results on finite-sample performance.},

We verify the stationarity and ergodicity of the couple process (comprising both the observed process and its conditional mean process) while also presenting several stochastic properties.

  abstract     = {The article will focus on vector autoregressive-moving average (VARMA) models with time-dependent coefficients (td) to represent general nonstationary time series, not necessarily Gaussian. The coefficients depend on time, possibly on the length of the series n , hence the name tdVARMA ( n ) for the models, but not necessarily on the rescaled time t / n . As a consequence of the dependency on n of the model, we need to consider array processes instead of stochastic processes. Under appropriate assumptions, it is shown that a Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is consistent in probability and asymptotically normal. The theoretical results are illustrated using three examples of bivariate processes, the first two with marginal heteroscedasticity. The first example is a tdVAR ( n ) (1) process while the second example is a tdVMA ( n ) (1) process. In these two cases, the finite-sample behavior is checked via a Monte Carlo simulation study. The results are compatible with the asymptotic properties even for small . A third example shows the application of the tdVARMA models for a real time series.},

We proposed a new eigenvalue ratio criterion for the number of factors in static approximate factor models. It considers a pooled squared correlation matrix which is defined as a weighted combination of the main observed squared correlation matrices. Theoretical results are given to justify the expected good properties of the criterion, and a Monte Carlo study shows its good finite sample performance in different scenarios, depending on the idiosyncratic error structure and factor strength. We conclude comparing different criteria in a forecasting exercise with macroeconomic data.},

The bootstrap replications are obtained via a SSA decomposition obtained using rescaled trajectories (RT-SSA), a procedure that is particularly useful in the analysis of time series that exhibit nonlinear, non-stationary and intermittent or transient behaviour. The theoretical validity of the RT-SSA bootstrap when used to approximate the sampling properties of a general class of statistics is established under regularity conditions that encompass a very broad range of data generating processes. A smeared and a boosted version of the RT-SSA bootstrap are also presented. Practical implementation of the bootstrap is considered and the results are illustrated using stationary, non-stationary and irregular time series examples.},

It has been known for a long time that unit root tests may be flawed when a series although stationary has a root close to unity. That motivated recent papers dedicated to autoregressive processes where the bridge between stability and instability is expressed by means of time-varying coefficients. The process we consider has a companion matrix A n with spectral radius ρ ⁡ ( A n ) &lt; 1 satisfying ρ ⁡ ( A n ) → 1 , a situation described as ‘nearly-unstable’. The question we investigate is: given an observed path supposed to come from a nearly unstable process, is it possible to test for the ‘extent of instability’, i.e. to test how close we are to the unit root? In this regard, we develop a strategy to evaluate and to test for : ‘ ’ against : ‘ ’ when lies in an inner -neighborhood of the unity, for some . Empirical evidence is given about the advantages of the flexibility induced by such a procedure compared to the common unit root tests. We also build a symmetric procedure for the usually left out situation where the dominant root lies around .},

This approach effectively transforms these complex stochastic equations into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that can be solved using the Newton method. Balancing polynomials are chosen for their ability to enhance stability and convergence, providing a more reliable and manageable framework for tackling challenging stochastic problems. The paper also includes a convergence analysis and error estimation for the proposed method. Additionally, the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through four numerical examples. The results obtained from this method are compared with the exact solution and those from other established techniques, including the block-pulse function method, the shifted Jacobi operational matrix (SJOM) method, and the shifted Jacobi spectral Galerkin (SJSG) method. These comparisons highlight the superior performance and accuracy of the proposed method. All numerical computations were performed using MATLAB.},

In addition, the changes in the pressure of the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid can cause changes to the pressure of the extracellular fluid which saturates the spinal cord. The finite element method can be used to solve the differential equations, which describe both how the cord deforms and changes in the pressure of the extracellular fluid but often this requires a large number of time-steps to obtain an accurate and stable numerical solution.

This makes finding more families of solitary wave solutions possible and better shows how the system changes over time. These techniques identify various traveling waves, such as periodic, kink, -shaped, bell-shaped, shock waves and others physical solutions. Some obtained solutions are graphically discussed to better visualize the wave phenomena connected to various symmetrical solitary wave solutions.

Compared with the traditional statistical methods, understanding dynamics of an infectious disease can better make people understand some global characteristics of epidemic and help in designing appropriate strategies to control diseases. Early studies of mumps mainly focused on deterministic models. However, environmental noises are inevitable during the spread of infectious diseases. This paper extends a mumps transmission model from a deterministic to a stochastic framework and explores the dynamical behaviors of the model by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Our model is a six-dimensional stochastic model. The construction of suitable Lyapunov functions is very challenging. Firstly, we show that this model has a unique global positive solution for any positive initial values. Secondly, we compute the basic reproduction numbers and present sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution and the extinction of the disease. Finally, we perform numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis for exploring the effect of some parameters and the white noises on the behavior of the model. The theoretical results can provide necessary guidelines to public health administrators for controlling and preventing diseases.},

The existence of weak solution is obtained by means of Faedo-Galerkin approximation and denseness argument. We employ the Riemannian geometry method and convex properties to establish the asymptotic decay rates for the energy. This is achieved through an intrinsic algorithm driven by solutions of an ODE. Moreover, we explore two simple models that aim to contribute to the understanding of how the boundary memory works. Additionally, we give an example of the vector field used to construct geometric multipliers under semilinear conditions.},

Sufficient conditions for the existence of a weak solution are also obtained, and under some restrictions on the oscillation of the intermediate coefficient, the maximal regularity of the solution is proved in the paper.

Based on the initial condition, a key threshold in the model, namely, the basic reproduction number R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ is obtained. Our focus is to investigate the impact of saturated immune delay on viral infection when CTLs are introduced at a constant rate. By constructing Lyapunov functionals, the stability conditions of equilibrium and equilibrium are established. Theoretical analysis indicates that equilibrium no longer remains stable and generates a Hopf bifurcation as immune delay changes. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the main theoretical results, and sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the impact of the parameters on the threshold. Through these simulations, the general patterns of dynamic behavior of the model are revealed. In particular, when and , the dynamics of the endemic equilibrium exhibit complex behavior.},

The existence and stability of positive equilibria and the bifurcation analyses are discussed. Our numerical outcomes entail that increased zooplankton growth due to additional food leads to the disappearance of phytoplankton species, while a significant drop in nutrient levels results in zooplankton extinction within the ecosystem. Notably, the refuge by phytoplankton has a tendency to terminate the persistent oscillations and stabilize the system. As seasonal stochasticity significantly influences the dynamics of planktonic system, so we introduce seasonality into environmental noise and certain model parameters. In this case, we analyze both the regularity and the dichotomy between persistence and extinction. The numerical evidences demonstrate periodic solutions, strong/weak persistence, and plankton extinctions resulting from stochasticity and/or seasonality. Furthermore, the seasonally forced noise, intriguingly, has the capacity to exert control over hyperchaos, yielding a distinctive pattern in plankton populations.},

In order to define a proper objective function for minimization by particle swarm optimization (PSO), the constrained problem is converted into an unconstrained one through the penalty method. Furthermore, the moving least square (MLS) technique is implemented to interpolate and approximate the derivatives appeared in the equation. The main problem for challenging this combined scheme is nonlinear transient convective–radiative heat transfer in existence of a magnetic field. To study the efficiency of the MLS, the results would be contrasted with those extracted by a finite difference method (FDM) based PSO approach. Through five distinctive examples, the evolutionary diagrams as well as temperature distributions found by different methods are displayed, and the effects of the constant parameters are investigated. Besides, the simulations of this research work clearly depict good agreements of the numerical results obtained by the suggested idea with those reported in literature.},

In addition, contact heterogeneity among individuals plays a significant role in cholera transmission. In this paper, we construct a multiscale coupled immuno-cholera model considering waning vaccine-induced immunity and hyperinfectious vibrios and utilize a nested approach to bridge within-host vibrio evolution and between-host cholera transmission on complex networks. The basic reproduction numbers and for the within- and between-host models are derived, respectively, and is validated to serve as a sharp threshold between extinction and persistence of cholera. Specifically, the global asymptotic stability of each feasible equilibrium for the between-host system is established by formulating appropriate Lyapunov functionals. Numerical simulations are performed to assess the influences of within-host vibrio dynamics and network topology on between-host cholera transmission dynamics. The results show that the equilibrium level of total infected individuals is a nonmonotonic function of vibrio growth rate, implying that hampering within-host vibrio growth by drug treatment during the outbreak could alter the long-term outcomes of cholera. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of network degree distributions increases the risk of cholera outbreaks, suggesting that isolation and supervision for infected individuals with high degrees are effective measures to prevent and control cholera transmission.},

Second, for the cases where the existing results are invalid to handle switched nonautonomous terms, a new conformable fractional-order Halanay inequality is obtained, which serves as a powerful tool in the analysis of quasi-synchronization of NCFCDNs. Then, by virtue of the obtained Halanay inequality, Lyapunov method, and periodically intermittent controller, sufficient conditions of exponential quasi-synchronization of NCFCDNs are derived. Our results allow nonautonomous terms to be switched during work time and rest time, which is more relaxing than the previous results. Finally, a simulation example is included to show the feasibility of the derived results.},

Thirdly, based on the proposed FDT stability and the stochastic analysis techniques, several sufficient conditions on FDT bipartite synchronization are derived by designing a novel QGIC strategy. Significantly, the designed controller is a unified form of periodic and aperiodic cases and is only activated in the work interval.

  abstract     = {For most systems, the appearance of Turing bifurcation means that it is possible to excite Turing–Turing bifurcation, thus inducing superimposed spatial patterns, multistable spatial patterns co-existing, and others.It is undoubtedly of interest to qualitatively analyze the structures and stability of these spatially heterogeneous solutions generated by Turing–Turing bifurcation. Therefore, in this paper, with the aid of the center manifold theory and the normal form method, for general partial functional differential equations with nonlinear diffusion, the third-order normal form is firstly derived. It is locally topologically equivalent to the primitive partial functional differential equations at the Turing–Turing bifurcation point. And then the explicit formulae for the coefficients in the normal form associated with three different spatial modes are presented. As an application, a predator–prey model with predator–taxis is considered. It is theoretically revealed that the system admits the coexistence of a pair of stable steady states with a single characteristic wavelength and the coexistence of four stable steady states with different single characteristic wavelengths. Further, the parameter regions in which these phenomena will arise are quantitatively given. It is illustrated that the self-diffusion of prey and predator–taxis complement each other to promote the formation for the spatially homogeneous distributions of populations.},

The work in the article is roughly divided into two parts. The first part, due to the change of conditions, we must consider the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the system. In the second part, we show that the original system driven by Lévy noise is reduced into an effective equation. To be more accurate, the fast component equation is averaged out, and there exists an effective process converging to the original stochastic parabolic equation. The main contribution is that the obtained results can extend the existing results from the Lipschitz condition to a weaker condition with a wider application scope, that is, the non-Lipschitz condition, and the driving process is Lévy noise, which seems new in the existing literature.},

First, the effects of system parameters on the supercritical pitchfork bifurcations are discussed in detail by applying the fast-slow separation method. Second, it is rigorously proved by the Melnikov method that chaotic vibration exists when the parameters of the uncontrolled system are selected above the threshold of chaos occurrence. By fine-tuning the system parameters, a criterion for designing the control parameters to make the Melnikov function non-zero is derived. In addition, the routes to chaos in controlled system are explored by bifurcation diagrams, largest Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, Poincaré maps, basins of attraction, frequency spectra, and displacement time series. The results indicate that by properly adjusting the displacement feedback coefficient and the amplitude of parameter excitation, the chaotic motion caused by increasing of the amplitude of external excitation and strength of distributed time delay can be effectively suppressed. This research result can provide theoretical support for exploring the potential chaotic motion of other types of oscillators.},

The same as the existing studies of inverse random source problems, some theoretical results of the corresponding direct and inverse problems have been investigated in this paper. The difference is that the source term is driven by time-fractional Brownian motion, and the spatial function in the source term needs to be determined. It has been found that, for different problems, the properties of the integrand in the corresponding stochastic integrals are distinct, which has a significant impact on the entire theoretical analysis. For the problem considered here, the lack of monotonicity in the integrand of the stochastic integrals makes the analysis more challenging.

The simultaneous decompositions of these two sets of quaternion matrices are established. Some practical algorithms for computing the decompositions are also presented. Using the equivalence canonical forms, some practical solvability conditions for two systems of generalized Sylvester-type quaternion matrix equations are derived in terms of the ranks of the coefficient matrices. The general solutions to the systems are also provided. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the results. The proposed simultaneous decompositions are applied to construct a new framework of color watermarks embedding. In this framework, five color watermarks can be embedded into one host image simultaneously with high efficiency. Moreover, a counterexample for the existence of the equivalence canonical form of the general matrix quaternity with the same row or column numbers is presented. The results extend the existing findings on the equivalence canonical forms of general matrix arrays.},

First, we apply the symmetry analysis and obtain the infinitesimal group of transformations involving some arbitrary parameters. Further, we classify the one-dimensional optimal algebra, and using that, we obtain the similarity variables, which consequently reduces the time fractional partial differential equation (FPDE) to fractional-order ordinary differential equation (FODE). Next, under the invariance condition, we construct exact solution for the given model and presented graphically. Furthermore, we derive the two-dimensional optimal systems and nonclassical symmetry for the governing equation. Finally, we study the nature of fluid flow through the foam by numerical simulation.},

  abstract = {Detecting statistical differences among functional dataset or streaming signal dataset is of interest to many diverse fields, including neurophysiology, imaging, biomedical engineering, and public health. For example in our study, our interest is to provide the guideline for detecting the lowest drug dosage level for glioblastoma as quickly as possible in which the intensity functional curves are different among dosage groups. However, such functional data often have unknown and nonlinear massive correlated curves that lead to difficulties in detecting their significant differences without explicit likelihood functions. Existing detecting procedures mainly test a linear, quadratic, or specific parametric form of departure and require explicit likelihood functions due to estimating specific models. In this paper, we propose a flexible detecting method to test any unknown functional departure in a generalized functional regression without estimating models. We develop our detecting method under a generalized semiparametric functional model framework in which the explicit likelihood function does not exist. We develop our detecting method using the approximated Bayes factor, a score-type test, and the estimating equations. The decision of rejecting (or not) the null hypothesis is made using the Frequentist p -values. We also studied the asymptotic properties of our method. We compare our detecting method to the alternative method regarding the type-I error and power under various simulation settings. We demonstrate the advantages of our method by applying two real datasets: functional data of drug-exposed glioblastoma cell line and diffusion tensor imaging tractography.},

  abstract = {Neural networks have been employed to identify materials of interest from hyperspectral data (generally imagery) based on their unique spectral signatures. This approach assumes that there is a single material that is standing out from the rest of the spectrum to be identified. However, pixels often contain more than one material, or a material of interest may itself be a mixture of multiple materials. Neural networks are only as good as the data used to train them, and it takes a great deal of work in the laboratory to identify, make, and measure all potential mixtures of interest. Thus, researchers often calculate synthetic spectra using algorithms with varying degrees of fidelity to the physics that govern the interactions between light and multiple materials. In this work, we have (1) adapted a neural network designed to identify mixture components from Raman spectroscopy to work with visible to near-infrared reflectance data and (2) tested three common mixture algorithms to determine the most accurate and least computationally expensive method to build synthetic training datasets. With our initial test dataset, we have achieved accuracies of &gt; 90% and found that the synthetic training dataset produced using the Hapke mixture model provides the best results.},

The unobservable variable is subject to a multiplicative distortion influenced by an unknown smoothing function dependent on a confounding variable. We introduce the conditional mean calibrated Greenwood statistic and its variants, including the coefficient of variation, to adapt to this complex situation. The asymptotic results we present showcase their effectiveness even when such distortions are present. Moreover, for general distributions of the unobserved variable, we extend the methodology by proposing calibrated-modified Greenwood statistics and the coefficient of variation. These methods are demonstrated to be asymptotically efficient under various assumptions about the distortion function. Furthermore, we conduct Monte Carlo simulation experiments to assess the performance of the proposed estimators and test statistics, during which we compare our proposed test statistics with existing ones. For illustrative purposes, these methods are then applied to analyze a real-world dataset. MSC2020 Classification: 62G05, 62G08, 62G20},

Identifying the differences in microbial taxa across two different health conditions is clinically important, as it can enhance our understanding of disease pathology from a microbiome perspective and potentially lead to preventive or therapeutic strategies. However, there are three main challenges for analyzing microbiome data, due to compositionality, sparsity, and high dimensionality of the relative abundances. Although a few two-sample tests have been proposed for analyzing microbiome data, the statistical power cannot be guaranteed as the true alternative hypothesis is unknown. To potentially address this issue, we propose an adaptive microbiome-based truncated test (AMTT) that produces high power for various alternative hypotheses. Simulation studies with a wide range of scenarios are conducted, the results indicate that AMTT is not only powerful in almost all the scenarios but also effectively controls type I error rates. Real data about Parkinson&#39;s intestinal microbiome is analyzed to demonstrate its practical performance.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number and complexity of advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks have significantly increased, posing major challenges for organizations in effectively detecting and mitigating these threats. Although various APT detection methods have been developed, current approaches still face limitations, such as poor generalization leading to high false alarm rates. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel ensemble learning model called MCG, based on the combination of three main components: multilayer perceptron (MLP), correlated recursion (CR) layer, and graph attention network (GAT). The MLP component extracts flow features from network traffic, the CR layer constructs the IP information network by grouping and linking network behaviors, and finally, the GAT layer analyzes relationships between IPs through an attention mechanism. The MCG model proposed in this article has demonstrated superior performance in APT detection by effectively leveraging the strengths of each component, enabling more accurate identification of abnormal behaviors and reducing false alarms. The experimental results, presented in Section 4.4, show that the MCG model significantly improves accuracy and outperforms traditional methods. This demonstrates that the proposed model not only makes significant theoretical contributions but also offers practical value, providing a more reliable and effective solution for early detection and warning of APT attacks.},

The objective of this study is to explore treatment-covariate interaction tests involving covariate-adaptive randomization. Without assuming a parametric data-generating model, we investigate usual interaction tests and observe that they tend to be conservative: specifically, their limiting rejection probabilities under the null hypothesis are typically strictly lower than the nominal level. To address this problem, we propose modifications to the usual tests to obtain corresponding valid tests with limiting rejection probabilities equal to the nominal level. Moreover, we introduce a novel class of stratified-adjusted interaction tests that are simple, more powerful than the usual and modified tests, and broadly applicable to most covariate-adaptive randomization methods. The results encompass two types of interaction tests: one involving stratification covariates and the other involving additional covariates that are not used for randomization. Our study clarifies the application of interaction tests in clinical trials and offers valuable tools for revealing treatment heterogeneity, crucial for advancing personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {In the era of big data, detecting outliers in time series data is crucial, particularly in fields such as finance and engineering. This article proposes a novel sequence outlier detection method based on the gated recurrent unit autoencoder with Gaussian mixture model (GRU-AE-GMM), which combines gated recurrent unit (GRU), autoencoder (AE), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and optimization algorithms. The GRU captures long-term dependencies within the sequence, while the AE measures sequence abnormality. Meanwhile, the GMM models the relationship between the original and reconstructed sequences, employing the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation to calculate the likelihood of each hidden variable belonging to each Gaussian mixture component. In this article, we first train the model with mean-squared error loss (MSEL), and then further enhanced by substituting it with quantile loss (QL), composite quantile loss (CQL), and Huber loss (HL), respectively. Next, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model through Monte Carlo experiments conducted under different error terms. Finally, the method is applied to Amazon stock data for 2022, demonstrating its significant potential for application in dynamic and unpredictable market environments.},

These include the high-dimensionality of the data, the high codimension in the ambient space of the data manifolds of interest, and that the structure of machine learning models may encourage classifiers to develop decision boundaries close to data points. This article proposes a new framework for studying adversarial examples that does not depend directly on the distance to the decision boundary. Similarly to the smoothed classifier literature, we define a (natural or adversarial) data point to be ( γ , σ)-stable if the probability of the same classification is at least γ $$ \gamma $$ for points sampled in a Gaussian neighborhood of the point with a given standard deviation σ $$ \sigma $$ . We focus on studying the differences between persistence metrics along interpolants of natural and adversarial points. We show that adversarial examples have significantly lower persistence than natural examples for large neural networks in the context of the MNIST and ImageNet datasets. We connect this lack of persistence with decision boundary geometry by measuring angles of interpolants with respect to decision boundaries. Finally, we connect this approach with robustness by developing a manifold alignment gradient metric and demonstrating the increase in robustness that can be achieved when training with the addition of this metric.},

  abstract     = {Viral load (VL) in the respiratory tract is the leading proxy for assessing infectiousness potential. Understanding the dynamics of disease-related VL within the host is of great importance, as it helps to determine different policies and health recommendations. However, normally the VL is measured on individuals only once, in order to confirm infection, and furthermore, the infection date is unknown. It is therefore necessary to develop statistical approaches to estimate the typical VL trajectory. We show here that, under plausible parametric assumptions, two measures of VL on infected individuals can be used to accurately estimate the VL mean function. Specifically, we consider a discrete-time likelihood-based approach to modeling and estimating partial observed longitudinal samples. We study a multivariate normal model for a function of the VL that accounts for possible correlation between measurements within individuals. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm which treats the unknown time origins and the missing measurements as latent variables. Our main motivation is the reconstruction of the daily mean VL, given measurements on patients whose VLs were measured multiple times on different days. Such data should and can be obtained at the beginning of a pandemic with the specific goal of estimating the VL dynamics. For demonstration purposes, the method is applied to SARS-Cov-2 cycle-threshold-value data collected in Israel.},

Defined as the area under the survival function up to a time horizon τ &gt; 0 $$ \tau &gt;0 $$ , the RMST can be interpreted as the life expectancy within the time interval [ 0 , τ ] $$ \left[0,\tau \right] $$ . In addition to its straightforward interpretation, the RMST allows for the definition of valid estimands for the causal analysis of treatment contrasts in medical studies. In this work, we introduce a non-parametric approach to model the RMST conditional on a set of baseline variables (including, e.g., treatment variables and confounders). Our method is based on a direct modeling strategy for the RMST, using leave-one-out jackknife pseudo-values within a random forest regression framework. In this way, it can be employed to obtain precise estimates of both patient-specific RMST values and confounder-adjusted treatment contrasts. Since our method (termed “pseudo-value random forest”, PVRF) is model-free, RMST estimates are not affected by restrictive assumptions like the proportional hazards assumption. Particularly, PVRF offers a high flexibility in detecting relevant covariate effects from higher-dimensional data, thereby expanding the range of existing pseudo-value modeling techniques for RMST estimation. We investigate the properties of our method using simulations and illustrate its use by an application to data from the SUCCESS-A breast cancer trial. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that PVRF yields accurate estimates of both patient-specific RMST values and RMST-based treatment contrasts.},

In this paper, we examine various Cox models for IPD-NMA and compare different approaches to modeling trial, treatment, and covariate effects. We employ multiple graphical tools and statistical tests to assess proportional hazard assumptions and discuss their implications. Additionally, we explore the application of extended Cox models when the proportional hazard assumption is violated. Practical guidance on interpreting and reporting NMA results is provided.

One of the challenges is the ability to assess the predictive value of a biomarker, i.e., the difference in primary outcomes between experimental and placebo arms above and below a certain threshold of the biomarker. Indeed, when the accumulated information is very limited and the sample size is small, preliminary conclusions about the predictive properties of the biomarker might be misleading. To date, the majority of investigations regarding the predictiveness of biomarkers were in the setting of moderate-to-large sample sizes. In this work, we propose a novel flexible approach inspired by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance in order to assess the predictiveness of a continuous biomarker in a clinical setting where the sample size is small. Via simulations we show that the proposed method allows to achieve a higher power to declare predictiveness compared to the existing methods under a range of scenarios, whilst still maintaining a control of the type I error at a pre-specified level.},

  abstract     = {In oncology clinical trials, tumor burden (TB) stands as a crucial longitudinal biomarker, reflecting the toll a tumor takes on a patient&#39;s prognosis. With certain treatments, the disease&#39;s natural progression shows the tumor burden initially receding before rising once more. Biologically, the point of change may be different between individuals and must have occurred between the baseline measurement and progression time of the patient, implying a random effects model obeying a bound constraint. However, in practice, patients may drop out of the study due to progression or death, presenting a non-ignorable missing data problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel joint model that combines time-to-event data and longitudinal data, where the latter is parameterized by a random change point augmented by random pre-slope and post-slope dynamics. Importantly, the model is equipped to incorporate covariates across the longitudinal and survival models, adding significant flexibility. Adopting a Bayesian approach, we propose an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for parameter inference. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to a longitudinal-only model via simulations and apply our method to a data set in oncology.

We construct a sequence of pose graphs that represent the spatial relations and temporal progression of a patient&#39;s posture over time. Each graph node corresponds to an estimated joint position, while the edges reflect the anatomical connections and their proximity. We propose a hypothesis testing procedure that deploys the Fréchet statistics to identify break points in time between regular gait and FOG episodes, where we model the central tendency and dispersion of the pose graphs in the presentation of graph Laplacian matrices by computing their Fréchet mean and variance. We implement binary segmentation and incremental computation in our algorithm for efficient calculation. The proposed framework is validated on two datasets, Kinect3D and AlphaPose, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting FOG from video data. The proposed approach that extracts matrix features is distinct from the prevailing pixel-based deep learning methods. It provides a new perspective on feature extraction for FOG detection and potentially contributes to improved diagnosis and treatment of PD.},

We assessed type I error rate control, power, and confidence interval coverage, where applicable, for a wide range of methods, including weighted log-rank tests, the MaxCombo test, summary measures such as the restricted mean survival time (RMST), average hazard ratios, and milestone survival probabilities, as well as accelerated failure time regression models. We found a trade-off between interpretability and power when choosing an analysis strategy under NPH scenarios. While analysis methods based on weighted logrank tests typically were favorable in terms of power, they do not provide an easily interpretable treatment effect estimate. Also, depending on the weight function, they test a narrow null hypothesis of equal hazard functions, and rejection of this null hypothesis may not allow for a direct conclusion of treatment benefit in terms of the survival function. In contrast, non-parametric procedures based on well-interpretable measures like the RMST difference had lower power in most scenarios. Model-based methods based on specific survival distributions had larger power; however, often gave biased estimates and lower than nominal confidence interval coverage. The application of the studied methods is illustrated in a case study with reconstructed data from a phase III oncologic trial.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid studies allow investigators to simultaneously study an intervention effectiveness outcome and an implementation research outcome. In particular, type 2 hybrid studies support research that places equal importance on both outcomes rather than focusing on one and secondarily on the other (i.e., type 1 and type 3 studies). Hybrid 2 studies introduce the statistical issue of multiple testing, complicated by the fact that they are typically also cluster randomized trials. Standard statistical methods do not apply in this scenario. Here, we describe the design methodologies available for validly powering hybrid type 2 studies and producing reliable sample size calculations in a cluster-randomized design with a focus on binary outcomes. Through a literature search, 18 publications were identified that included methods relevant to the design of hybrid 2 studies. Five methods were identified, two of which did not account for clustering but are extended in this article to do so, namely the combined outcomes approach and the single 1-degree of freedom combined test. Procedures for powering hybrid 2 studies using these five methods are described and illustrated using input parameters inspired by a study from the Community Intervention to Reduce CardiovascuLar Disease in Chicago (CIRCL-Chicago) Implementation Research Center. In this illustrative example, the intervention effectiveness outcome was controlled blood pressure, and the implementation outcome was reach. The conjunctive test resulted in higher power than the popular p value adjustment methods, and the newly extended combined outcomes and single 1-DF test were found to be the most powerful among all of the tests.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of seamless Phase II/III designs has grown in popularity as a strategy to potentially accelerate the drug development. Making well-informed decisions regarding the drug&#39;s potential and addressing important clinical inquiries at the conclusion of the exploratory phase has become a critical step. In response to the increased emphasis on dose optimization, it becomes logical to integrate treatment arm/dose selections into Phase II and implement corresponding design adjustments. Within this framework, employing a fixed sample size presents challenges due to limited information availability before the trial planning and elevated development risks. Furthermore, practical and feasibility considerations have led to the increased utilization of surrogate endpoints for making interim decisions. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for a seamless Phase II/III design involving multiple treatment arms, leveraging Bayesian predictive probability of success (PPoS) for both treatment arm selection and interim sample size re-estimation (SSR) using surrogate endpoints. The proposed design demonstrates improved performance, including a higher likelihood of selecting favorable treatment arm, increased overall statistical power, and reduced average event sizes and trial durations compared to traditional separate Phase II and III designs, as well as other seamless Phase II/III designs without SSR or of which treatment arm selection is based on conditional power. We also showcase the implementation of the proposed design through a case study in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).},

  abstract     = {Dietary intake data are routinely drawn upon to explore diet-health relationships, and inform clinical practice and public health. However, these data are almost always subject to measurement error, distorting true diet-health relationships. Beyond measurement error, there are likely complex synergistic and sometimes antagonistic interactions between different dietary components, complicating the relationships between diet and health outcomes. Flexible models are required to capture the nuance that these complex interactions introduce. This complexity makes research on diet-health relationships an appealing candidate for the application of modern machine learning techniques, and in particular, neural networks. Neural networks are computational models that can capture highly complex, nonlinear relationships, so long as sufficient data are available. While these models have been applied in many domains, the impacts of measurement error on the performance of predictive modeling have not been widely investigated. In this work, we demonstrate the ways in which measurement error erodes the performance of neural networks and illustrate the care that is required for leveraging these models in the presence of error. We demonstrate the role that sample size and replicate measurements play in model performance, indicate a motivation for the investigation of transformations to additivity, and illustrate the caution required to prevent model overfitting. While the past performance of neural networks across various domains makes them an attractive candidate for examining diet-health relationships, our work demonstrates that substantial care and further methodological development are both required to observe increased predictive performance when applying these techniques compared to more traditional statistical procedures.},

  abstract     = {In oncology studies, the assumption of proportional hazards is often questionable due to factors such as the presence of cured patients, a delayed treatment benefit, and possible treatment switching. The restricted mean survival time (RMST) has emerged as a valuable alternative summary measure to the hazard ratio (HR) in this scenario as it provides a clinically meaningful interpretation of treatment benefit without additional assumptions. As a commonly used primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of death or progression of disease (PD). However, PFS involves dual observation processes where, in practice, the exact death time is typically recorded, but PD is interval-censored. This feature is also present in other commonly used primary endpoints, including event-free survival, disease-free survival, and relapse-free survival. The conventional approach imputes the PD time with the right boundary of the time interval during which the PD occurs. This paper presents alternative estimation and inference approaches to estimate RMST with a mixture of right-censored and interval-censored data. Different approaches are explored by simulation under various plausible scenarios for oncology clinical trials with regard to the assessment frequency, randomness in the actual assessment times, and size of treatment effect. The choice of the restricted time point in RMST is also explored. The simulation results indicate that the RMST estimators that take account of the interval censoring inherent in the data are unbiased and more accurate than the conventional estimators, while the performance for two-group comparisons is comparable. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed estimators is contingent on the scheduled assessment plan and patients&#39; visit window.},

  abstract     = {Disparities in health or well-being experienced by minority groups can be difficult to study using the traditional exposure-outcome paradigm in causal inference, since potential outcomes in variables such as race or sexual minority status are challenging to interpret. Causal decomposition analysis addresses this gap by positing causal effects on disparities under interventions to other intervenable exposures that may play a mediating role in the disparity. While invoking weaker assumptions than causal mediation approaches, decomposition analyses are often conducted in observational settings and require uncheckable assumptions that eliminate unmeasured confounders. Leveraging the marginal sensitivity model, we develop a sensitivity analysis for weighted causal decomposition estimators and use the percentile bootstrap to construct valid confidence intervals for causal effects on disparities. We also propose a two-parameter reformulation that enhances interpretability and facilitates an intuitive understanding of the plausibility of unmeasured confounders and their effects. We illustrate our framework on a study examining the effect of parental support on disparities in suicidal ideation among sexual minority youth. We find that the effect is small and sensitive to unmeasured confounding, suggesting that further screening studies are needed to identify mitigating interventions in this vulnerable population.},

In doing so, we provide guidance to applied biostatisticians and clinical investigators on the use of IPTW in settings with competing risks. We examined three estimators of time-specific risk differences and relative risks: the weighted Aalen–Johansen estimator, an estimator that combines IPTW with inverse probability of censoring weights (IPTW-IPCWs), and a double-robust augmented IPTW estimator combined with IPCW (AIPTW-IPCW). The design of our simulations reflected clinically realistic scenarios. Our simulations found that all three estimators tended to result in unbiased estimations of time-specific risk differences and time-specific relative risks. However, the weighted Aalen–Johansen estimator and the AIPTW-IPCW estimator tended to result in estimates with greater precision compared to the IPTW-IPCW estimator. In our empirical analyses, we illustrated the application of these methods by estimating the effect of statin prescribing on the risk of subsequent cardiovascular death in patients discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.},

We also show that SVM is a continuous relaxation of the quadratic integer program for computing the largest balanced subset, establishing its direct relation to the cardinality matching method. Another important feature of SVM is that the regularization parameter controls the trade-off between covariate balance and effective sample size. As a result, the existing SVM path algorithm can be used to compute the balance-sample size frontier. We characterize the bias of causal effect estimation arising from this trade-off, connecting the proposed SVM procedure to the existing kernel balancing methods.

The proposed method approximates the time-varying covariate effect using nonparametric B-splines and aggregates the estimated nonparametric coefficients that share common patterns. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively handle various missing data patterns that frequently arise in mobile health data. Specifically, our method achieves subgrouping by flexibly accommodating varying dimensions of B-spline coefficients due to missingness. This capability sets it apart from other fusion-type approaches for subgrouping. The subgroup information can also potentially provide meaningful insight into the characteristics of subjects and assist in recommending an effective treatment or intervention. An efficient ADMM algorithm is developed for implementation.

To address these challenges, we propose to incorporate external information on the covariates into Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), a sum-of-trees prediction model that utilizes priors on the tree parameters to prevent overfitting. To incorporate external information, an empirical Bayes (EB) framework is developed that estimates, assisted by a model, prior covariate weights in the BART model. The proposed EB framework enables the estimation of the other prior parameters of BART as well, rendering an appealing and computationally efficient alternative to cross-validation. We show that the method finds relevant covariates and that it improves prediction compared to default BART in simulations. If the covariate-response relationship is non-linear, the method benefits from the flexibility of BART to outperform regression-based learners. Finally, the benefit of incorporating external information is shown in an application to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma prognosis based on clinical covariates, gene mutations, DNA translocations, and DNA copy number data.},

We propose a general framework for the assessment of complex heterogeneity in the strength of a surrogate marker, as well as corresponding parametric and semiparametric estimation procedures.

We additionally propose a formal test of heterogeneity and a method to identify a region of the covariate space where the surrogate is sufficiently strong. We examine the performance of our methods via a simulation study featuring varying levels of heterogeneity and use our methods to examine potential heterogeneity in the strength of a surrogate in an AIDS clinical trial.},

  abstract     = {A common concern in non-inferiority (NI) trials is that non-adherence due, for example, to poor study conduct can make treatment arms artificially similar. Because intention-to-treat analyses can be anti-conservative in this situation, per-protocol analyses are sometimes recommended. However, such advice does not consider the estimands framework, nor the risk of bias from per-protocol analyses. We therefore sought to update the above guidance using the estimands framework, and compare estimators to improve on the performance of per-protocol analyses. We argue the main threat to validity of NI trials is the occurrence of “trial-specific” intercurrent events (IEs), that is, IEs which occur in a trial setting, but would not occur in practice. To guard against erroneous conclusions of non-inferiority, we suggest an estimand using a hypothetical strategy for trial-specific IEs should be employed, with handling of other non-trial-specific IEs chosen based on clinical considerations. We provide an overview of estimators that could be used to estimate a hypothetical estimand, including inverse probability weighting (IPW), and two instrumental variable approaches (one using an informative Bayesian prior on the effect of standard treatment, and one using a treatment-by-covariate interaction as an instrument). We compare them, using simulation in the setting of all-or-nothing compliance in two active treatment arms, and conclude both IPW and the instrumental variable method using a Bayesian prior are potentially useful approaches, with the choice between them depending on which assumptions are most plausible for a given trial.},

  abstract     = {Stepped wedge cluster-randomized trial (CRTs) designs randomize clusters of individuals to intervention sequences, ensuring that every cluster eventually transitions from a control period to receive the intervention under study by the end of the study period. The analysis of stepped wedge CRTs is usually more complex than parallel-arm CRTs due to more complex intra-cluster correlation structures. A further challenge in the analysis of closed-cohort stepped wedge CRTs, which follow groups of individuals enrolled in each period longitudinally, is the occurrence of dropout. This is particularly problematic in studies of individuals at high risk for mortality, which causes nonignorable missing outcomes. If not appropriately addressed, missing outcomes from death will erode statistical power, at best, and bias treatment effect estimates, at worst. Joint longitudinal-survival models can accommodate informative dropout and missingness patterns in longitudinal studies. Specifically, within the joint longitudinal-survival modeling framework, one directly models the dropout process via a time-to-event submodel together with the longitudinal outcome of interest. The two submodels are then linked using a variety of possible association structures. This work extends linear mixed-effects models by jointly modeling the dropout process to accommodate informative missing outcome data in closed-cohort stepped wedge CRTs. We focus on constant intervention and general time-on-treatment effect parametrizations for the longitudinal submodel and study the performance of the proposed methodology using Monte Carlo simulation under several data-generating scenarios. We illustrate the joint modeling methodology in practice by reanalyzing data from the “Frail Older Adults: Care in Transition” (ACT) trial, a stepped wedge CRT of a multifaceted geriatric care model versus usual care in 35 primary care practices in the Netherlands.},

This approach allows for precise modelling of functional survival trajectories, leading to improved interpretation and prediction of survival dynamics across different groups.

When the interest is in the survival outcome, the conditional logarithm of the hazard function for an event is conventionally presumed to be linearly related over time to a set of explanatory covariates, among other terms. However, this hypothesis is quite restrictive and may yield misleading results. Our objective here is to easily check such a modeling assumption for any continuous fixed covariate. For this purpose, we examine the appropriateness of a nonparametric test criterion based on a penalty-modified version of the Akaike information criterion. An extensive numerical study is conducted to check the validity of the test within the joint modeling framework, while determining the extent to which the function embedding the continuous covariate deviates from linearity. Furthermore, once a deviation from linearity is detected, the improvement in the model&#39;s predictive performance is examined. The usefulness of the testing procedure is illustrated using a clinical trial with HIV-infected subjects. Specifically, our example focuses on properly accounting for the effect of nadir CD4 cell count within a predictive joint model for the time to immune recovery.},

A multitude of alternative methods have been developed which can reduce the risk of bias due to model misspecification. Investigators can now choose between many forms of matching, weighting, doubly robust, and machine learning methods. We review key concepts related to functional form assumptions and how those can contribute to bias from model misspecification. We then categorize the three frameworks for modeling treatment effects and the wide variety of estimation methods that can be applied to each framework. We consider why machine learning methods have been widely proposed for estimation and review the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. We apply a range of these methods in re-analyzing a landmark case study. In the application, we examine how several widely used methods may be subject to bias from model misspecification.

In this study, we introduce a statistical framework that effectively differentiates true zeros (lack of expression) from false zeros (dropouts). By focusing only on imputing the dropout zeros, we developed a new imputation tool, scRecover. Our approach utilizes a zero-inflated negative binomial framework to model the gene expression of each gene in each cell, enabling the estimation of zero-dropout probability. Additionally, we employ a modified version of the Good and Toulmin model to identify true zeros for each gene. To achieve imputation, scRecover is combined with other imputation methods such as scImpute, SAVER and MAGIC. Down-sampling experiments show that it recovers dropout zeros with higher accuracy and avoids over-imputing true zero values.

Consequently, two-group decision rules are unable to constrain the numbers of falsely discovered over-expressed or under-expressed genes respectively. We propose a general three-group model that allows dependence between the test statistics and develop a decision rule that separately controls the two types of false discoveries. We show that the optimal decision rule in our three-group model has a special monotonic structure. By making use of this monotonic structure, we can linearize the two-directional false discovery rate constraints. We prove that our decision rule optimizes the expected number of true discoveries while controlling the proportions of falsely discovered over-expressed and under-expressed genes at desired levels simultaneously.

Two existing methods corresponding to the difference method and product method of linear mediation analysis have been developed to perform MR-based mediation analysis using the inverse-variance weighted method (MR-IVW). Despite these developments, there is still a need for more rigorous, efficient, and precise MR-based mediation methodologies. In this study, we develop summary-data MR-based frameworks for causal mediation analysis. We improve the accuracy, statistical efficiency and robustness of the existing MR-based mediation analysis by implementing novel variance estimators for the mediation effects, deriving rigorous procedures for statistical inference, and accounting for widespread pleiotropic effects. Specifically, we propose Diff-IVW and Prod-IVW to improve upon the existing methods and provide the pleiotropy-robust methods (Diff-Egger, Diff-Median, Prod-Egger, and Prod-Median), adapted from MR-Egger and MR-Median, to enhance the robustness of the MR-based mediation analysis. We conduct comprehensive simulation studies to compare the existing and proposed methods. The results show that the proposed methods, Diff-IVW and Prod-IVW, improve statistical efficiency and type I error control over the existing approaches. Although all IVW-based methods suffer from directional pleiotropy biases, the median-based methods (Diff-Median and Prod-Median) can mitigate such biases. The differences among the methods can lead to discrepant statistical conclusions as demonstrated in real data applications. Based on our simulation results, we recommend the three proposed methods in practice: Diff-IVW, Prod-IVW, and Prod-Median, which are complementary under various scenarios.},

Our proposed algorithm in binary outcome misclassification models does not require gold standard labels and relies only on the assumption that the sum of the sensitivity and specificity exceeds 1. A label-switching correction is applied within estimation methods to recover unbiased effect estimates and to estimate misclassification rates.

This includes uncertainty in estimation for model-derived functionals such as exceedance probabilities. The latter are critical in a clinical diagnostic or decision-making setting.

We establish consistency and asymptotic normality results for the implied canonical parameter. Simulation studies and an illustration with data from an aging research study confirm that the proposed method performs comparably or better in comparison with GLDRM.

  abstract     = {Stepped wedge cluster randomized trials (SWCRTs) often face challenges related to potential confounding by time. Traditional frequentist methods may not provide adequate coverage of an intervention&#39;s true effect using confidence intervals, whereas Bayesian approaches show potential for better coverage of intervention effects. However, Bayesian methods remain underexplored in the context of SWCRTs. To bridge this gap, we propose two innovative Bayesian hierarchical penalized spline models. Our first model accommodates large numbers of clusters and time periods, focusing on immediate intervention effects. To evaluate this approach, we compared this model to traditional frequentist methods. We then extend our approach to account for time-varying intervention effects, conducting a comprehensive comparison with an existing Bayesian monotone effect curve model and alternative frequentist methods. The proposed models were applied in the Primary Palliative Care for Emergency Medicine stepped wedge trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Through extensive simulations and real-world application, we demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Bayesian models. Notably, the Bayesian immediate effect model consistently achieves the nominal coverage probability, providing more reliable interval estimations while maintaining high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, our proposed Bayesian time-varying effect model represents a significant advancement over the existing Bayesian monotone effect curve model, offering improved accuracy and reliability in estimation while also achieving higher coverage probability than alternative frequentist methods. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first development of Bayesian hierarchical spline modeling for SWCRTs. Our proposed models offer promising tools for researchers and practitioners, enabling more precise evaluation of intervention impacts.},

  abstract     = {Conducting a meta-analysis on a body of studies subject to publication bias is a type of post-selection inference that may invalidate findings. Therefore, analysts often run a hypothesis test to check for publication bias prior to conducting a meta-analysis. However, conducting meta-analyses conditional on the outcome of such preliminary tests is itself a form of post-selection inference. We investigate the effect on the outcome of a meta-analysis of a null finding at the preliminary stage. We find that in many situations there is no or little bias in the findings at the main stage.},

Test statistics are obtained as functionals of the difference between the identity and the Lorenz P–P plot, defined as the composition between the inverse unscaled Lorenz curve of one distribution and the unscaled Lorenz curve of the other. We determine upper bounds for such test statistics under the null hypothesis and derive their limit distribution, to be approximated via bootstrap procedures. We then establish the asymptotic validity of the tests under relatively mild conditions and investigate finite-sample properties through simulations. The results show that our testing approach can be a valid alternative to classic methods based on the difference in the integrals of the cumulative distribution functions, which require bounded support and struggle to detect departures from the null in some cases. The same approach can be extended to a family of fractional-degree stochastic orders, including the first order as a limiting case.},

The mathematical properties of the crude, null-effects, and adjusted sequence ratios (SR) are analyzed in the presence of prescription time-trends and unmeasured time-invariant confounding. The theoretical results are illustrated in a simulation study. The crude SR can be interpreted as an estimator of the hazard ratio (HR) of treatment when the allowed time between initiation of the treatment and the outcome drug is small. The HR can easily be estimated flexibly as a function of covariates, such as age and sex, using logistic regression. The crude SR implicitly adjusts for unmeasured time-invariant confounding, whereas the null-effects SR, and thereby the adjusted SR, make little sense unless treatment and outcome are strictly independent. The use of the adjusted SR should be abandoned. Another design should be used if it is infeasible to require treatment and outcome sufficiently close. The crude SR can be modeled flexibly with logistic regression to estimate covariate-dependent HRs or at least to test whether the HR depends on covariates.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a novel estimation framework for the multithreshold accelerated failure time model, which has distinct linear forms within different subdomains. One major challenge is to determine the number of threshold effects. We first show the selection consistency of a modified Bayesian information criterion under mild conditions. It is useful sometimes but heavily depends on the penalization magnitude, which usually varies from the model configuration and data distribution. To address this issue, we leverage a cross-validation criterion alongside an order-preserved sample-splitting scheme to yield a consistent estimation. The new criterion is completely data driven without additional parameters and thus robust to model setting and data distributions. The asymptotic properties for the parameter estimates are also carefully established. Additionally, we propose an efficient score-type test to examine the existence of threshold effects. The new statistic is free of estimating any potential threshold effects and is thus suitable for multithreshold scenarios. Numerical experiments validate the reliable finite-sample performance of our methodologies, which corroborates the theoretical results.},

To address this gap, we describe a class of estimands that explicitly acknowledge the multilevel data structure in SW-CREs and highlight three typical members of the estimand class that are interpretable. We then introduce four analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) working models to achieve estimand-aligned analyses with covariate adjustment. Each ANCOVA estimator is model-assisted, as its point estimator is consistent even when the working model is misspecified. Under the stepped wedge randomization scheme, we establish the finite population Central Limit Theorem for each estimator. We study the finite-sample operating characteristics of the ANCOVA estimators in simulations and illustrate their application by analyzing the Washington State Expedited Partner Therapy study.},

Both INARMA and INGARCH models exhibit an ARMA-like autocorrelation function (ACF). To achieve negative ACF values within the class of INGARCH models, log and softplus link functions are suggested in the literature, where the softplus approach leads to conditional linearity in good approximation. However, the softplus approach is limited to the INGARCH family for unbounded counts, that is, it can neither be used for bounded counts, nor for count processes from the INARMA family. In this paper, we present an alternative solution, named the Tobit approach, for achieving approximate linearity together with negative ACF values, which is more generally applicable than the softplus approach. A Skellam–Tobit INGARCH model for unbounded counts is studied in detail, including stationarity, approximate computation of moments, maximum likelihood and censored least absolute deviations estimation for unknown parameters and corresponding simulations. Extensions of the Tobit approach to other situations are also discussed, including underlying discrete distributions, INAR models, and bounded counts. Three real-data examples are considered to illustrate the usefulness of the new approach.},

However, it has limited suitability in practice, since it often fails to capture crucial characteristics of real-world networks. To check its adequacy, we propose a novel class of goodness-of-fit tests for homogeneous Erdös–Rényi models against heterogeneous alternatives that permit nonconstant edge probabilities. We allow for both asymptotically dense and sparse networks. The tests are based on graph functionals that cover a broad class of network statistics for which we derive limiting distributions in a unified manner. The resulting class of asymptotic tests includes several existing tests as special cases. Further, we propose a parametric bootstrap and prove its consistency, which avoids the often tedious variance estimation for asymptotic tests and enables performance improvements for small network sizes. Moreover, under certain fixed and local alternatives, we provide a power analysis for some popular choices of subgraph counts as goodness-of-fit test statistics. We evaluate the proposed class of tests and illustrate our theoretical findings by simulations.},

We develop a classical hypothesis test for completed epidemics which assesses whether or not there is significant within-group transmission during an outbreak. The test is based on time-ordered group labels of individuals. The null hypothesis is that of homogeneity of disease transmission among individuals, a hypothesis under which the discrete random vector of groups labels has a known sampling distribution that is independent of any model parameters. The test exhibits excellent performance when applied to various scenarios of simulated data and is also illustrated using two real-life epidemic data sets. We develop some asymptotic theory including a central limit theorem. The test is practically very appealing, being computationally cheap and straightforward to implement, as well as being applicable to a wide range of real-life outbreak settings and to related problems in other fields.},

Recently, the first inference methods for the MCV were proposed for general factorial designs. However, the inference methods are primarily derived for one special MCV variant while there are several reasonable proposals. Moreover, when rejecting a global null hypothesis, a more in-depth analysis is of interest to find the significant contrasts of MCV. This paper concerns extending the nonparametric permutation procedure to the other MCV variants and a max-type test for post hoc analysis. To improve the small sample performance of the latter, we suggest a novel bootstrap strategy and prove its asymptotic validity. The actual performance of all proposed tests is compared in an extensive simulation study and illustrated by real data analysis.

Confidence intervals resulting from these asymptotic approximations and the covariance bootstrap show good finite-sample coverage. In a simulation, the power of asymptotic as well as permutation tests for independence based on our correlation measures compares favorably with competing methods based on distance correlation or rank coefficients for functional dependence, among others. Moreover, for the bivariate normal distribution, our correlation coefficients equal the absolute value of the Pearson correlation, an attractive feature for practitioners which is not shared by various competitors. We illustrate the practical usefulness of our methods in applications to two real data sets.},

  abstract     = {Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models are used when apart from the main treatments, some covariates also affect the response variable. In this article, the problem of testing the homogeneity of treatment effects against ordered alternatives is addressed in a fixed effects one-way ANCOVA model when error variances are heterogeneous. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and two approximate tests based on the asymptotic distributions of some union-intersection type test statistics are proposed. A parametric bootstrap technique has been used to implement the LRT and its asymptotic validity is proved. A method to construct simultaneous confidence intervals is proposed. All the test procedures are further extended to the case of more than one covariate. The robustness of tests is also studied under departure from normality. Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed test procedures perform well in terms of achieving the nominal size value and good power values.},

A two-step estimation based on the likelihood function is widely used by researchers, but several theoretical and computational challenges remain to be addressed. First, it is unclear whether there is a unique global maximizer of the log-likelihood function, a seemingly simple but theoretically challenging question. The second challenge is the convexity of the log-likelihood function. Besides these two challenges in maximizing the likelihood function, we also study the theoretical property of the two-step estimation. Unlike many previous works, our results can apply to the non-twice differentiable covariance functions. In the simulation studies, three optimization algorithms are evaluated in terms of maximizing the log-likelihood functions.},

Its theoretical properties are now well understood in the simplified case where the sample curves are fully observed without noise. However, functional data are noisy and necessarily observed on a finite discretization grid. Common practice consists in smoothing the data and then to compute the functional estimates, but the impact of this denoising step on the procedure&#39;s statistical performance are rarely considered. Here we prove new convergence rates for functional principal component estimators. We introduce a double asymptotic framework: one corresponding to the sampling size and a second to the size of the grid. We prove that estimates based on projection onto histograms show optimal rates in a minimax sense. Theoretical results are illustrated on simulated data and the method is applied to the visualization of genomic data.},

  abstract     = {Data mining and natural language processing (NLP) are fundamental fields that interact in many ways. Text mining shares many topics, such as sentiment analysis and content understanding. Combining these two fields enables more efficient mining of text data and the extraction of valuable information. In particular, the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture has achieved success in image generation and has started to be used on text data. However, training GANs is fraught with difficulties due to the complexity of text data. Linguistic studies show important differences between languages. Language is characterized by fluidity, ambiguity, and context-sensitive interpretations, and text-generating GAN models can struggle to deal with these complexities. The interaction between data quality, language structure, and complex interpretation can lead to inconsistency and ambiguity in the text production of GAN models. These problems are particularly pronounced when complexities such as semantic subtleties, idiomatic expressions, and context-dependent usages come into play. Text generation is an area of GAN models used in NLP to generate language and enrich text-based applications. Work in this area can contribute to analyzing, classifying, and processing text data. Many methods and techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of text GANs. However, some problems may be encountered in the optimization of these methods. Therefore, it is essential to use optimized methods. In conclusion, GANs can be an important tool to improve text generation in NLP. Still, they require continuous research and innovation to deal with factors such as language complexity and data quality.},

This systematic review examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatically detect these conditions using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), we reviewed 74 carefully selected studies published between 2013 and August 2024 that used machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), or both of these two methods to detect neurological and mental health disorders automatically using EEG signals. The most common and most prevalent neurological and mental health disorder types were sourced from major databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore. Epilepsy, depression, and Alzheimer&#39;s disease are the most studied conditions that meet our evaluation criteria, 32, 12, and 10 studies were identified on these topics, respectively. Conversely, the number of studies meeting our criteria regarding stress, schizophrenia, Parkinson&#39;s disease, and autism spectrum disorders was relatively more average: 6, 4, 3, and 3, respectively. The diseases that least met our evaluation conditions were one study each of seizure, stroke, anxiety diseases, and one study examining Alzheimer&#39;s disease and epilepsy together. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were most widely used in ML methods, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dominated DL approaches. DL methods generally outperformed traditional ML, as they yielded higher performance using huge EEG data. We observed that the complex decision process during feature extraction from EEG signals in ML-based models significantly impacted results, while DL-based models handled this more efficiently. AI-based EEG analysis shows promise for automated detection of neurological and mental health conditions. Future research should focus on multi-disease studies, standardizing datasets, improving model interpretability, and developing clinical decision support systems to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing theoretical foundations, interdisciplinary challenges, and emerging advancements in rumor detection research, with a focus on integrating theoretical and computational approaches. Drawing on insights from computer science, cognitive psychology, and sociology, we explore methodologies, such as multimodal fusion, graph-based models, and attention mechanisms, while highlighting gaps in real-world scalability, ethical transparency, and cross-platform adaptability. Using a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis, we identify trends, methods, and gaps in current research. Our findings emphasize interdisciplinary collaboration to develop adaptable, efficient, and ethical rumor detection strategies. We also highlight the critical role of combining socio-psychological insights with advanced computational techniques to address the human factors in rumor spread. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of designing systems that remain effective across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts, enhancing their global applicability.

The goal of the current study is to conduct a scientometric analysis of scholarly literature published in the recent decade within the domain of ICT-assisted civil engineering. To achieve this, the study categorizes the civil engineering field into seven major subfields. It includes structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering, water resources engineering, environmental engineering, construction management, and urban planning and design. Employing CiteSpace as the analytical tool, the research offers insights into the intellectual foundations of the civil engineering. This is accomplished through reference co-citation analysis, cluster analysis, and burst reference analysis. The results demonstrate the adoption of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural networks in resolving complex civil engineering challenges that reflect the dynamism and diversity of the field.

To this end, encoding techniques are used to generate vectorial representations of process traces. Most of the PM literature provides trace encoding techniques that look at the control flow, that is, only encode the sequence of activities that characterize a process trace disregarding other process data that is fundamental for effectively describing the process behavior. To fill this gap, in this article we show 19 trace encoding methods that work in a multi-perspective manner, that is, by embedding events and trace attributes in addition to activity names into the vectorial representations of process traces.

Despite multiple studies about its significance, a comprehensive understanding of kernel function selection, particularly about model performance, still needs to be explored. Challenges remain in selecting and optimizing kernel functions to improve model performance and efficiency. The study investigates how gamma parameter and cost parameter influence performance metrics in multi-class classification tasks using various kernel-based algorithms. Through sensitivity analysis, the impact of these parameters on classification performance and computational efficiency is assessed. The experimental setup involves deploying ML models using four kernel-based algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Radial Basis Function, Polynomial Kernel, and Sigmoid Kernel. Data preparation includes text processing, categorization, and feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer, followed by model training and validation. Results indicate that Support Vector Machine with default settings and Radial Basis Function kernel consistently outperforms polynomial and sigmoid kernels. Adjusting gamma improves model accuracy and precision, highlighting its role in capturing complex relationships. Regularization cost parameters, however, show minimal impact on performance. The study also reveals that configurations with moderate gamma values achieve better balance between performance and computational time compared to higher gamma values or no gamma adjustment. The findings underscore the delicate balance between model performance and computational efficiency by highlighting the trade-offs between model complexity and efficiency.},

CLV is a critical approach to managing and organizing a company&#39;s profitability. With the vast availability of consumer data, business analytics (BA) tools and approaches, alongside CLV models, have been applied to gain deeper insights into customer behaviors and decision-making processes. Despite the recognized importance of CLV, there is a noticeable gap in comprehensive analyses and reviews of BA techniques applied to CLV. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a thorough survey of the state-of-the-art investigations on CLV models integrated with BA approaches, thereby contributing to a research agenda in this field. The review methodology consists of three main steps: identification of relevant studies, creating a coding plan, and ensuring coding reliability. First, relevant studies were identified using predefined keywords. Next, a coding plan—one of the study&#39;s significant contributions—was developed to evaluate these studies comprehensively. Finally, the coding plan&#39;s reliability was tested by three experts before being applied to the selected studies. Additionally, specific evaluation criteria in the coding plan were implemented to introduce new insights. This study presents exciting and valuable results from various perspectives, providing a crucial reference for academic researchers and marketing practitioners interested in the intersection of BA and CLV.},

  abstract     = {Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are essential for researchers to keep up with past and recent research in their domains. However, the rapid growth in knowledge creation and the rising number of publications have made this task increasingly complex and challenging. Moreover, most systematic literature reviews are performed manually, which requires significant effort and creates potential bias. The risk of bias is particularly relevant in the data synthesis task, where researchers interpret each study&#39;s evidence and summarize the results. This study uses an experimental approach to explore using machine learning (ML) techniques in the SLR process. Specifically, this study replicates a study that manually performed sentiment analysis for the data synthesis step to determine the polarity (negative or positive) of evidence extracted from studies in the field of agile methodology. This study employs a lexicon-based approach to sentiment analysis and achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 86.5% in identifying study evidence polarity.},

  abstract     = {To improve data analysis and feature learning, this study compares the effectiveness of quantum dimensionality reduction (qDR) techniques to classical ones. In this study, we investigate several qDR techniques on a variety of datasets such as quantum Gaussian distribution adaptation (qGDA), quantum principal component analysis (qPCA), quantum linear discriminant analysis (qLDA), and quantum t-SNE (qt-SNE). The Olivetti Faces, Wine, Breast Cancer, Digits, and Iris are among the datasets used in this investigation. Through comparison evaluations against well-established classical approaches, such as classical PCA (cPCA), classical LDA (cLDA), and classical GDA (cGDA), and using well-established metrics like loss, fidelity, and processing time, the effectiveness of these techniques is assessed. The findings show that cPCA produced positive results with the lowest loss and highest fidelity when used on the Iris dataset. On the other hand, quantum uniform manifold approximation and projection (qUMAP) performs well and shows strong fidelity when tested against the Wine dataset, but ct-SNE shows mediocre performance against the Digits dataset. Isomap and locally linear embedding (LLE) function differently depending on the dataset. Notably, LLE showed the largest loss and lowest fidelity on the Olivetti Faces dataset. The hypothesis testing findings showed that the qDR strategies did not significantly outperform the classical techniques in terms of maintaining pertinent information from quantum datasets. More specifically, the outcomes of paired t -tests show that when it comes to the ability to capture complex patterns, there are no statistically significant differences between the cPCA and qPCA, the cLDA and qLDA, and the cGDA and qGDA. According to the findings of the assessments of mutual information (MI) and clustering accuracy, qPCA may be able to recognize patterns more clearly than standardized cPCA. Nevertheless, there is no discernible improvement between the qLDA and qGDA approaches and their classical counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Reliable deployment of machine learning models such as neural networks continues to be challenging due to several limitations. Some of the main shortcomings are the lack of interpretability and the lack of robustness against adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper, we comprehensively review the possibilities and limits of adversarial attacks for explainable machine learning models. First, we extend the notion of adversarial examples to fit in explainable machine learning scenarios where a human assesses not only the input and the output classification, but also the explanation of the model&#39;s decision. Next, we propose a comprehensive framework to study whether (and how) adversarial examples can be generated for explainable models under human assessment. Based on this framework, we provide a structured review of the diverse attack paradigms existing in this domain, identify current gaps and future research directions, and illustrate the main attack paradigms discussed. Furthermore, our framework considers a wide range of relevant yet often ignored factors such as the type of problem, the user expertise or the objective of the explanations, in order to identify the attack strategies that should be adopted in each scenario to successfully deceive the model (and the human). The intention of these contributions is to serve as a basis for a more rigorous and realistic study of adversarial examples in the field of explainable machine learning.},
