  abstract     = {This paper introduces an innovative method for solving nonlinear stochastic Itô–Volterra integral equations using balancing polynomials and their associated operational matrices. This approach effectively transforms these complex stochastic equations into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that can be solved using the Newton method. Balancing polynomials are chosen for their ability to enhance stability and convergence, providing a more reliable and manageable framework for tackling challenging stochastic problems. The paper also includes a convergence analysis and error estimation for the proposed method. Additionally, the effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through four numerical examples. The results obtained from this method are compared with the exact solution and those from other established techniques, including the block-pulse function method, the shifted Jacobi operational matrix (SJOM) method, and the shifted Jacobi spectral Galerkin (SJSG) method. These comparisons highlight the superior performance and accuracy of the proposed method. All numerical computations were performed using MATLAB.},

In addition, the changes in the pressure of the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid can cause changes to the pressure of the extracellular fluid which saturates the spinal cord. The finite element method can be used to solve the differential equations, which describe both how the cord deforms and changes in the pressure of the extracellular fluid but often this requires a large number of time-steps to obtain an accurate and stable numerical solution. We present an alternative approach that uses a Fourier series method that avoids the need for using a time-stepping scheme and that can model how a pressure pulse affects the spinal cord.},

This method produces several solitary wave solutions to the current problem by supposing a series-form solution. The generalized -expansion method, on the other hand, builds on the simple -expansion method by adding more parameters to the series-form solution. This makes finding more families of solitary wave solutions possible and better shows how the system changes over time. These techniques identify various traveling waves, such as periodic, kink, -shaped, bell-shaped, shock waves and others physical solutions. Some obtained solutions are graphically discussed to better visualize the wave phenomena connected to various symmetrical solitary wave solutions. The fractional Benney–Lin equation&#39;s dynamics and wave characteristics may be better understood through these graphical depictions, which makes it easier to analyze the model&#39;s behavior in detail.},

Compared with the traditional statistical methods, understanding dynamics of an infectious disease can better make people understand some global characteristics of epidemic and help in designing appropriate strategies to control diseases. Early studies of mumps mainly focused on deterministic models. However, environmental noises are inevitable during the spread of infectious diseases. This paper extends a mumps transmission model from a deterministic to a stochastic framework and explores the dynamical behaviors of the model by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. Our model is a six-dimensional stochastic model. The construction of suitable Lyapunov functions is very challenging. Firstly, we show that this model has a unique global positive solution for any positive initial values. Secondly, we compute the basic reproduction numbers and present sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution and the extinction of the disease. Finally, we perform numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis for exploring the effect of some parameters and the white noises on the behavior of the model. The theoretical results can provide necessary guidelines to public health administrators for controlling and preventing diseases.},

Our focus is to investigate the impact of saturated immune delay on viral infection when CTLs are introduced at a constant rate. By constructing Lyapunov functionals, the stability conditions of equilibrium and equilibrium are established. Theoretical analysis indicates that equilibrium no longer remains stable and generates a Hopf bifurcation as immune delay changes. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the main theoretical results, and sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the impact of the parameters on the threshold. Through these simulations, the general patterns of dynamic behavior of the model are revealed. In particular, when and , the dynamics of the endemic equilibrium exhibit complex behavior.},

Furthermore, numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the RPZNN in accurately addressing the TVLME and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of convergence rate and robustness when compared to several traditional or state-of-the-art ZNN solvers. Additionally, the RPZNN solver also exhibits excellent capabilities in dynamic alternating current (DAC) computing and the 6-link planar robot manipulator (6PRM) path-tracking task, highlighting its potential for wide-ranging applications.},

First, we construct a new composite conjugate parameter with two parameters by employing a convex combination of classical conjugate parameters and their variants. Then, we use the spectral technique to guarantee that the search direction possesses the sufficient descent property independent of any line search. Additionally, we incorporate a new spectral gradient-based adaptive restart scheme to ensure the global convergence of the family under weak Wolfe line search and obtain iteration complexity results under Armijo line search. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on unconstrained optimization problems and image restoration applications to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed family.},

The existence and stability of positive equilibria and the bifurcation analyses are discussed. Our numerical outcomes entail that increased zooplankton growth due to additional food leads to the disappearance of phytoplankton species, while a significant drop in nutrient levels results in zooplankton extinction within the ecosystem. Notably, the refuge by phytoplankton has a tendency to terminate the persistent oscillations and stabilize the system. As seasonal stochasticity significantly influences the dynamics of planktonic system, so we introduce seasonality into environmental noise and certain model parameters. In this case, we analyze both the regularity and the dichotomy between persistence and extinction. The numerical evidences demonstrate periodic solutions, strong/weak persistence, and plankton extinctions resulting from stochasticity and/or seasonality. Furthermore, the seasonally forced noise, intriguingly, has the capacity to exert control over hyperchaos, yielding a distinctive pattern in plankton populations.},

In order to define a proper objective function for minimization by particle swarm optimization (PSO), the constrained problem is converted into an unconstrained one through the penalty method. Furthermore, the moving least square (MLS) technique is implemented to interpolate and approximate the derivatives appeared in the equation. The main problem for challenging this combined scheme is nonlinear transient convective–radiative heat transfer in existence of a magnetic field. To study the efficiency of the MLS, the results would be contrasted with those extracted by a finite difference method (FDM) based PSO approach. Through five distinctive examples, the evolutionary diagrams as well as temperature distributions found by different methods are displayed, and the effects of the constant parameters are investigated. Besides, the simulations of this research work clearly depict good agreements of the numerical results obtained by the suggested idea with those reported in literature.},

In addition, contact heterogeneity among individuals plays a significant role in cholera transmission. In this paper, we construct a multiscale coupled immuno-cholera model considering waning vaccine-induced immunity and hyperinfectious vibrios and utilize a nested approach to bridge within-host vibrio evolution and between-host cholera transmission on complex networks. The basic reproduction numbers and for the within- and between-host models are derived, respectively, and is validated to serve as a sharp threshold between extinction and persistence of cholera. Specifically, the global asymptotic stability of each feasible equilibrium for the between-host system is established by formulating appropriate Lyapunov functionals. Numerical simulations are performed to assess the influences of within-host vibrio dynamics and network topology on between-host cholera transmission dynamics. The results show that the equilibrium level of total infected individuals is a nonmonotonic function of vibrio growth rate, implying that hampering within-host vibrio growth by drug treatment during the outbreak could alter the long-term outcomes of cholera. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of network degree distributions increases the risk of cholera outbreaks, suggesting that isolation and supervision for infected individuals with high degrees are effective measures to prevent and control cholera transmission.},

Second, for the cases where the existing results are invalid to handle switched nonautonomous terms, a new conformable fractional-order Halanay inequality is obtained, which serves as a powerful tool in the analysis of quasi-synchronization of NCFCDNs. Then, by virtue of the obtained Halanay inequality, Lyapunov method, and periodically intermittent controller, sufficient conditions of exponential quasi-synchronization of NCFCDNs are derived. Our results allow nonautonomous terms to be switched during work time and rest time, which is more relaxing than the previous results.

Furthermore, the relationships between proposed convolutions and the OFrWD as well as OFrAF are also obtained. In addition, with the help of simulation, applications of OFrWD and OFrAF are established, such as designing multiplicative filters in the offset fractional Fourier transform (OFrFT) domain and detecting the parameters of single-component and multicomponent linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signals.},

Thirdly, based on the proposed FDT stability and the stochastic analysis techniques, several sufficient conditions on FDT bipartite synchronization are derived by designing a novel QGIC strategy. Significantly, the designed controller is a unified form of periodic and aperiodic cases and is only activated in the work interval. At last, two numerical simulations are offered to validate the superiority and effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

Therefore, in this paper, with the aid of the center manifold theory and the normal form method, for general partial functional differential equations with nonlinear diffusion, the third-order normal form is firstly derived. It is locally topologically equivalent to the primitive partial functional differential equations at the Turing–Turing bifurcation point. And then the explicit formulae for the coefficients in the normal form associated with three different spatial modes are presented. As an application, a predator–prey model with predator–taxis is considered. It is theoretically revealed that the system admits the coexistence of a pair of stable steady states with a single characteristic wavelength and the coexistence of four stable steady states with different single characteristic wavelengths. Further, the parameter regions in which these phenomena will arise are quantitatively given. It is illustrated that the self-diffusion of prey and predator–taxis complement each other to promote the formation for the spatially homogeneous distributions of populations.},

The work in the article is roughly divided into two parts. The first part, due to the change of conditions, we must consider the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the system. In the second part, we show that the original system driven by Lévy noise is reduced into an effective equation. To be more accurate, the fast component equation is averaged out, and there exists an effective process converging to the original stochastic parabolic equation. The main contribution is that the obtained results can extend the existing results from the Lipschitz condition to a weaker condition with a wider application scope, that is, the non-Lipschitz condition, and the driving process is Lévy noise, which seems new in the existing literature.},

Additionally, the result shows that θ ∈ [ 0 , 1 2 ) $$ \theta \in \left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right) $$ also demonstrates the same stability under more stringent conditions on stepsize.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the bifurcation, chaos, and active control of a mixed Rayleigh-Liénard oscillator with mixed time delays. First, the effects of system parameters on the supercritical pitchfork bifurcations are discussed in detail by applying the fast-slow separation method. Second, it is rigorously proved by the Melnikov method that chaotic vibration exists when the parameters of the uncontrolled system are selected above the threshold of chaos occurrence. By fine-tuning the system parameters, a criterion for designing the control parameters to make the Melnikov function non-zero is derived. In addition, the routes to chaos in controlled system are explored by bifurcation diagrams, largest Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, Poincaré maps, basins of attraction, frequency spectra, and displacement time series. The results indicate that by properly adjusting the displacement feedback coefficient and the amplitude of parameter excitation, the chaotic motion caused by increasing of the amplitude of external excitation and strength of distributed time delay can be effectively suppressed. This research result can provide theoretical support for exploring the potential chaotic motion of other types of oscillators.},

The pseudo-operational matrices are constructed utilizing bivariate Gegenbauer polynomials to approximate the solution of the mentioned equation. Then, using the collocation method and resultant matrices, the main equation is converted into a system of algebraic equations that can be solved by Newton&#39;s iteration method. Besides presenting a fast and accurate method, an error bound is determined in a Gegenbauer-weighted space for the residual function obtained from the proposed approach.

Here, we are interested in an inverse random source problem with biharmonic operator. The same as the existing studies of inverse random source problems, some theoretical results of the corresponding direct and inverse problems have been investigated in this paper. The difference is that the source term is driven by time-fractional Brownian motion, and the spatial function in the source term needs to be determined. It has been found that, for different problems, the properties of the integrand in the corresponding stochastic integrals are distinct, which has a significant impact on the entire theoretical analysis. For the problem considered here, the lack of monotonicity in the integrand of the stochastic integrals makes the analysis more challenging. Additionally, biharmonic operators will cause some difficulties in numerical calculations.},

The proposed method overcomes the singularity at the origin and handles both models with different-shaped factors. The convergence study of the proposed method for both models is also discussed in Banach space. Five models of interest are provided to test the validity and efficiency of the proposed method.

With the definition of a definite integral, the relation between the non-polynomial divided difference and non-polynomial B-spline functions is given in terms of integration. Also, we derive a general form of the Peano kernel theorem based on a generalized Taylor expansion with the integral remainder.

By separating the variables, the equation in two dimensions is reduced to the product of two time-dependent equations in one dimension that can be solved analytically.

  abstract     = {In the present study, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for nonlinear initial value problems and nonlocal boundary value problems associated with implicit fractional differential equations involving ( k , Ψ ) $$ \left(k,\Psi \right) $$ -Hilfer derivative operator. Furthermore, we explore the stability properties of these solutions in the sense of the Ulam–Hyers, Ulam–Hyers–Rassias, and their generalized stability concepts by proving and applying generalized Gronwall inequality. Lastly, we present the fractional R ⁢ C $$ \mathcal{RC} $$ electric circuit model as an example to show the practical applicability of our main results.},
