  abstract     = {To efficiently capture, activate, and transform small molecules, metalloenzymes have evolved to integrate a well-organized pocket around the active metal center. Within this cavity, second coordination sphere functionalities are precisely positioned to optimize the rate, selectivity, and energy cost of catalytic reactions. Inspired by this strategy, an artificial distal pocket defined by a preorganized 3D strap is introduced on an iron-porphyrin catalyst ( sc-Fe ) for the CO 2 -to-CO electrocatalytic reduction. Combined electrochemical, kinetic, and computational studies demonstrate that the adequate positioning of a carboxylate/carboxylic group acting in synergy with a trapped water molecule within this distal pocket remarkably enhances the reaction turnover frequency (TOF) by four orders of magnitude compared to the perfluorinated iron-tetraphenylporphyrin catalyst ( F 20 Fe ) operating at a similar low overpotential. A proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is found to be the key process responsible for the unexpected protonation of the coordinating carboxylate, which, upon CO 2 insertion, shifts from the first to the second coordination sphere to play a possible secondary role as a proton relay.},

  abstract     = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dual role in wound healing. They act as crucial signaling molecules and antimicrobial agents when present at moderate levels. However, excessive levels of ROS can hinder the healing process for individuals with diabetes. As a result, targeting ROS levels to maintain redox balance has become a promising strategy for improving wound recovery. Currently, no biomaterials have been reported to simultaneously up-regulate and down-regulate ROS to achieve broad-spectrum antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Inspired by the site-dependent effect of nanomaterials, a micron-sized ferroferric oxide (Fe 3 O 4 )/MXene (FM) heterojunction is synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The FM heterojunction could scavenge extracellular ROS by activating catalase (CAT)-like and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like nanozyme activities. Meanwhile, FM heterojunction could release ferric ions and ferrous ions by defect engineering to induce bacterial ferroptosis, up-regulating intercellular ROS, and lipid peroxidation. For applications in vivo, FM heterojunction is incorporated into the tips of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based microneedle (termed as GFM microneedle) using a two-step casting technique. The results showed that GFM microneedle combined with photothermal therapy could improve S. aureus -infected skin regeneration in diabetic rats. The effectiveness and safety of GFM microneedle are not less favorable than that of a commercial wound dressing. This study provides a proof-of-concept for heterojunction-mediated regenerative medicine via a site-dependent ROS-targeting strategy.},

Diverse reducing agents for Li supplements, such as quinone molecules, have been considered to homogenize the Li distribution in the cathode materials obtained after cycling; however, the detailed reaction mechanism is still unknown. Herein, the ideal electrochemical potential factor and reaction mechanism of the redox mediator 3,5-di-tert-butyl-o-benzoquinone (DTBQ) for the chemical relithiation of high-Ni-layered cathodes are elucidated. Here, 100% efficiency of DTBQ-assisted chemical relithiation is achieved by adjusting the direct immersion time of Li-deficient cathode electrodes. The reversible reaction features of the physical and chemical structures of both the regenerated cathodes and the DTBQ molecules are investigated using advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations. These findings emphasize the potential of redox-mediator-assisted chemical relithiation for realizing direct recycling processes and offer a facile and sustainable solution for battery recycling.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous clusters are gaining prominence as prospective hosts for sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs), but their efficacy is still affected by atomic coordination. Optimization of ion storage and charge transport can be achieved through high coordination and bimetallic configurations. Herein, high-coordination amorphous P 6 -Nb-W-P 5 (Nb/W-P) clusters are skillfully tailored by bridging Nb into the second shell of W in the W-P 5 configuration, nested in situ in conductive and stable N, P co-doped carbon nanospheres (Nb/W-P@NPC). Such clusters with high atom utilization can offer profuse Na + storage sites due to their high coordination. As an electron donor, Nb-bridging can subtly modify the electronic structure of clusters, and broaden the hybridization of d-p orbitals, thus improving charge transfer efficiency and fostering diversified active sites. Compared with the low-coordinated W-P L @NPC and the high-coordinated W-P@NPC, the reversible capacity of Nb/W-P@NPC upgrades to 556.3 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 , alongside exceptional cycling stability at high rates. When integrated into SIHCs, the high energy density and high-power output (223.6 and 9800 W kg −1 ) are achieved. By systematically exploring the effect of high coordination and bimetallic design on the storage efficacies of amorphous clusters, this study has greatly advanced the development of SIHC technologies.},

From the elemental/molecular ion distribution images, minerals such as pyroxene, ilmenite, feldspar, K-rich glass, silica, and silicate minerals are identified, along with their occurrence states and distribution results. More importantly, uncommon vesicle-like patterns are probed via TOF-SIMS, which may not be captured by conventional electron microscopy. The possible origins of vesicles are also proposed.

However, the rice interactome has barely been studied due to the lack of massive, reliable, and cost-effective methodologies. Here, the development of a barcode-indexed PCR coupled with HiFi long-read sequencing pipeline (BIP-seq) is reported for high throughput Protein Protein Interaction (PPI)identification. BIP-seq is essentially built on the integration of library versus library Y2H mating strategy to facilitate the efficient acquisition of random PPI colonies, semi-mechanized dual barcode-indexed yeast colony PCR for the large-scale indexed amplification of bait and prey cDNAs, and massive pac-bio sequencing of PCR amplicon pools. It is demonstrated that BIP-seq could map over 15 000 high-confidence (≈62.5% could be verified by Bimolecular fluorescence Complementation (BiFC)) rice PPIs within 2 months, outperforming the other reported methods. In addition, the obtained 23 032 rice PPIs, including 22,665 newly identified PPIs, greatly expanded the current rice PPI dataset, provided a comprehensive overview of the rice PPIs networks, and could be a valuable asset in facilitating functional genomics research in rice.},

The fluorinated polyimide (PI) membranes exhibited a promising balance between permeability and permselectivity for sour natural gas separation. To further improve the separation efficiency of fluorinated PI membranes, a melamine-copolymerization synthetic approach is devised that aims to incorporate melamine motifs with high sour gas affinity into the structure of the PI membranes. The fluorinated copolyimide membranes that are structurally engineered exhibited excellent solution-processability and enhanced sweet-mixed gas selectivity compared to their original PI membranes. Additionally, under a five-component sour mixed-gas feed, these melamine-copolymerized fluorinated PI membranes provided superior combined H 2 S and CO 2 removal efficiency in comparison to conventional glassy polymer membranes. The melamine-copolymerization strategy provides an easily operable and generally effective approach to developing performance-enhancing PI membranes for sour natural gas separation.},

  abstract     = {Ammonia (NH 3 ) is esteemed for its attributes as a carbon-neutral fuel and hydrogen storage material, due to its high energy density, abundant hydrogen content, and notably higher liquefaction temperature in comparison to hydrogen gas. The primary method for the synthetic generation of NH 3 is the Haber–Bosch process, involving rigorous conditions and resulting in significant global energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. To tackle energy and environmental challenges, the exploration of innovative green and sustainable technologies for NH 3 synthesis is imperative. Rapid advances in electrochemical technology have created fresh prospects for researchers in the realm of environmentally friendly NH 3 synthesis. Nevertheless, the intricate intermediate products and sluggish kinetics in the reactions impede the progress of green electrochemical NH 3 synthesis (EAS) technologies. To improve the activity and selectivity of the EAS, which encompasses the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen gas, nitrate, and nitric oxide, numerous electrocatalysts and design strategies have been meticulously investigated. Here, this review primarily delves into recent progress and obstacles in EAS pathways, examining methods to boost the yield rate and current efficiency of NH 3 synthesis via multidimensional structural optimization, while also exploring the challenges and outlook for EAS.},

Simultaneous discrimination and detection of ATP and biothiols offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of conditions such as epilepsy and liver injury. This study introduces the first fluorescent probe, BCR , designed for multifunctional detection of ATP, GSH, Hcy, and Cys. With outstanding optical properties, excellent biocompatibility, high selectivity, and superior sensitivity, probe BCR enables effective imaging of ATP and biothiol dynamics in vivo. Moreover, probe BCR successfully visualizes changes in ATP, GSH, Hcy, and Cys levels in a PTZ-induced epileptic zebrafish model and an APAP-induced mouse liver injury tissue section model.

  abstract     = {Pulmonary hypertension (PH) increases the mortality of preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). There are no curative therapies for this disease. Lung endothelial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme of the carnitine shuttle system, is reduced in a rodent model of BPD. It is unknown whether endothelial Cpt1a reduction causes pulmonary vascular (PV) remodeling. The latter can be the result of endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Here, endothelial cell (EC)-specific Cpt1a KO and WT mice (&lt;12 h old) are exposed to hyperoxia (70% O 2 ) for 14 days and allow them to recover in normoxia until postnatal day 28. Hyperoxia causes PH, which is aggravated in EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice. Upregulating endothelial Cpt1a expression inhibits hyperoxia-induced PV remodeling. Hyperoxia causes lung EndoMT, detected by immunofluorescence, scRNA-sequencing, and EC lineage tracing, which is further increased in EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice. Blocking EndoMT inhibits hyperoxia-induced PV remodeling. Male mice under the same high oxygen conditions develop a higher degree of PH than females, which is associated with reduced endothelial Cpt1a expression. Conclusively, neonatal hyperoxia causes PH by decreasing endothelial Cpt1a expression and upregulating EndoMT. This provides a valuable strategy for developing targeted therapies by upregulating endothelial Cpt1a levels or inhibiting EndoMT to treat BPD-associated PH.},

  abstract     = {Stem cell implantation holds promise for enhancing bone repair, but risks of pathogen transmission and malignant cell transformation should not be ignored. Compared to stem cell implantation, recruitment of endogenous stem cells to injured sites is more critical for in situ bone regeneration. In this study, based on the acidic microenvironment of bone injury, an HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel with a dual-control intelligent switch function is developed by incorporating stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1α), arginine carbon dots (Arg-CDs), and calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) into the oxidized hyaluronic acid/gelatin methacryloyl (HG) hydrogel. The acidic microenvironment triggers the first switch (Schiff base bond is broken between HG-AA 1:1 and SDF-1α) of HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel to continuously release SDF-1α. Compared to the neutral (pH 7.4) media, the cumulative release of SDF-1α in acidic (pH 5.5) media is ≈2.5 times higher, which enhances the migration and recruitment of endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The recruited MSCs immediately initiate the second switch and metabolize Arg-CDs into the bioactive nitric oxide (NO) in the presence of Ca 2+ , activating NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathway to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, the engineered HG-AA 1:1 -SDF-1α composite hydrogel shows promising potential to achieve “coupling osteogenesis and angiogenesis” for bone regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-performance dielectric materials remains a significant challenge due to the inherent trade-offs between high energy storage density and low energy loss. A central difficulty lies in identifying a suitable dipolar unit that can enhance the polarity and dielectric constant of the material while effectively suppressing the high energy losses associated with polarization relaxation, charge injection, and conduction. To address this, a novel strategy is proposed that introduces electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents on the benzene ring of polystyrene-based polymers, creating bulky dipole groups that are resistant to reorientation under an electric field. This approach mitigates relaxation losses associated with dipole reorientation and manipulates the band structure via substituent modification to suppress conduction losses. Additionally, the deformation of the π -electron cloud under an electric field enhances the dielectric constant and energy storage density. Ultimately, the optimized chlorostyrene-methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymer exhibits an 85% discharge efficiency and an energy storage density of 18.3 J cm − 3 , nearly three times that of styrene-based copolymers under the same conditions. This study introduces a new approach for designing high-energy density, low-loss polymer dielectric materials by precisely controlling electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects to modulate the distribution of π -conjugated electron clouds.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen usually exists in the form of diatomic molecules at ambient conditions. At high pressure, it undergoes a series of phase transitions from diatomic O 2 to O 8 cluster and ultimately dissociates into a polymeric O 4 spiral chain structure. Intriguingly, the commonly found cyclic hexameric molecules in other group VIA elements (e.g., S 6 and Se 6 ) are never reported in the bulk oxygen. Through extensive computational crystal structure search, herein it is reported that such hexameric O 6 molecules can exist in a stable compound HeO 3 above 1.9 TPa. The first-principles calculations reveal that, during the reaction by mixing oxygen with helium, the insertion of helium does not only expand the lattice volume, but also relieves the electron lone pair repulsion among diatomic O 2 , and thus significantly promoting the formation of cyclic O 6 molecules. Furthermore, the transition pathway calculations demonstrate that molecular O 2 is dissociated first, and then six oxygen atoms form a polymeric digital 2-shaped intermediate O 6 . Subsequently, each unstable intermediate O 6 decomposes into two intermedia O 3 trimers. Finally, O 3 trimers transform into cyclic O 6 molecules at high pressure. This study expands the known molecular forms of oxygen and suggests a route to the synthesis of intriguing cyclic O 6 molecules.},

However, the inherent characteristics of metal droplets, including high surface tension, elevated viscosity, and extreme temperatures, pose significant challenges for wetting and spreading on nonwetting substrates. Herein, this work proposes a strategy that employs a two-dimensional (2D) orthogonal ultrasonic field to construct a vibration deposition substrate with radial vibration amplitude gradient, thereby enhancing the wettability and adhesive strength of impacting metal droplets ejected by a piezoelectric micro-jet device. First, a 2D ultrasonic vibration device is designed based on the combination of longitudinal vibration modes. Additionally, oblique and circular vibration trajectories are synthesized. The vibration amplitude distributions and trajectories of the deposition substrate are verified utilizing the finite element method. Subsequently, the experimental results demonstrate that the contact angle is decreased by 24.7%, the spreading diameter is increased by 10.3%, and the adhesive strength is enhanced by 5.4 times compared to deposition on a static substrate. The 2D ultrasonic field facilitates the transition of metal droplets from a non-wetting state to a wetting state on the nonwetting substrate, which highlights the versatility and adaptability of ultrasonic strategy for expanding the applications of metal droplets.},

With the workflow, the interactions of single natural killer (NK) cells and single K562 tumor cells are investigated based on real-time images and single cell-pair proteomics. Notably, an identification depth of over 1000 protein groups in a single cell-pair is achieved, leading to the discovery of sub-clusters of NK cells with different functions and the identification of important biomarkers for cancer treatments.

Current treatment modalities for GD carry significant disadvantages, especially for pregnant or nursing women. As a novel extracorporeal therapeutic technique, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) shows great promise for treating GD; however, its low treatment efficacy impedes clinical application. In this study, a thyroid-targeted nano-bomb system (PD-PLGA@Si-Ab/PDA-I, PSAPI) is developed to enhance HIFU efficacy and improve therapeutic outcomes for GD. The core structure of PSAPI encapsulates a phase-transition material, perfluorohexane, and the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac within a poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and silica shell. A polydopamine coating enhances biocompatibility, while iodine loading and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies grafting ensure targeted delivery to the thyroid. Robust in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that PSAPI is highly biocompatible, accumulates in the thyroid within 24 h after administration, and significantly potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of HIFU, resulting in markedly reduced inflammatory responses. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a cellular defense mechanism activated in PSAPI-treated cells following HIFU irradiation, highlighting potential molecular targets for the future development of HIFU-sensitizing agents.

These compounds crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) space group, R 32, and are composed of distorted octahedral [CdX 3 F 3 ] (X═Cl or Br) units, which extend into a 3D framework. Remarkably, both compounds demonstrate strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) efficiencies—3.0 and 8.0 times that of KH 2 PO 4 for the Cl- and Br-containing analogs, respectively—with phase-matching behavior observed. The SHG efficiency is attributed to the highly distorted coordination environment of the polarizable d 10 Cd 2+ ions, with (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 benefiting further from Br&#39;s greater polarizability. Furthermore, these compounds exhibit wide bandgaps exceeding 4.2 eV, making them the first d 10 metal mixed halide systems incorporating fluoride that are suitable for UV NLO applications. With UV absorption cut-off edges as short as 203 nm for (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Cl 3 F 3 and 243 nm for (NH 4 ) 2 Cd 2 Br 3 F 3 , these materials represent a significant advancement in the development of UV-transparent NLO materials.

  abstract     = {Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are commonly used in polarization-sensitive photodetectors (PDs) for applications such as polarization imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication. Although various methods exist to adjust the polarization-sensitive photocurrent, a universal and effective approach for continuous control of MHPs’ optoelectronic and polarized properties is lacking. A universal strategy to electrically modulate the polarization ratio (PR) of self-powered polarized PDs using the ferro-pyro-phototronic effect (FPPE) in 2D perovskites is presented. By varying the amplitude and direction of ferroelectric polarization voltage, the built-in electric field in the heterojunction can be modulated, allowing for controllable PR regulation and adjustable polarization characteristics. Moreover, the polarized pyroelectric photoresponses are realized, significantly enhancing the responsivity, response speed of the polarized PDs. Both the pyroelectric currents and photocurrents exhibit obvious polarization characteristics. This method&#39;s versatility is demonstrated by creating three additional quasi-2D MHP ferroelectric-based polarized-sensitive PDs. A proof-of-concept for encrypted optical communication is achieved using the UV-sensitive PDs as light-sensing units. These findings highlight FPPE&#39;s potential to enhance ferroelectric device polarization control, enabling high-performance and self-powered polarization photodetection.},

  abstract     = {Lithium metal batteries are considered the holy grail for next-generation high-energy systems. However, lithium anode faces poor reversibility, unsatisfying cyclability and rate capability due to its uncontrollable plating/stripping behavior. While galvanostatic conditions are extensively studied, the behavior under more realistic application scenarios with variable inputs are less explored. Here, an in situ imaging platform using in-plane microdevice configurations is developed to effectively investigate Li plating/stripping behavior under dynamic conditions. This platform offers high detectivity for analyzing the nuclei size, density, distribution, and growth location, rate, and mode. It is for the first time revealed that nuclei density and growth locations remain constant and are solely determined by the initial nucleation overpotentials during dynamic plating. A transition in growth modes from uniform granular growth to tip-induced dendrite growth, and finally to directional growth among the dendrites is also observed. Guided by these findings, a dynamic plating protocol is proposed, which can greatly improve the Li reversibility and cycling stability. This work not only provides a novel approach to visualize the evolution of key nucleation and growth parameters, especially under variable inputs, but also offers valuable guidance for the future industrialization of metal batteries and the rational design of charging facilities.},

  abstract     = {The human visual nervous system excels at recognizing and processing external stimuli, essential for various physiological functions. Biomimetic visual systems leverage biological synapse properties to improve memory encoding and perception. Optoelectronic devices mimicking these synapses can enhance wearable electronics, with layered heterojunction materials being ideal materials for optoelectronic synapses due to their tunable properties and biocompatibility. However, conventional synthesis methods are complex and environmentally harmful, leading to issues such as poor stability and low charge transfer efficiency. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a more efficient, convenient, and eco-friendly method for preparing layered heterojunction materials. Here, a one-step ultrasonic method is employed to mix fullerene (C60) with graphene oxide (GO), yielding a homogeneous layered heterojunction composite film via self-assembly. The biomimetic optoelectronic synapse based on this film achieves 97.3% accuracy in dynamic visual recognition tasks and exhibits capabilities such as synaptic plasticity. Experiments utilizing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier–transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms stable π-π interactions between GO and C60, facilitating electron transfer and prolonging carrier recombination times.

  abstract     = {Recipients often suffer from hyperlactatemia during liver transplantation (LT), but whether hyperlactatemia exacerbates hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after donor liver implantation remains unclear. Here, the role of hyperlactatemia in hepatic IRI is explored. In this work, hyperlactatemia is found to exacerbate ferroptosis during hepatic IRI. Lactate-primed lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8) is determined to directly lactylate mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) at Lys100 and augments PCK2 kinase activity. By using gene-edited mice, evidence indicating that PCK2 exacerbates hepatic ferroptosis during IRI is generated. Mechanistically, PCK2 lactylate at Lys100 acts as a critical inducer of ferroptosis during IRI by competitively inhibiting the Parkin-mediated polyubiquitination of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (OXSM), thereby leading to metabolic remodeling of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) and the potentiation of oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. More importantly, targeting PCK2 is demonstrated to markedly ameliorate hyperlactatemia-mediated ferroptosis during hepatic IRI. Collectively, the findings support the use of therapeutics targeting PCK2 to suppress hepatic ferroptosis and IRI in patients with hyperlactatemia during LT.},

  abstract     = {Most current highly efficient organic solar cells utilize small molecules like Y6 and its derivatives as electron acceptors in the photoactive layer. In this work, a small molecule acceptor, SC8-IT4F, is developed through outer side chain engineering on the terminal thiophene of a conjugated 6,12-dihydro-dithienoindeno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDTT) central core. Compared to the reference molecule C8-IT4F, which lacks outer side chains, SC8-IT4F displays notable differences in molecule geometry (as shown by simulations), thermal behavior, single-crystal packing, and film morphology. Blend films of SC8-IT4F and the polymer donor PM6 exhibit larger carrier mobilities, longer carrier lifetimes, and reduced recombination compared to C8-IT4F, resulting in improved device performance. Binary photovoltaic devices based on the PM6:SC8-IT4F films reveal an optimal efficiency over 15%, which is one of the best values for non-Y type small molecule acceptors (SMAs). The resultant devices also show better thermal and operational stability than the control PM6:L8-BO devices. SC8-IT4F and its blend exhibit a higher relative degree of crystallinity and π coherence length, compared to C8-IT4F samples, beneficial for charge transport and device performance. The results indicate that outer side chain engineering on existing small electron acceptors can be a promising molecular design strategy for further pursuing high-performance organic solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a leading cause of evaporative dry eye disease, presenting a challenge for targeted treatment. Traditional topical ocular drug delivery methods often fail to effectively reach the meibomian glands (MGs). To address this, the study has developed a soluble microneedles (MN) patch comprising poly(vinyl alcohol), cyclodextrin modified polyacrylic acid, and new indocyanine green. This innovative MN patch facilitates the transdermal release of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonists, such as rosiglitazone in response to near-infrared ray induced temperature changes. By safely optimizing temperature, the patch effectively liquefied meibum lips, thereby alleviating duct obstruction while releasing the drug. MN patches exhibit sufficient mechanical strength for effective skin penetration, and its biosafety for eyelid application has been rigorously assessed in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic efficiency of rosiglitazone loaded MN (ROSI-MN) treatment for MGD is evaluated in high-fat mice. After three months of treatments, ROSI-MN administration significantly alleviated MGD clinical manifestations, including ocular surface damage, lipid deposits, glandular hypertrophy, and inflammatory infiltration, ultimately improving the microstructure and biofunction of MGs. In conclusion, the soluble MN patches hold promise as an effective drug delivery strategy for treating ocular surface diseases beyond MGD.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial plant diseases, worsened by biofilm-mediated resistance, are increasingly threatening global food security. Numerous attempts have been made to develop agrochemicals that inhibit biofilms, however, their ineffective foliar deposition and difficulty in removing mature biofilms remain major challenges. Herein, multifunctional three-component supramolecular nano-biscuits (NI6R@CB[7]@ β -CD) are successfully engineered via ordered self-assembly between two macrocycles [cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), β -cyclodextrin ( β -CD)] and ( R )-2-naphthol-based bis-imidazolium bromide salt (NI6R). This macrocycles-involved bactericidal material combines many advantages. 1) Alleviate the off-target movement of droplets on hydrophobic blade surfaces. 2) Enhance the biofilm-disrupting ability. At a low-dose of 4.44 µg mL −1 , the inhibition rate of biofilm formation reached 78.3%. At 35.5 µg mL −1 , the potency to remove mature biofilms reached 77.6%. 3) Efficiently hinder bacterial reproduction, swimming, extracellular polysaccharide production, extracellular enzyme secretion, and virulence to plants. These superior characteristics are undoubtedly transmitted to the in vivo control effect. At 200 µg mL −1 , this smart material exhibits superior control efficiencies of 49.6%/65.0%/85.4% against three kinds of bacterial diseases (rice leaf blight, citrus canker, and kiwifruit canker), respectively, surpassing the commercial bactericide—thiodiazole-copper-20%SC (33.6%/41.5%/43.2%) and NI6R (40.3%/51.2%/71.2%). Furthermore, NI6R@CB[7]@ β -CD is biosafe to non-target organisms. This study is instructive for constructing multifunctional agrochemicals in sustainable crop protection.},

Proteomic depth is serum concentration-dependent, and NPC exhibits powerful tolerance to ultra-high abundant proteins. In addition, protein-protein interactions (PPI), especially those involving albumin, play a pivotal role in promoting proteomic depth. Furthermore, a triple-protein assay is established to interrogate the relationship between protein binding affinity and concentration. NPC formation is a product of balancing binding affinity, concentration, and PPI.

  abstract     = {Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is the leading cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis worldwide. The neuroimmune interactions between peripheral and central immune systems in angiostrongyliasis remain unclear. In this study, significant infiltration of eosinophils, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and Ly6C monocytes is observed in the brains of AC-infected mice, with macrophages being the most abundant. RNA-seq and SMART-seq analysis of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and DNA sensor gene sets revealed a marked increase in Z-DNA binding protein 1 (Zbp1) expression in infected mice. Confocal microscopy, RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry further confirmed that Zbp1 is specifically upregulated in macrophages and microglia. Using Zbp1-knockout mice and flow cytometry, it is found that knockout of Zbp1 enhanced lymphocyte infiltration and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, modulating the immune microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) during AC infection. Mechanistically, it is revealed that in macrophage Zbp1 directly binds to receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) to promote its phosphorylation, subsequently facilitating the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl). The activated Zbp1-pRIP3-pMlkl axis leads to necroptosis and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1α, CXCL9, CXCL10 in macrophages, which recruits and activates immune cells. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of angiostrongyliasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.},

In the presence of the modulation (near-infrared) light, the Fermi level of the graphene channel shifts, allowing for the tuning of the visible light response speed as well as achieving a broad responsivity range from negative (-3376 A/W) to positive (3584 A/W) response. Based on this, logical operations are performed by adjusting the power of the modulation light superimposed with the signal light. This facilitates more covert, all-optical, high-speed encrypted communication. The ultrahigh tunability and nearly symmetric positive and negative photoconductivity of all-optical modulation photodetectors significantly enhance the computational capacity of neuromorphic hardware. The proposed device exhibits substantial advantages in applications requiring high fault tolerance for integrated sensing-computing （ISC） and high-resolution motion object recognition, providing insights for the development of next-generation high-bandwidth, low-power-consumption ISC devices.},

  abstract     = {DNA methylation plays a critical role in gene regulation, affecting cellular differentiation and disease progression, particularly in non-coding regions. However, predicting the epigenetic consequences of non-coding mutations at single-cell resolution remains a challenge. Existing tools have limited prediction capacity and struggle to capture dynamic, cell-type-specific regulatory changes that are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Here, Methven, a deep learning framework designed is presented to predict the effects of non-coding mutations on DNA methylation at single-cell resolution. Methven integrates DNA sequence with single-cell ATAC-seq data and models SNP-CpG interactions over 100 kbp genomic distances. By using a divide-and-conquer approach, Methven accurately predicts both short- and long-range regulatory interactions and leverages the pre-trained DNA language model for enhanced precision in classification and regression tasks. Methven outperforms existing methods and demonstrates robust generalizability to monocyte datasets. Importantly, it identifies CpG sites associated with rheumatoid arthritis, revealing key pathways involved in immune regulation and disease progression. Methven&#39;s ability to detect progressive epigenetic changes provides crucial insights into gene regulation in complex diseases. These findings demonstrate Methven&#39;s potential as a powerful tool for basic research and clinical applications, advancing this understanding of non-coding mutations and their role in disease, while offering new opportunities for personalized medicine.},

  abstract     = {Plants exhibit remarkable regenerative abilities under stress conditions like injury, herbivory, and damage from harsh weather, particularly through adventitious root formation. They have sophisticated molecular mechanisms to recognize and respond to wounding. Jasmonic acid (JA), a wound hormone, triggers auxin synthesis to stimulate root regeneration. Melatonin (MT), structurally similar to auxin, also significantly influences root induction, but its specific mechanism is unclear. Phytomelatonin&#39;s signal transduction is discovered in wound-induced root formation, identifying SlPMTR1/2 as phytomelatonin receptors, transmitting signals to SHOOT BORNE ROOTLESS 1 (SlSBRL1), a key regulator of wound-induced root regeneration, via the G protein α subunit 1 (SlGPA1). Additionally, SlPMTR1/2 is activated by JA, and targeted by SlMYC2. Overall, the specific mechanisms of phytomelatonin on wound-induced root regeneration is uncovered and revealed a crosstalk between phytomelatonin and JA, offering new insights into plant repair mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The integrated modulation of radiation and scattering provides an unprecedented opportunity to reduce the number of electromagnetic (EM) apertures in the platform while simultaneously enhancing communication and stealth performance. Nevertheless, achieving full-polarization, arbitrary amplitude, and phase modulation of radiation scattering remains a challenge. In this paper, a strategy that realizes space-time coding of radiation scattering within the same frequency band, which enables the simultaneous and independent modulation of amplitude and phase, is proposed. To address the limitations of the high sideband levels (SBLs) of conventional space-time-coding metasurfaces, a strategy comprising nonuniform modulation periods and stochastic coding is proposed. Consequently, beam scanning with ultra-low sidelobe levels (SLLs) and suppressed SBLs is achieved in the radiation mode (RM). In scattering mode (SM), in-band low scattering characteristics are achieved within the same operating frequency band as RM. A prototype of a space-time-coding radiation-scattering metasurface (STCRSM) is fabricated and the aforementioned functionalities are validated by measurements. Furthermore, the proposed strategy does not necessitate the utilization of optimization algorithms and exhibits low SLLs and low SBLs, which will make it flourish in RF stealth applications, such as covert communication systems.},

However, precisely controlling the doping concentration, doping location, and the mono-distribution of Mn 2+ ions in the large-micro-size CsPbCl 3 perovskite host is a formidable challenge. Here, the micro size CsPbCl 3 perovskite crystals (MCs) are reported with uniform Mn 2+ ions doping by self-assembly of Mn 2+ ions doped CsPbCl 3 perovskite NCs. The electron–phonon coupling strength is enhanced in the perovskite self-assembled CsPbCl 3 MCs, which remarkably accelerates the PL decay of Mn 2+ ions in room temperature. Furthermore, the phonon-involved PL emission splits to two peaks at low temperature of 80 K, due to the phonon emission and absorption-induced energy exchange for exciton recombination in Mn 2+ ions. These findings not only demonstrate a novel material system but also introduce a new theoretical framework for phonon-modulated PL manipulation in Mn 2+ -doped perovskite materials.},

  abstract     = {3D disordered fibrous network structures (3D-DFNS), such as cytoskeletons, collagen matrices, and spider webs, exhibit remarkable material efficiency, lightweight properties, and mechanical adaptability. Despite their widespread in nature, the integration into engineered materials is limited by the lack of study on their complex architectures. This study addresses the challenge by investigating the structure-property relationships and stability of biomimetic 3D-DFNS using large datasets generated through procedural modeling, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning. Based on these datasets, a network deep reinforcement learning (N-DRL) framework is developed to optimize its stability, effectively balancing weight reduction with the maintenance of structural integrity. The results reveal a pronounced correlation between the total fiber length in 3D-DFNS and its mechanical properties, where longer fibers enhance stress distribution and stability. Additionally, fiber orientation is also considered as a potential factor influencing stress growth values. Furthermore, the N-DRL model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional approaches in optimizing network stability while minimizing mass and computational cost. Structural integrity is significantly improved through the addition of triple junctions and the reduction of higher-order nodes. In summary, this study leverages machine learning to optimize biomimetic 3D-DFNS, providing novel insights into the design of lightweight, high-strength materials.},

However, the specific mechanisms and the protective effects of α-lipoic acid (LA) remain unclear. Therefore, this study employs network toxicology and network pharmacology to comprehensively analyze the hepatotoxic mechanism of As and the hepatoprotective mechanism of LA, and further verifies the mechanisms of peroxisomal β-oxidation and lipophagy in the process. The network analysis results show that As induces liver damage mainly through autophagy, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress, whereas LA exerts its hepatoprotective properties mainly by regulating lipid metabolism. Further verifications find that As inhibits SIRT1 expression, activates the P53 and Notch pathways, damages mitochondria, inhibits peroxisomal β-oxidation, increases lipid accumulation, and enhances lipophagy in the liver, while LA intervention alleviates As-induced lipid accumulation and enhances lipophagy by targeting SIRT1, ameliorating mitochondrial damage, enhancing peroxisomal β-oxidation, thereby alleviating As-induced liver damage. This study further clarifies the mechanism of As hepatotoxicity and provides a theoretical basis for LA as a potential hepatoprotective agent.},

In this study, the identification and characterization of an undescribed enzyme, PheG, from Phellinus igniarius ( P. igniarius ), which catalyzes the construction of a key C─C bond in the enzymatic synthesis of hispidin are reported. It is demonstrated in vitro that PheG generates hispidin by catalyzing C─C bond formation in the aldol condensation reaction. Based on these results, a plausible pathway for hispidin biosynthesis is proposed by utilizing the primary triacetic acid lactone (TAL, 2 ) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde ( 3 ). The mechanisms for the aldol condensation reaction of PheG are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations, density functional theory, and site-specific mutations. The locations of the key amino acid residues that catalyze the conversion of substrates 2 and 3 to hispidin at the active site of PheG-1 are identified.

In this study, a comprehensive microbiome-metabolite analysis using fecal and serum samples from patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and volunteers with risk factors for coronary heart disease and culture histology is performed, and identified the core strain Bacteroides ovatus ( B. ovatus ). Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments further demonstrated that the gut microbiota significantly influences AS progression, with B. ovatus alone exerting effects comparable to volunteer feces from volunteers. Notably, B. ovatus alleviated AS primarily by restoring the intestinal barrier and enhancing bile acid metabolism, particularly through the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a tryptophan-derived metabolite. IAA inhibited the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway in M1 macrophages, promoted M2 macrophage polarisation, and restored the M1/M2 polarisation balance, ultimately reducing aortic inflammation. These findings clarify the mechanistic interplay between the gut microbiota and AS, providing the first evidence that B. ovatus , a second-generation probiotic, can improve bile acid metabolism and reduce inflammation, offering a theoretical foundation for future AS therapeutic applications involving this strain.},

Here, it is found that the Meloidogyne javanica elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu) (MjEF-Tu) located in the nematode mitochondria is up-regulated and secreted into the host plant during nematode parasitism. MjEF-Tu interacts with the PRR Arabidopsis thaliana EF-Tu receptor (AtEFR), triggering the plant hallmark defence responses mediated by AtEFR. An 18-aa sequence (Nelf18) in the N terminus of the nematode EF-Tu contributes to the immunogenic activity. M. javanica water extract and mitochondrial extract also induce plant immunity sensed by AtEFR, owing to the presence of MjEF-Tu. In addition, Nelf18 enhances plant resistance to nematode, virus, and bacterial infections depending on AtEFR. These findings first demonstrate that mitochondrial proteins from pathogens can be secreted into hosts and function as a cross-kingdom signal and identified the first plant-parasitic animal-derived proteinaceous PAMP/PRR pair, providing novel insights into host-pathogen interactions.},

Targeting ferroptosis regulation presents a promising therapeutic strategy for OA; however, current research primarily focuses on single targets associated with ferroptosis. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanoparticle is developed by linking deferasirox (DEF) and pterostilbene (PTE) with thioketal and incorporating cerium ions (Ce), creating Ce@D&amp;P nanoparticles (NPs), which offer multitarget regulation of ferroptosis. The characteristics of Ce@D&amp;P NPs are evaluated and their therapeutic effects on IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes are verified. Results show that Ce@D&amp;P NPs reduce ROS levels, mitigate inflammation, chelate iron to inhibit ferroptosis, and balance extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses suggest that Ce@D&amp;P NPs exerted their effects by regulating oxidative stress and lipid metabolism in chondrocytes. To better treat destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA in mice, Ce@D&amp;P NPs via intra-articular injection are delivered. The results show that Ce@D&amp;P NPs alleviate cartilage matrix damage and slow OA progression. Overall, the findings indicate that Ce@D&amp;P NPs represent a promising multitarget drug delivery system, and Ce@D&amp;P NPs may be an effective strategy for OA treatment.},

  abstract     = {The past decade witnessed a surge in discoveries where biological systems, such as bacteria or living cells, inherently portray active polar or nematic behavior: they prefer to align with each other and form local order during migration. Although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, utilizing their physical properties to achieve controllable cell-layer transport will be of fundamental importance. In this study, the ratchet effect is harnessed to control the collective motion of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro. NPCs travel back-and-forth and do not specify head or tail, and therefore regarded as nematics alike liquid crystals. Ratchet and splay-shaped confinements are crafted to modulate collective cell dynamics in dense environments, while jamming is not explicitly spotted. The adaptation of an agent-based simulation further revealed how the ratchet&#39;s asymmetry and active forces from nematic order synergistically reinforce the directional cell flow. These findings provide insights into topotaxis in cell populations when restricted to crowded 2D ratchets and the mechanisms that regulate collective behavior of the cells.},

  abstract     = {Ischemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease and the leading cause of permanent disability worldwide. Recent studies have shown that stroke development and prognosis are closely related to abnormal tryptophan metabolism. Here, significant downregulation of 3-hydroxy-kynurenamine (3-HKA) in stroke patients and animal models is identified. Supplementation with 3-HKA improved long-term neurological recovery, reduced infarct volume, and increased ipsilateral cerebral blood flow after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis, functional blood vessel formation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) repair. Moreover, 3-HKA inhibited A1-like (neurotoxic) astrocyte activation but promoted A2-like (neuroprotective) astrocyte polarization. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-HKA inhibited AIM2 inflammasome activation after stroke, and co-labeling studies indicated that AIM2 expression typically increased in astrocytes at 7 and 14 days after stroke. Consistently, in co-cultures of primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes, 3-HKA promoted angiogenesis after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). AIM2 overexpression in astrocytes abrogated 3-HKA-driven vascular remodeling in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that 3-HKA may regulate astrocyte-mediated vascular remodeling by impeding AIM2 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, 3-HKA may promote post-stroke vascular remodeling by regulating A1/A2 astrocyte activation, thereby improving long-term neurological recovery, suggesting that supplementation with 3-HKA may be an efficient therapy for stroke.},

  abstract     = {Efficiency, stability, and cost are crucial considerations in the development of photovoltaic technology for commercialization. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a promising third-generation photovoltaic technology due to their high efficiency and low-cost potential. However, the stability of organohalide perovskites remains a significant challenge. Inorganic perovskites, based on CsPbX ₃ (X = Br − /I − ), have garnered attention for their excellent thermal stability and optoelectronic properties comparable to those of organohalide perovskites. Nevertheless, the development of inorganic perovskites faces several hurdles, including the need for high-temperature annealing to achieve the photoactive α-phase and their susceptibility to transitioning into the nonphotoactive δ-phase under environmental stressors, particularly moisture. These challenges impede the creation of high-efficiency, high-stability devices using low-cost, scalable manufacturing processes. This review provides a comprehensive background on the fundamental structural, physical, and optoelectronic properties of inorganic lead-halide perovskites. It discusses the latest advancements in fabricating inorganic PSCs at lower temperatures and under ambient conditions. Furthermore, it highlights the progress in state-of-the-art inorganic devices, particularly those manufactured in ambient environments and at reduced temperatures, alongside simultaneous advancements in the upscaling and stability of inorganic PSCs.},

  abstract     = {A novel additive method to boost the Seebeck coefficient of doped conjugated polymers without a significant loss in electrical conductivity is demonstrated. Perovskite (CsPbBr 3 ) quantum dots (QDs) passivated by ligands with long alkyl chains are mixed with a conjugated polymer in a solution phase to form polymer-QD blend films. Solution sequential doping of the blend film with AuCl 3 solution not only doped the conjugated polymer but also decomposed the QDs, resulting in a doped conjugated polymer film embedded with separated ions dissociated from the QDs. For the doped polymer-molten QD blend films with the optimal QD content, it is found that a greatly enhanced Seebeck coefficient is achieved compared to that of the doped polymer film without QDs, while the doping level and electrical conductivity are not significantly reduced by the QD incorporation. Consequently, the power factor is enhanced, reaching a remarkably high value of up to 401.9 µW m −1 K −2 (≈155% increase with the QDs). The applicability of this method to a variety of conjugated polymers is also demonstrated. The enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient is attributed to ion-induced local variations in the polymer work function, which generates an internal energy barrier for charge transport and causes an energy filtering effect.},

We designed and fabricated a one-dimensional (1D) water wave crystal to analogize the behavior of moving particles in water waves. This crystal exhibits a band structure with both positive (positive group velocity) and negative slopes (negative group velocity), exciting and directing the water waves to produce forward and backward radiating wakes through a mechanism similar to CR. Notably, the radiation angle is easily adjustable. This method of regulating water wave wakes holds potential applications in scattering cancellation-based wake stealth, navigation technology, and fluid dynamics for future offshore vessels.},

The primary challenge in modulating this gap has been the absence of a direct method for observing changes of the band gap in momentum space. In this study, advanced spatial- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy technique is employed to directly visualize the gap formation in bilayer graphene, modulated by both displacement fields and moiré potentials. The application of displacement field via in situ electrostatic gating introduces a sizable and tunable electronic bandgap, proportional to the field strength up to 100 meV. Meanwhile, the moiré potential, induced by aligning the underlying hexagonal boron nitride substrate, extends the bandgap by ≈20 meV. Theoretical calculations effectively capture the experimental observations. This investigation provides a quantitative understanding of how these two mechanisms collaboratively modulate the band gap in bilayer graphene, offering valuable guidance for the design of graphene-based electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Asia-prevalent malignancy, yet its genetic underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Here, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is conducted on NPC, leveraging gene expression prediction models based on epithelial tissues and genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from 1577 NPC cases and 6359 controls of southern Chinese descent. The TWAS identifies VAMP8 on chromosome 2p11.2 as a novel susceptibility gene for NPC. Further fine-mapping analyses pinpoint rs1058588, located within VAMP8 , as a causal variant through eQTL colocalization, and GWAS analyses across multiple cohorts, achieving GWAS significance (OR = 1.18, P = 3.09 × 10 −10 ). Functional assays demonstrate that VAMP8 exerts a tumorigenic role in NPC, enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth. Mechanically, it is uncovered that rs1058588 modulates VAMP8 expression by altering its binding affinity to miR-185 . Furthermore, the results show that VAMP8 interacts with DHX9 to facilitate the nuclear recruitment of p65, activating the NF-κB pathway. Collectively, the findings shed light on the genetic predisposition to NPC and underscore the critical role of the functional axis involving miR-185, VAMP8, DHX9, and the NF-κB pathway in NPC pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and animal models of depression, key pathological hallmarks include activation of microglia as well as atrophy and loss of astrocytes. Under certain pathological conditions, microglia can inflict damage to neurons and astrocytes. However, the precise mechanisms underlying how activated microglia induced astrocyte atrophy and loss remain enigmatic. In this study, a depression model induced by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is utilized. The results show that CSDS induces significant anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, along with notable astrocyte atrophy and apoptosis, microglial activation, and elevated levels of microglial interleukin-6 (IL-6). Subsequent studies demonstrate that IL-6 released from activated microglia promotes astrocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, the knockdown of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in microglia, which is implicated in the stress response, reduces stress-induced microglial activation, IL-6 release, and astrocyte apoptosis. Direct inhibition of microglia by minocycline corroborates these effects. The selective knockdown of IL-6 in microglia and IL-6 receptors in astrocytes effectively mitigates depression-like behaviors and reduces astrocyte atrophy. This study identifies microglial IL-6 as a key factor that contributes to astrocyte apoptosis and depressive symptoms. Consequently, the IL-6/IL-6R pathway has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of depression.},

In this study, an AOM-DSS-induced three-stage colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) model is constructed and targeted metabolomics analysis and pathway enrichment are performed, uncovering the metabolic changes in this transition. Spatial metabolic trajectories in the “normal-to-normal adjacent tissue (NAT)-to-tumor” transition, and temporal metabolic trajectories in the “colitis-to-dysplasia-to-carcinoma” transition are identified through K-means clustering of 74 spatially and 77 temporally differential metabolites, respectively. The findings reveal two distinct metabolic profile categories during the inflammation-to-cancer progression: those with consistent changes, either increasing (e.g., kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid) or decreasing (e.g., long-chain fatty acids, LCFAs), and those enriched at specific disease stages (e.g., serotonin). Further analysis of metabolites with consistent temporal trends identifies eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as a key metabolite, potentially exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects by inhibiting insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5). This study reveals novel metabolic mechanisms underlying the transition from UC to CAC and suggests potential targets to delay the progression.},

The optimization of the structural rigidity of the hybrid oxo-cluster network by thermal polymerization allows the precise formation of dispersed conductive cluster networks, enhancing the repeatability of the resistive switching with mechanical flexibility. The optimized memristor exhibits endurance of ∼10 4 cycles and stable memory retention performance up to 10 4 s, maintaining a high I ON / I OFF ratio of 10 4 under a bending radius of 2.5 mm. Moreover, the device achieves a pattern recognition accuracy of 97.44%, enabled by highly symmetric analog switching with multilevel conductance states.

This study explored the mechanisms by which METTL3 promotes renal allograft fibrosis, focusing on its role in the macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT). Using a comprehensive experimental approach, including TGF-β1-induced MMT cell models, METTL3 conditional knockout (METTL3 KO) mice, and renal biopsy samples from patients with CAR, the study investigates the involvement of METTL3/Smad3 axis in driving MMT and renal fibrosis during the episodes of CAR. We found that elevated m6A modification and METTL3 levels strongly correlated with enhanced MMT and increased fibrotic severity. METTL3 knockout (METTL3 KO) significantly increased the m6A modification of Smad3, decreased Smad3 expression, and inhibited M2-driven MMT. Smad3 knockdown with siRNA (siSmad3) further inhibited M2-driven MMT, while Smad3 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effects of METTL3 silencing, restoring M2-driven MMT and fibrotic tissue damage. Additionally, the METTL3 inhibitor STM2457 effectively reversed M2-driven MMT and alleviated fibrotic tissue damage in CAR. These findings highlight that METTL3 enhances M2-driven MMT in renal fibrosis during CAR by promoting the TGF-β1/Smad3 axis, suggesting that METTL3 is a promising therapeutic target for mitigating renal fibrosis in CAR.},

  abstract     = {Hemodynamic stabilization is crucial in managing acute cardiac events, where compromised blood flow can lead to severe complications and increased mortality. Conditions like decompensated heart failure (HF) and cardiogenic shock require rapid and effective hemodynamic support. Current mechanical assistive devices, such as intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), offer temporary stabilization but are limited to short-term use due to risks associated with prolonged blood contact. This research presents a novel proof-of-concept soft robotic device designed with the aim of achieving low-risk, medium-term counterpulsation therapy. The device employs a nature-inspired growing mechanism for potentially minimally invasive deployment around the ascending aorta, coupled with hydraulic artificial muscles for aortic compression. It demonstrated a maximum stroke volume of 16.48 ± 0.21 mL (SD, n = 5), outperforming all other non-pneumatic extra-aortic devices. In addition, in vitro tests with a mock circulation loop (MCL) show a drop in aortic end-diastolic pressure by 6.32 mmHg and enhance coronary flow under mild aortic stenosis, which attenuate the device&#39;s assistive effect. These findings highlight the device&#39;s strong potential for optimization as a promising solution to improve outcomes for hemodynamically unstable HF patients.},

  abstract     = {Polycyclic multiple resonance (MR) molecules reveal narrowband emission, making them very promising emitters for high color purity display. Nevertheless, they still have challenges such as aggregation-induced emission quenching and spectral broadening. Overcoming these obstacles requires an in-depth understanding of the correlations among the alterations in their geometries, packing structures, and molecular vibrations and their corresponding changes in their photoluminescence (PL) properties. Herein, it is demonstrated that high-pressure infrared, UV−visible absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopies can be combined with computational results to elucidate the influence of the subtle structural variations on the exciton‒vibration couplings and their PL properties. An ortho-carborane-decorated MR emitter (BNC) is a piezochromic molecule and exhibits emission enhancement under high pressure. A thorough analysis of the in situ experimental measurements and calculated results reveals that the pressure-induced changes in the exciton binding energy and exciton‒vibration couplings are responsible for the unusual piezochromism. This research provides insights into the structure‒fluorescence relationship and potential for high-pressure techniques to optimize MR materials for advanced organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) applications.},

Extracting meaningful physical insights from these datasets is challenging, particularly for multilayer heterogeneous nanoscale structures. In this paper, an unsupervised approach is presented to enhance AFM image contrast by analyzing the nonlinear response of a cantilever interacting with a material&#39;s surface using a wavelet-based AFM. This method simultaneously measures different frequencies and harmonics in a single scan, without the need for additional hardware and exciting multiple cantilevers&#39; eigenmodes. This developed AFM image contrast enhancement (AFM-ICE) approach employs unsupervised learning, image processing, and image fusion techniques. The method is applied to interpret complex multilayer structures consist of defects, deposited nanoparticles and heterogeneities. Its substantial capability is demonstrated to improve image contrast and differentiate between various components.

By inducing localized inflammation within tumors using lipopolysaccharide, it significantly amplify the recruitment of drug-laden neutrophils to tumor sites, irrespective of specific tumor markers. This strategy not only enhances targeted drug delivery but also triggers the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, further potentiating the anti-tumor effect. Crucially, this study demonstrates that potential systemic inflammatory responses can be effectively mitigated through neutrophil transfusion, ensuring the safety and clinical viability of this approach. In a murine breast cancer model, the method significantly impedes tumor growth compared to conventional treatments.

Herein, the potential of GH in disulfidptosis regulation, a novel form of programmed cell death induced by disulfide stress is explored. The omics results indicated that NRF2 signaling could be significantly activated by GH. The potential targets are associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and cell death. Moreover, both glutathione (GSH) metabolism and NADP + -NADPH metabolism are affected by GH, indicating the potential in disulfidptosis regulation. It is also observed that GH enhanced the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to disulfidptosis, which is dependent on the activation of NRF2-SLC7A11 pathway. GH significantly increased the levels of NRF2 and promoted the transcription of NRF2 target gene, SLC7A11, through autophagy-mediated non-canonical mechanism. Under the condition of glucose starvation, GH-induced upregulation of SLC7A11 aggravated uptake of cysteine, disturbance of GSH synthesis, depletion of NADPH, and accumulation of disulfide molecules, ultimately leading to the formation of disulfide bonds between different cytoskeleton proteins and disulfidptosis eventually. Collectively, the findings underscore the potential role of GH in promoting cancer cell disulfidptosis, thereby offering a promising avenue for the treatment of drug-resistant HCC in clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {Gram-positive bacteria pose significant threats to human health, necessitating the development of targeted bacterial detection and eradication strategies. Nevertheless, current approaches often suffer from poor targeting specificity. Herein, the study utilizes purple rice lixivium to synthesize biomass carbon dots (termed BCDs) with wheat germ agglutinin-like residues for precisely targeting Gram-positive bacteria. Subsequently, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules are grafted onto BCDs to yield FITC-labeled BCDs (termed CDFs), which can selectively and rapidly (≤5 min) stain bacterial cell wall and particularly target the peptidoglycan component. Strikingly, CDFs achieve superselective visualization of Gram-positive bacteria even in the presence of mammalian cells and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, protoporphyrin (PpIX) molecules are conjugated onto BCDs to yield PpIX-modified BCDs (termed CDPs), which can induce bacterial aggregation and in situ generate singlet oxygen for realizing enhanced antibacterial photodynamic therapy (PDT). At the minimum bactericidal concentration of CDPs (PpIX: 5 µg mL −1 ), CDP-mediated PDT disrupts bacterial structure and metabolism pathways, thereby affecting bacterial interactions to eradicate biofilms. Importantly, CDP-mediated PDT efficiently modulates antiinflammatory responses to promote wound healing in the bacteria-infected mice. This study underscores the significance of harnessing renewable and cost-effective biomass resources for preparing Gram-positive bacteria-targeting theranostic agents, which may find potential clinical applications in the future.},

By accessing the single-cell spatial transcriptome of over 25 million neuron cells across the entire macaque cortex, it is discovered that the distribution of neurons within cortical layers is highly non-random. Strikingly, over three-quarters of these neurons are located in distinct neuronal clusters. Within these clusters, different cell types tend to collaborate rather than function independently. Typically, excitatory neuron clusters mainly consist of excitatory-excitatory combinations, while inhibitory clusters primarily contain excitatory-inhibitory combinations. Both cluster types have roughly equal numbers of neurons in each layer. Importantly, most excitatory and inhibitory neuron clusters form spatial partnerships, indicating a balanced local neuronal network and correlating with specific functional regions. These organizational principles are conserved across mouse cortical regions. These findings suggest that different brain regions of the cortex may exhibit similar mechanisms at the neuronal population level.},

Here, by employing a tip-enhanced Raman thermal measurement approach, substantial phonon nonequilibrium in gallium nitride near sub-10 nm laser-excited hotspots is directly revealed for the first time. As further evidence, quantitative agreements between measurements and accurate first-principles-based phonon Boltzmann transport equation calculations are obtained. The large nonequilibrium is attributed to the strong Fröhlich coupling of electrons with longitudinal optical phonons and the large acoustic-optical phonon frequency gap in gallium nitride, which is further demonstrated in other common III-V semiconductors. This work establishes a viable approach for understanding nanoscale nonequilibrium phonon transport and can potentially benefit the future modulation of hot carrier dynamics.},

Optimizing the neutron spectrum can improve the production efficiency of 238 Pu, but currently, it is still a lack of knowledge about the optimal neutron spectrum for 238 Pu production. Genetic algorithms and burnup algorithms are combined to identify optimal neutron spectra for 238 Pu production under various irradiation times and flux levels, and build an optimal neutron spectrum database, which answers the questions “What is the optimal neutron spectrum for 238 Pu production?” and “What is the maximum efficiency for 238 Pu production” once and for all. This database can be referred to for determining the optimal neutron spectrum, guiding the neutron spectrum regulation process to improve the yield of 238 Pu. Moreover, these results find that the production method of in-reactor irradiation 237 Np not only has a higher yield but also achieves a higher purity of 238 Pu than that of in-reactor irradiation 241 Am, which conflicts with the traditional experiences, providing with previously unknown insights and helping break through the efficiency limit of traditional methods, maximizing 238 Pu production.},

Here, the impacts of plant species and diversity on ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in three agricultural soils are comprehensively investigated in a pot experiment. The results indicate that increased plant diversity reduces ARGs and MGEs abundance by 19.2%–51.2%, whereas plant species exhibit inconsistent and soil-dependent effects. Potential bacterial hosts harboring abundant ARGs have greater relative abundance than nonhosts, and both their richness and cumulative relative abundance are reduced by plant diversity. Notably, hosts inhibited by plant diversity present a greater relative abundance than the other hosts. The enriched compounds in root exudates due to plant diversity play a more important role in the metabolic network and contribute to rebalancing of the abundance of potential hosts and nonhosts. An independent test using pure organics reveals that higher resource diversity, resulting from increased plant diversity, reduces the relative abundance and mobility of abundant and high-risk ARGs. This study highlights the resource-mediated mitigation of the risks posed by ARG contamination and indicates that ensuring plant and resource diversity is a promising strategy for controlling ARGs in agroecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Dietary high salt intake is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies have identified a population of disease-associated astrocytes (DAA)-like astrocytes closely linked to amyloid deposition and tau pathology in an AD mouse model. However, the presence and role of these astrocytes in high-salt diet (HSD) models remain unexplored. In this study, it is demonstrated that HSD significantly induces enhanced reactivity of DAA-like astrocytes in the hippocampal CA3 region of mice, with this reactivity being critically dependent on neuronal tau pathology. Neuronal tau pathology activates adenosine A1R signaling, exacerbating tau pathology by inhibiting the Cers1 pathway, which sustains astrocyte reactivity. Additionally, neurons burdened with tau pathology promote astrocyte reactivity via releasing Proteins Associated with Promoting DAA-like Astrocyte Reactivity (PAPD), with Lcn2 playing a pivotal role. Knockout of Lcn2 or its receptor 24p3R significantly mitigates HSD-induced DAA reactivity and neuroinflammation. These findings suggest a vicious cycle between tau pathology and A1R signaling, driving DAA-like astrocyte reactivity. Targeting the Tau-A1R axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for reducing HSD-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative joint disease, prominently influenced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Although elevated IL-6 levels in joint fluid are well-documented, the uneven cartilage degeneration observed in knee OA patients suggests additional underlying mechanisms. This study investigates the role of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) in mediating IL-6 signaling and its contribution to OA progression. Here, significantly elevated IL-6R expression is identified in degenerated cartilage of OA patients. Further, in vivo experiments reveal that intra-articular injection of recombinant IL-6R protein or activation of gp130 (Y757F mutation) accelerates OA progression. Conversely, knockout of IL-6R or JAK2, as well as treatment with a JAK inhibitor, alleviates OA symptoms. Mechanistically, chondrocytes derived from degenerative cartilage exhibit impaired nuclear localization of SOX9, a key regulator of cartilage homeostasis. JAK inhibition stabilizes SIRT1, reduces SOX9 acetylation, and thereby facilitates SOX9 nuclear localization, promoting cartilage repair. Additionally, the JAK inhibitor-induced apoptosis in p21-positive senescent cells, and their targeted clearance successfully alleviates OA in p21-3MR mice. In conclusion, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which inhibiting the IL-6R/JAK2 pathway can alleviate OA. Furthermore, this study proposes targeting p21-positive senescent cells as a new therapeutic strategy for OA.},

  abstract     = {Focused ultrasound (FUS) has been widely adopted in medical and life science researches. Although various physical and biological effects of FUS have been well-documented, there is still a lack of understanding and direct evidence on the biological mechanism of therapeutic cell ablation caused by high-intensity ultrasound (HIFU) and the subsequent wound healing responses. This study develops an enclosed cell culture device that synergistically combines non-invasive FUS stimulation and real-time, on-the-fly live-cell imaging, providing an in vitro platform to explore short and long-term biological effects of ultrasound. The process, mechanism, and wound healing response of cell ablation induced by HIFU are elucidated, revealing a unique mechanism, termed ultrasound-inflicted cellular mechanolysis, that is mediated by growing subcellular cavitation air bubbles under confined contact with cells. This provides a previously unappreciated mechanism for understanding the biomechanical principles of ultrasound-based ablative therapy. A post-ablation phantom layer is also revealed that serves as a guiding cue for collective cell migration during wound healing, thereby providing a biomimetic model for studying wound healing after HIFU-inflicted damage. Together, this study provides theoretical and technological basis for advancing the understanding of the biological effects of ultrasound-based ablative therapy and inspiring clinically relevant applications in the future.},

  abstract     = {The advent of biomacromolecules antagonizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has revolutionized the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). However, frequent intravitreal injections of these biomacromolecules impose an enormous burden on patients and create a massive workload for healthcare providers. This causes patients to abandon therapy, ultimately leading to progressive and irreversible vision loss. In order to address this unmet clinical need, a noninvasive treatment for nAMD is developed. An optimized cell-penetrating peptide derivative, bxy Penetratin (bxyWP), is used to non-covalently complex with the anti-VEGF protein aflibercept (AFL) via reversible hydrophobic interaction. The interaction is crucial for AFL delivery, neither impairing the affinity of AFL to pathological VEGF, nor being interfered by endogenous proteins in tear fluids. AFL/bxyWP eye drops exhibit prolonged retention on the eye and excellent absorption into the posterior ocular segment following topical administration, with significant drug distribution to the retina and choroid. In a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model on cynomolgus monkeys, AFL/bxyWP eye drops efficiently reduce lesion size and leakage comparable to conventional intravitreal injection of AFL. These results suggest that AFL/bxyWP eye drops are feasible self-administered treatment for neovascular retinal diseases and potentially become a substitute for intravitreal injections.},

By combining the continuous activation of the Wnt pathway, through perfusion of CHIR99021, within a mild hypoxia environment, the expansion of hiPSC-CM as aggregates is maximized, reaching 4 billion of pure hiPSC-CM in 2L STB. In particular, the importance of i) controlling the dissolved oxygen at 10% O 2 to reduce reactive oxygen species production and upregulate genes involved in cell proliferation, resulting in higher expansion rates (tenfold) compared to normoxic conditions, and ii) maintaining constant power input per volume as a scale-up criteria is demonstrated. After expansion, hiPSC-CM further mature in culture, revealing more mature transcriptional signatures, higher sarcomere alignment and improved calcium handling.

  abstract     = {3D porous carbon electrodes have attracted significant attention for advancing compressible supercapacitors (SCs) in flexible electronics. The micro- and nanoscale architecture critically influences the mechanical and electrochemical performance of these electrodes. However, achieving a balance between high compressive strength, electrochemical stability, and cost-effective sustainable production remains challenging. Here, a superelastic wood nanocarbon sponge (WNCS) with a wrinkled multilayer structure is developed via a facile “top–down” design on natural wood. These unique wrinkled nanolayers effectively alleviate stress concentration through elastic deformation, resulting in a high compressive strength of 580.6 kPa at 70% reversible strain. The significantly increased specific surface area, coupled with abundant micro-mesopores and highly graphitized nanocarbon, promotes rapid ion/electron transport, enabling the WNCS to achieve an ultrahigh capacitance of 4.21 F cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2 , along with excellent cyclic stability and rate capability. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using a WNCS anode and a NiCo-layered double hydroxide cathode retains 71.8% of its initial capacitance after 1000 compression cycles and withstands stress up to 1.03 MPa without capacitance degradation. This sustainable, cost-effective WNCS shows great promise for flexible, compressible, and wearable electrochemical energy systems.},

The membrane serves as the interface between the circulating air-flow and the ambient water, preventing water flux while allowing an oxygen flux across the membrane, driven by a partial oxygen pressure gradient. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, a prototype system was built based on guidelines derived from a mathematical model that was developed to describe the oxygen transfer process. A computational fluid dynamics model is developed and validated against the measurements from the prototype, resulting in a digital twin. The analysis indicates that the proposed power supply system has the potential to be superior to any battery-based solution currently available.},

Here, a new catalyst with an inverse structure of a supported metal catalyst that consists of metallic iron particles loaded with an aluminum hydride species is reported. The iron catalyst is readily prepared from an α-Fe 2 O 3 precursor and ammonia could be synthesized at more than twice the ammonia synthesis rate/catalyst volume of the conventional industrial iron catalyst, even though the specific surface area of the former is only half that of the latter. In addition, ammonia synthesis over the catalyst is observed with a small apparent activation energy at 50 °C. Mechanistic studies suggested that an increase in the active sites with strong electron-donating capability on the iron catalyst significantly increased the ammonia synthesis rate/catalyst surface area, which resulted in high catalytic activity/catalyst volume.},

Most in vitro systems used to study nuclear deformations impose whole-cell confinement that mimics the physical crowding experienced by cells during 3D migration through tissues. Such systems, however, do not reproduce the types of nuclear deformations expected to occur in cells that line tissues such as endothelial or epithelial cells whose physical confinement stems principally from the topography of their underlying basement membrane. Here, it is shown that endothelial cells and myoblasts cultured on microgroove substrates that mimic the anisotropic topography of the basement membrane exhibit large-scale 3D nuclear deformations, with partial to complete nuclear penetration into the microgrooves. These deformations do not lead to significant DNA damage and are dynamic with nuclei cyclically entering and exiting the microgrooves. Atomic force microscopy measurements show that these deformation cycles are accompanied by transient changes in perinuclear stiffness. Interestingly, nuclear penetration into the grooves is driven principally by cell-substrate adhesion stresses, with a limited need for cytoskeleton-associated forces. Finally, it is demonstrated that myoblasts from laminopathy patients exhibit abnormal nuclear deformations on microgrooves, raising the possibility of using microgroove substrates as a novel functional diagnostic platform for pathologies that involve abnormal nuclear mechanics.},

  abstract     = {Vascular calcification is a highly regulated process in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is strongly correlated with morbidity and mortality, especially in the adverse stage of vascular remodeling after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). However, the pathogenesis of vascular graft calcification, particularly the role of endothelial-smooth muscle cell interaction, is still unclear. To test how ECs interact with SMCs in artery grafts, single-cell analysis of wild-type mice is first performed using an arterial isograft mouse model and found robust cytokine-mediated signaling pathway activation and SMC proliferation, together with upregulated endothelial tripartite motif 35 (TRIM35) expression. Unexpectedly, severe SMC calcification in artery grafts is found in TRIM35 conditional endothelial knockout (cKO) mice. Calcified medium (comprising calcium chloride and beta-glycerophosphate)-induced calcium deposition in vitro is also found in SMCs cocultured with TRIM35 knockout endothelium. This extraordinary phenomenon is further confirmed to be induced by increased MMP10 secretion. Mechanistically, endothelial TRIM35 inhibits MMP10 expression and secretion by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of RelB and maintaining its nuclear localization, consequently inhibiting nuclear transcription of MMP10 through the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Targeting MMP10 in situ in arterial isografts can effectively alleviate vascular calcification caused by conditional endothelial TRIM35 knockout. These findings demonstrated that TRIM35 inhibited vascular calcification during arterial isograft remodeling, a process that is driven by the aberrant secretion of endothelial MMP10. Targeting MMP10 pathway may be a potential therapeutic strategy for vascular calcification in vessel grafts.},

However, due to the undefined chemical structure, toxicity, non-biodegradability, and lack of design technology in many existing adjuvants, it remains difficult to achieve substantive breakthroughs in the adjuvant research field. Here, a novel adjuvant development strategy based on stapling peptides is reported to overcome this challenge. The nano-vaccine incorporating peptide adjuvant and recombinant HBsAg protein not only induced strong antibody titers that are equivalent to aluminum adjuvanted vaccines but also simultaneously activated T-cell immune response. Similar results are also observed in herpes zoster vaccine and more complex influenza vaccine. The mechanism analysis demonstrates that antigen is efficiently carried into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by peptide, further promoting the secretion of cytokines and activation of APCs. In addition, by redesigning the adjuvant, it is found that the sulfonium centers, rather than the sequence of peptide played an important role in immune activation. This discovery may provide a new paradigm for the rational design of peptide-based adjuvants. In brief, this study demonstrates that stapling peptides with sulfonium centers can provide a well-defined, programmable, biocompatible, and effective adjuvant for multiple types of vaccines.},

The protein SPARC is primarily involved in cell interaction and migration, but its specific role in the intestinal epithelial barrier remains unclear. This study demonstrates that SPARC is significantly overexpressed in both CD patients and murine models of colitis. Furthermore, mice deficient in SPARC exhibits resistance to chemically induced colitis, a phenomenon associated with the modulation of barrier-associated proteins. Mechanistically, it is elucidated that SPARC competitively binds to OTUD4 in conjunction with MYD88, facilitating the translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and subsequent activation of the p65-MLCK/MLC2 pathway, thereby compromising barrier integrity. Additionally, it is identified that the elevated expression of SPARC in CD is regulated via the METTL3-YTHDF1 axis. These findings indicate that SPARC levels are elevated in patients with CD and in colitis-induced mice, leading to intestinal barrier damage through direct interaction with OTUD4 and subsequent activation of the MYD88/p65/MLCK/MLC2 signaling pathway. Consequently, targeting SPARC or the OTUD4/MYD88/p65/MLCK/MLC2 axis may offer novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CD and represent a potential therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {Plants activate defense machinery when infested by herbivorous insects but avoid such costs in the absence of herbivory. However, the key signaling pathway regulators underlying such flexibility and the mechanisms that insects exploit these components to disarm plant defense systems remain elusive. Here, it is reported that immune repressor 14-3-3e in rice Oryza sativa (OsGF14e) regulates immune homeostasis. Infestation with brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens decreased OsGF14e expression; however, the level of downregulation is limited both by the short duration and the specific feeding location. OsGF14e interacts with Enhanced Disease Resistance 1-like (OsEDR1l), a Raf-like MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), and repressed jasmonic acid, jasmonic acid-isoleucine, and H 2 O 2 accumulation by enhancing OsEDR1l abundance and signaling ability. OsGF14e and OsEDR1l overexpression renders rice susceptible to BPH, whereas their knockout increases plant resistance but compromises rice growth and grain yield. Intriguingly, BPH 14-3-3e protein (Nl14) that shares high sequence homology and structural similarity with OsGF14e is identified from BPH saliva and egg-associated secretions. Mediated through BPH feeding and oviposition, Nl14, similar to OsGF14e, interacts with OsEDR1l and triggers the OsEDR1l signaling, thereby suppressing plant defenses and facilitating BPH infestation. Apparently, structural and functional mimicry makes it possible for this newly discovered BPH effector to exploit rice OsGF14e-EDR1l immune suppression module. The results reveal a novel mechanism deployed by herbivorous insects, in a manner similar to certain pathogen effectors, to evade host plant defenses by mimicking host immune regulators.},

This study presents a novel transfer learning model based on network target theory, integrating deep learning techniques with diverse biological molecular networks to predict drug-disease interactions. By incorporating network techniques that leverage vast existing knowledge, the approach enables the extraction of more precise and informative drug features, resulting in the identification of 88,161 drug-disease interactions involving 7,940 drugs and 2,986 diseases. Furthermore, this model effectively addresses the challenge of balancing large-scale positive and negative samples, leading to improved performance across various evaluation metrics such as an Area under curve (AUC) of 0.9298 and an F1 score of 0.6316. Moreover, the algorithm accurately predicts drug combinations and achieves an F1 score of 0.7746 after fine-tuning. Additionally, it identifies two previously unexplored synergistic drug combinations for distinct cancer types in disease-specific biological network environments. These findings are further validated through in vitro cytotoxicity assays, demonstrating the potential of the model to enhance drug development and identify effective treatment regimens for specific diseases.},

  abstract     = {MXenzymes, a promising class of catalytic therapeutic material, offer great potential for tumor treatment, but they encounter significant obstacles due to suboptimal catalytic efficiency and kinetics in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, this study draws inspiration from the electronic structure of transition metal vanadium, proposing the leverage of TME specific-features to induce structural transformations in sheet-like vanadium carbide MXenzymes (TVMz). These transformations trigger cascading catalytic reactions that amplify oxidative stress, thereby significantly enhancing multimodal tumor therapy. Specifically, the engineered HTVMz, coated with hyaluronic acid, exhibits good stability and generates a thermal effect under NIR-II laser irradiation. The thermal effect, combined with TME characteristics, facilities a structural transformation into ultra-small vanadium oxide nanozymes (VO x ). The enlarged surface area of VO x substantially enhances ROS regeneration and amplifies oxidative stress, which promotes lysosomal permeability and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. The high-valent vanadium in VO x interacts with intracellular glutathione, disrupting redox homeostasis and intensifying oxidative stress further. These amplifications accelerate tumor apoptosis, induce ferroptosis, and suppress HSP90 expression. Consequently, the heightened thermal sensitivity of HTVMz synergistically promotes tumor cell death via multimodal therapeutic pathways. This study presents an innovative strategy for tumor catalytic therapy by manipulating MXenzymes structures, advancing the field of catalytic therapy.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are commonly considered accomplices in tumorigenesis and tumor development. However, the precise mechanism by which tumor cells prompt TAMs to aid in evading immune surveillance remains to be further investigated. Here, it is elucidated that tumor-secreted galectin-1 (Gal1) conferred immunosuppressive properties to TAMs. Specifically, patient specimens and a public database is first used to analyze the clinical relevance of Gal1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Then, it is demonstrated that TAMs functioned as a critical mediator in the Gal1-induced progression of HCC and the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing determined that Gal1 promoted the upregulation of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) in TAMs via activating the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway. Employing an anti-CCL20 neutralizing antibody and Foxp3DTR mice, it is demonstrated that CCR6 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) recruited by Gal1-induced TAMs contributed to reduced infiltration and dysfunctional state of CD8 + T cells, subsequently facilitating tumor progression. Targeting Gal1 dampened the secretion of CCL20 and inhibits the recruitment of Tregs, thereby activating anti-tumor immunity and ameliorating anti-PD-1 resistance. Together, this findings revealed that Gal1-induced TAMs recruited Tregs through the CCL20-CCR6 axis. Inhibition of Gal1 improves the effectiveness of anti-PD1 therapy, shedding important new light on the combination immunotherapy of HCC.},

However, the properties of the hAECs and their proliferative mechanisms remain unclear. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is performed on hAECs obtained from amniotic tissues at different gestational ages and passages during in vitro culture. The results showed that the proliferation of hAECs is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) during amniogenesis. Freshly isolated, full-term hAECs are identified as mature epithelial cells. Once cultured in vitro, they are observed to rapidly undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enter a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) state to regain their EMP properties and proliferation capacities. With the continuous development of EMT, hAECs eventually enter a senescent state. The addition of SB431542 and microcarrier screening enabled the effective 3D expansion of hAECs by 50 fold while maintaining the EMP status in hAECs for further proliferation. This study not only elucidated the central proliferation mechanism of hAECs during development and expansion but also optimized the in vitro culture system so that it is sufficient to generate hAECs for 50 patients from a single donor amniotic membrane.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in obese patients remains challenging. Recent studies have linked obesity to an increased risk of TNBC and malignancies. Through multiomic analysis and experimental validation, a dysfunctional Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit H (EIF3H)/Yes-associated protein (YAP) proteolytic axis is identified as a pivotal junction mediating the interplay between cancer-associated adipocytes and the response to anti-cancer drugs in TNBC. Mechanistically, cancer-associated adipocytes drive metabolic reprogramming resulting in an upregulated hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This aberrant upregulation of HBP promotes YAP O-GlcNAcylation and the subsequent recruitment of EIF3H deubiquitinase, which stabilizes YAP, thus promoting tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance. It is found that Retatrutide, an anti-obesity agent, inhibits HBP and YAP O-GlcNAcylation leading to increased YAP degradation through the deprivation of EIF3H-mediated deubiquitylation of YAP. In preclinical models of obese TNBC, Retatrutide downregulates HBP, decreases YAP protein levels, and consequently decreases tumor size and enhances chemotherapy efficacy. This effect is particularly pronounced in obese mice bearing TNBC tumors. Overall, these findings reveal a critical interplay between adipocyte-mediated metabolic reprogramming and EIF3H-mediated YAP proteolytic control, offering promising therapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of obesity on TNBC progression.},

  abstract     = {Intranasal delivery of mRNA vaccines offers promising opportunities to combat airborne viruses like SARS-CoV-2 by provoking mucosal immunity, which not only defends against respiratory infection but also prevents contagious transmission. However, the development of nasal mRNA vaccines has been hampered by the lack of effective means to overcome the mucus barrier. Herein, ionizable lipid-incorporated liquid lipid nanoparticles (iLLNs) capable of delivering mRNA cargo across airway mucosa are designed. Adjusting the ratios of ionizable and cationic lipids allows fine-tuning of the p K a of iLLNs to the range of nasal mucosal pH (5.5–6.5), thus facilitating mucus penetration via the formation of near-neutral, PEGylated muco-inert surfaces. When nasally administered to mice, the top candidate iLLN-2/mRNA complexes enable about 60-fold greater reporter gene expression in the nasal cavity, compared to the benchmark mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (ALC-LNP) having the same lipid composition as that of BNT162b2 vaccine. Moreover, a prime-boost intranasal immunization of iLLN-2/mRNA complexes elicits a greater magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific mucosal IgA and IgG response than ALC-LNP, without triggering any noticeable inflammatory reactions. Taken together, these results provide useful insights for the design of nasally deliverable mRNA formulations for prophylactic applications.},

  abstract     = {Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with well-established metabolic risk factors, especially hyperlipidemia and obesity. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (mIRI) significantly offsets the therapeutic efficacy of revascularization. Previous studies indicated that disrupted lipid homeostasis can lead to lipid peroxidation damage and inflammation, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, the study demonstrates that hyperlipidemia is a key driver of mIRI. Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) is upregulated in both hyperlipidemia and AMI patients. ACSL1 expression is induced by a high-fat microenvironment (oxLDL and palmitic acid) in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, the protein level is positively correlated with total cholesterol level and thromboinflammatory biomarkers. Furthermore, ACSL1 reprogrammed lipid metabolism in monocytes, leading to the accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)/lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). The monocytic LPC/LPA axis accelerated lipid peroxidation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)-induced thromboinflammation via the paracrine effect. The main LPA producer Autotaxinis is also induced under high-fat conditions and then exerts thromboinflammation response through converted LPC to LPA. Finally, ACSL1 knockdown or NETs release inhibitor (DNase I or GSK484) significantly alleviated mIRI in mice. These findings highlight ACSL1 and NETosis as potential key targets for preventing mIRI and underscore the lipid peroxidation in the mechanisms of ACSL1-mediated thromboinflammation.},

Strengthening the pelvic floor with bioactive tissue-engineered meshes is an emerging concept. This study investigates tissue regenerative design parameters, including degradability, porosity, and angulation, to develop alternative degradable melt electrowritten (MEW) constructs for surgical applications of POP. MEW constructs were fabricated in hierarchical geometries by two-way stacking of the fibers with three different inter layer angles of 90°, 45°, or 22.5°. Implants printed at 22.5° have higher tensile strength under dry conditions and show better vaginal fibroblast (VF) attachment in vitro. In vivo assessment using preclinical mouse and ovine models demonstrates more effective degradation and improved tissue integration in 22.5° angular meshes compared to 90° and 45° meshes, with evidence of neo-collagen deposition within implants at 6 weeks. The pattern and geometry of the layered MEW implants also influence the foreign body response, wherein the anti-inflammatory phenotype shows a greater ratio of anti-inflammatory CD206+ M2 macrophages/pro-inflammatory CCR7+ M1 macrophages.

  abstract     = {Aspartate (Asp) metabolism-mediated antioxidant functions have important implications for neonatal growth and intestinal health; however, the antioxidant mechanisms through which Asp regulates the gut microbiota and influences RIP activation remain elusive. This study reports that chronic oxidative stress disrupts gut microbiota and metabolite balance and that such imbalance is intricately tied to the perturbation of Asp metabolism. Under normal conditions, in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that exogenous Asp improves intestinal health by regulating epithelial cell proliferation, nutrient uptake, and apoptosis. During oxidative stress, Asp reduces Megasphaera abundance while increasing Ruminococcaceae . This reversal effect depends on the enhanced production of the antioxidant eicosapentaenoic acid mediated through Asp metabolism and microbiota. Mechanistically, the application of exogenous Asp orchestrates the antioxidant responses in enterocytes via the modulation of the RIP3-MLKL and RIP1-Nrf2-NF-κB pathways to eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species and maintain mitochondrial functionality and cellular survival. These results demonstrate that Asp signaling alleviates oxidative stress by dynamically modulating the gut microbiota and RIP-dependent mitochondrial function, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for oxidative stress disease treatment.},
