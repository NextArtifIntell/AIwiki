  abstract     = {Company earnings calls are pivotal events that offer crucial insights into a company&#39;s financial well-being and future outlook. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising avenue for automatically generating the initial draft of earnings call scripts, leveraging financial data and past examples. We evaluate two distinct methods: (1) few-shot learning prompt engineering with a large language model (LLM) and (2) fine-tuning a large language model on earnings call transcript data. Our findings indicate that both methods can produce coherent scripts encompassing key metrics, updates, and guidance. However, there are inherent trade-offs in comprehensiveness, potential hallucinations, writing style, ease of use, and cost. We discuss the pros and cons of each method to guide practitioners on effectively harnessing LLMs for earnings call script generation. Notably, we employ a human and two different LLMs to act as judges to compare the outcomes generated by the two approaches.},

  abstract     = {Modern large language models (LLMs) represent a paradigm shift in what can plausibly be expected of machine learning models. The fact that LLMs can effectively generate sensible answers to a diverse range of queries suggests that they would be useful in customer support applications. While powerful, LLMs have been observed to be prone to hallucination which unfortunately makes their near-term use in customer support applications challenging. To address this issue, we present a system that allows us to use an LLM to augment our customer support advocates by re-framing the language modeling task as a discriminative classification task. In this framing, we seek to present the Top-K best template responses for a customer support advocate to use when responding to a customer. We present the result of both offline and online experiments where we observed offline gains and statistically significant online lifts for our experimental system. Along the way, we present observed scaling curves for validation loss and Top-K accuracy, resulted from model parameter ablation studies. We close by discussing the space of trade-offs with respect to model size, latency, and accuracy as well as and suggesting future applications to explore.},

  abstract     = {Biological function often depends on complex mechanisms of a dynamic, time-variant nature. An example is certain bat species (horseshoe bats—Rhinolophidae) that use intricate pinna musculatures to execute a variety of pinna deformations. While prior work has indicated the potential significance of these motions for sensory information encoding, it remains unclear how the complex time-variant pinna geometries could be controlled to enhance sensory performance. To address this issue, this work has investigated deep neural network models as digital twins for biomimetic pinnae. The networks were trained to predict the acoustic impacts of the deformed pinna geometries. A total of three network architectures have been evaluated for this purpose using physical numerical simulations (boundary element method) as ground truth. The networks predicted the acoustic beampattern function from pinna shape or even directly from the states of actuators that were used to deform the pinna shapes in simulation. Inserting prior knowledge in the form of beam-shaped basis functions did not improve network performance. The ability of the networks to produce beampattern predictions with low computational effort (in about three milliseconds each) should lend itself readily to supporting learning methods such as deep reinforcement learning that require many such functional evaluations.},

Consequently, urban decision-makers prioritize the mitigation of congestion. This study delves into the efficacy of harnessing extensive data on urban traffic dynamics, coupled with comprehensive knowledge of road networks, to enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in forecasting traffic flux well in advance. Such forecasts hold promise for informing emission reduction measures, particularly those aligned with Low Emission Zone policies. The investigation centers on Valencia, leveraging its robust traffic sensor infrastructure, one of the most densely deployed worldwide, encompassing approximately 3500 sensors strategically positioned across the city. Employing historical data spanning 2016 and 2017, we undertake the task of training and characterizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network for the prediction of temporal traffic patterns. Our findings demonstrate the LSTM&#39;s efficacy in real-time forecasting of traffic flow evolution, facilitated by its ability to discern salient patterns within the dataset.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new approach to indoor positioning that utilises channel state information (CSI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to improve accuracy. The proposed method extracts the amplitude and phase differences of the subcarriers from the CSI data to create fingerprints. ML algorithms and network architecture are utilised to train the CSI data from two antennas, in the form of phase and amplitude. Experiments conducted in a standard indoor environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The ANN model with two hidden layers was trained with experimental data collected from subjects (canines and felines) in our previous work. Inverse mapping of the trained ANNs was conducted using BO to predict the acceptable MV settings for specific subject outcomes. Our results suggest that the model can support veterinarians in estimating the proper MV parameters for optimal subject outcome.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment classification deals with extracting and classifying the text sentiment. Fuzzy Deep Belief Network (DBN) has proved its efficiency in dealing with sentiment analysis and suitability for classifying unlabeled or semi-labeled data. Previous structures of deep belief networks are mostly made of traditional activation functions such as sigmoid. In this paper, a new activation function, which is referred to as hyperbolic secant function, is proposed. The new activation function not only solves gradient zeroing problem but also increases the accuracy and efficiency. Besides, extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed as the decision layer to increase the accuracy and improve the generalizability through solving gradient-based learning problem. The efficiency of the proposed method has been experimented on “IMDB” movie critic dataset, 20-newspaper dataset and Sentiment Analysis dataset. The results of the proposed method are more accurate and precise as compared with the previous approaches.},
