  abstract     = {Ladderenes, unique polymers composed of fused cyclobutane rings, exhibit promising properties for energy storage applications, including reversible redox behavior and structural tunability. This density functional theory (DFT) study investigates the formation of ladderenes via gold(I)-catalyzed alkyne-alkene coupling reactions. Our calculations reveal a step-wise chain propagation mechanism where the alkene product of each step reacts with a ligand-gold-alkyne complex, leading to the sequential addition of cyclobutene units. We demonstrate that electron-withdrawing substituents on the alkynes, such as chlorine, facilitate the dissociation of the gold catalyst (PMe 3 Au + ) from the cyclobutene adduct, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Solvent effects are also shown to significantly influence the reaction energetics. This finding highlights the significant impact of alkyne substitution on the catalytic cycle. The inherent exothermicity of ladderene formation, coupled with their unique structural features, suggests their potential for storing energy in the form of “covalently condensed acetylene”.},

  abstract     = {In photopharmacology, molecular photoswitches enable light-controlled drug activities, offering precision in targeting biomolecular functions while minimizing side effects. Photostatins (PSTs) are photoswitchable analogs of combretastatin A-4 (CA4), designed to inhibit tubulin polymerization for cancer treatment. However, the influence of substituents and molecular environments on their photochemistry remains unclear. In this work, the cis -to- trans photodynamics of five PSTs (PST1 to PST5) in the vacuum and aqueous solution were simulated using the ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS) coupled with correlated multireference electronic structure calculations. Four distinct minima in the same conical intersection seam were discovered, serving as nonradiative decay channels. The aqueous environment slows photoisomerization and lowers its quantum yields and changes the structures near the conical intersection seam. Substituent position and electronegativity significantly impact the isomerization kinetics by altering energy gaps between MECIs and the S 1 state at the Franck-Condon region. These findings provide useful insights into designing next-generation phototherapeutics for cancer.},

Throughout, we emphasize the maintenance/creation of 3D coordinates and better interoperability. The latter is achieved by stable embedding of meta-information into output files and by improving the mutual compatibility of molecular representations (e.g., aromaticity perception). ParaLig wraps around core functionalities provided by a variety of existing software: the two popular cheminformatics packages OpenBabel and RDKit, and the general force field providers CGenFF and AmberTools. Our workflows emphasize scalable bulk processing of large libraries of molecules, and we provide an MPI-based wrapper to simplify deployment to high-performance computing resources. Along with salient descriptions of the methods, we benchmark performance both in terms of throughput and in terms of the quality of some of the results.},

  abstract     = {Protein structural fluctuations, measured by Debye-Waller factors or B-factors, are known to be closely associated with protein flexibility and function. Theoretical approaches have also been developed to predict B-factor values, which reflect protein flexibility. Previous models have made significant strides in analyzing B-factors by fitting experimental data. In this study, we propose a novel approach for B-factor prediction using differential geometry theory, based on the assumption that the intrinsic properties of proteins reside on a family of low-dimensional manifolds embedded within the high-dimensional space of protein structures. By analyzing the mean and Gaussian curvatures of a set of low-dimensional manifolds defined by kernel functions, we develop effective and robust multiscale differential geometry (mDG) models. Our mDG model demonstrates a 27% increase in accuracy compared to the classical Gaussian network model (GNM) in predicting B-factors for a dataset of 364 proteins. Additionally, by incorporating both global and local protein features, we construct a highly effective machine-learning model for the blind prediction of B-factors. Extensive least-squares approximations and machine learning-based blind predictions validate the effectiveness of the mDG modeling approach for B-factor predictions.},

We have first deduced the missing interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system within the SPICA/SDK CG force-field (CG-FF). By monitoring the electron density profiles, the orientational order parameter, and reproducing the all-atom MD-derived free energy for the insertion of ethanol from the bulk aqueous phase to the hydrophobic core of the POPC-CHOL lipid bilayer, we successfully determined all the missing non-bonding interaction parameters for the POPC-CHOL-EtOH-water system. The proposed force field was applied to investigate the effect of ethanol at various concentrations on unilamellar vesicles composed of POPC and cholesterol. It was found that 40 mol% or more concentration of ethanol is required to disintegrate or rupture the POPC-CHOL vesicle membranes. While cholesterol offers some resilience against the detrimental effects of ethanol, we still observe an increase in vesicle size (swelling) and a contraction in the bilayer thickness (thinning) as ethanol concentration rises from 0 to 30 mol%. At ethanol concentrations exceeding 30 mol%, the vesicles become increasingly susceptible to disintegration due to enhanced penetration of ethanol and water molecules into the hydrophobic core of the membranes.},

  abstract     = {A computational study of I-BODIPY (2-ethyl-4,4-difluoro-6,7-diiodo-1,3-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) has been carried out to investigate its key photophysical properties as a potential triplet photosensitizer capable of generating singlet oxygen. Multireference CASPT2 and CASSCF methods have been used to calculate vertical excitation energies and spin–orbit couplings (SOCs), respectively, in a model (mono-iodinated BODIPY) molecule to assess the applicability of the single-reference second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction, ADC(2), method to this and similar molecules. Subsequently, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), possibly within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA), using several exchange-correlation functionals has been tested on I-BODIPY against ADC(2), both employing a basis set with a two-component pseudopotential on the iodine atoms. Finally, the magnitudes of SOC between excited electronic states of all types found have thoroughly been discussed using the Slater–Condon rules applied to an arbitrary one-electron one-center effective spin–orbit Hamiltonian. The geometry dependence of SOCs between the lowest-lying states has also been addressed. Based on these investigations, the TD-DFT/B3LYP and TD-DFT(TDA)/BHLYP approaches have been selected as the methods of choice for the subsequent nuclear ensemble approach absorption spectra simulations and mixed quantum-classical trajectory surface hopping (TSH) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, respectively. Two bright states in the visible spectrum of I-BODIPY have been found, exhibiting a redshift of the main peak with respect to unsubstituted BODIPY caused by the iodine substituents. Excited-state MD simulations including both non-adiabatic effects and SOCs have been performed to investigate the relaxation processes in I-BODIPY after its photoexcitation to the state. The TSH MD simulations revealed that intersystem crossings occur on a time scale comparable to internal conversions and that after an initial phase of triplet population growth a “saturation” is reached where the ratio of the net triplet to singlet populations is about 4:1. The calculated triplet quantum yield of 0.85 is in qualitative agreement with the previously reported experimental singlet oxygen generation yield of 0.99 0.06.},
