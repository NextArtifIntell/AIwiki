Differential membrane contractions between cells significantly influence segregation.

The interface decay exponent is close to λ ∼ 1 / 3 , differing from previous cluster fusion and diffusion model predictions.},

Selecting an interaction potential for which a LLPT occurs in the bulk liquid, we conduct simulations of supercooled water nanodroplets having between 1000 and 80000 molecules. We show that as the droplet size decreases, the Laplace pressure grows large enough to drive the droplets through the transition from the low-density to the high-density liquid phase, and that all droplets in this size range are large enough to have cores exhibiting the structure and properties of bulk water. To guide experiments, we estimate the range of values for the critical pressure of the LLPT in real water that can be observed using nanodroplets, and propose structural and dynamical measures by which the LLPT in nanodroplets can be detected.},

In our work, we investigate the relationship between higher-order mechanisms and higher-order behavioral observables in two representative models with group interactions: a simplicial Ising model and a social contagion model. In both systems, we find that group (higher-order) interactions show emergent synergistic (higher-order) behavior. The emergent synergy appears only at the group level and depends in a complex, nonlinear way on the trade-off between the strengths of the low- and higher-order mechanisms and is invisible to low-order behavioral observables. Our work sets the basis for systematically investigating the relation between causal mechanisms and behavioral patterns in complex networked systems with group interactions, offering a robust methodological framework to tackle this challenging task.},

  abstract     = {The synergistic control of light’s frequency and orbital angular momentum (OAM) via integrated nonlinear ring microresonators is crucial for creating spatiotemporal optical waveforms and advancing optical metrology. A direct analog of this capability in acoustics is challenging due to the nonlinearity-based mechanisms’ dependence on external driving and limited frequency conversion efficiency. Here, we present an acoustic synthesized comb structure derived from spatiotemporal metasurfaces, concurrently controlling frequency and OAM characteristics with high conversion efficiency and removing the constraints of critical driving frequency and power level in nonlinear mechanisms. By optimizing comb structures, energy distributions among OAM modes are adjusted to different frequency lines. We finally propose spatiotemporal metalens devices based on vortex-frequency combs, enabling synchronously multiple-order spatial differential operations for parallel data processing. This Letter is groundbreaking in integrating spectral- and spatial-domain acoustic waves, promising multifunctional imaging and advantages in spatiotemporal beams.},

  abstract     = {Using first-principles electronic structure calculation, we demonstrate the spin dissipation process in bulk Fe by orbital excitations within the energy bands of pure spin character. The variation of orbitals in the intraband transitions provides an efficient channel to convert spin to orbital angular momentum with spin-orbit interaction. This mechanism dominates the Gilbert damping of Fe below room temperature. The theoretical prediction is confirmed by the ferromagnetic resonance experiment performed on single-crystal Fe(001) films. A significant thickness-dependent damping oscillation is found at low temperature induced by the quantum well states of the corresponding energy bands. Our findings not only explain the microscopic nature of the recently reported ultralow damping of Fe-based alloys but also help for the understanding of the transport and dissipation process of orbital currents.},

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band’s natural tendency toward static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The recent observation of high- T c superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La 3 Ni 2 O 7 under pressure has garnered significant interest. While researches have predominantly focused on the role of electron-electron interactions in the superconducting mechanism, the impact of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) has remained elusive and unexplored. In this Letter, we perform first-principles calculations to study the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling within La 3 Ni 2 O 7 under pressure and explore the interplay between EPC and electronic interactions on the superconductivity by employing functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. Our calculations reveal that EPC alone is insufficient to trigger superconductivity in La 3 Ni 2 O 7 under pressure. We identify unique out-of-plane and in-plane breathing phonon modes which selectively couple with the Ni d z 2 and d x 2 − y 2 orbitals, showcasing an orbital-selective EPC. Within the bilayer two-orbital model, it is revealed that solely electronic interactions foster s ± -wave pairing characterized by notable frustration in the band space, leading to a relatively low transition temperature. Remarkably, we find that the out-of-plane EPC can act in concert with electronic interactions to promote the interlayer pairing in the d z 2 orbital, partially releasing the pairing frustration and thus elevating T c . In contrast, the inclusion of in-plane EPC only marginally affects the superconductivity, distinct from the cuprates. Potential experimental implications in La 3 Ni 2 O 7 are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors the chiral A phase of the superfluid He 3 over the time-reversal invariant B phase. Confining the superfluid He 3 into a cavity of height D of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length ξ 0 —ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar)—extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures P and temperatures T where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this Letter, the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid He 4 film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full P − T phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit D / ξ 0 = 1 , where D = 80 nm . The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully gapped two-dimensional p x + i p y superfluid under more extreme confinement.},

  abstract     = {The standard magnetorotational instability (SMRI) with a magnetic field component parallel to the rotation axis is widely believed to be responsible for the fast accretion in astronomical disks. In conventional base flows with a Keplerian profile or an ideal Couette profile, most studies focus on axisymmetric SMRI, since excitation of nonaxisymmetric SMRI in such flows requires a magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) more than an order of magnitude larger. Here, we report that, in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow, nonaxisymmetric SMRI with an azimuthal mode number m = 1 can be triggered by a free-shear layer in the base flow at Rm ≳ 1 , the same threshold as for axisymmetric SMRI. Global linear analysis reveals that the free-shear layer reduces the required Rm, possibly by introducing an extremum in the vorticity of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations validate the results from linear analysis and confirm that a novel instability recently discovered experimentally [Wang et al. , Nat. Commun. 13 , 4679 (2022) ] is the nonaxisymmetric m = 1 SMRI. Our finding has astronomical implications as free-shear layers are ubiquitous in celestial systems, such as the disk-star boundary layer, the solar tachocline, and the edge of planet-opened gaps in protoplanetary disks.},

The coupling between the atoms and the cavity field is induced by a transverse pump beam. Taking fluctuations around the mean-field solutions into account, we find that a transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths two self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a bistability. We show that the bistable behavior is induced by the atoms-cavity fluctuations and is not captured by the mean-field approach.},

Thanks to their tunable-range interactions, they are promising building blocks for quantum simulators. Here, we study the dynamics of an atom-photon bound state emerging from coupling a frequency-tunable quantum emitter—a transmon-type superconducting circuit—to the band edge of a microwave metamaterial. Employing precise temporal control over the frequency detuning of the emitter from the band edge, we examine the transition from adiabatic to nonadiabatic behavior in the formation of the bound state and its melting into the propagating modes of the metamaterial. Moreover, we experimentally observe multimode emission from the bound state, triggered by a fast change of the emitter’s frequency. Our Letter offers insight into the dynamic preparation of APBS and provides a method to characterize their photonic content, with implications in quantum optics and quantum simulation.},

  abstract     = {Rydberg dressing is a powerful tool for entanglement generation in long-lived atomic states. While already employed effectively in several demonstrations, a key challenge for this technique is the collective loss triggered by blackbody-radiation-driven transitions to contaminant Rydberg states of opposite parity. We demonstrate the rapid removal of such contaminants using autoionization (AI) transitions found in alkaline-earth-like atoms. The AI is shown to be compatible with coherent operation of an array of optical clock qubits. By incorporating AI pulses into a stroboscopic Rydberg dressing (SRD) sequence, we enhance lifetimes by an order of magnitude for system sizes of up to 144 atoms, while maintaining an order of magnitude larger duty cycle than previously achieved. To highlight the utility of our approach, we use the AI-enhanced SRD protocol to improve the degree of achieved spin-squeezing during early time dressing dynamics. These results bring Rydberg dressing lifetimes closer to fundamental limits, opening the door to previously infeasible dressing proposals.},

This also provides important constraints on the as-yet elusive all- N form of the rational part. Via Mellin transformation, we thus obtain the exact functional form in x of the respective piece of the nonsinglet Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi splitting function at four loops. This allows us to appreciably reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the approximation of that splitting function otherwise amenable from the first few low- N moments.},

However, EPR spectroscopy using NV ensembles is less efficient due to inhomogeneities in both sensors and targets. Spectral line broadening induced by ensemble averaging is even detrimental to spectroscopy. Here we show a kind of cross-relaxation EPR spectroscopy at zero field, where the sensor is tuned by an amplitude-modulated control field to match the target. The modulation makes detection robust to the sensors inhomogeneity, while zero-field EPR is naturally robust to the targets inhomogeneity. We demonstrate an efficient EPR measurement on an ensemble of ∼ 30 000 NV centers.

In this Letter, we introduce a family of multiplayer quantum games for which topologically ordered phases of matter are a resource yielding quantum advantage. Unlike previous examples, quantum advantage persists away from the exactly solvable point and is robust to arbitrary local perturbations, irrespective of system size. We demonstrate this robustness experimentally on Quantinuum’s H1-1 quantum computer by playing the game with a continuous family of randomly deformed toric code states that can be created with constant-depth circuits leveraging midcircuit measurements and unitary feedback. We are thus able to tune through a topological phase transition—witnessed by the loss of robust quantum advantage—on currently available quantum hardware. This behavior is contrasted with an analogous family of deformed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, for which arbitrarily weak local perturbations destroy quantum advantage in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we discuss a topological interpretation of the game, which leads to a natural generalization involving an arbitrary number of players.},

In the extensive regime, where the energy E scales as N and the fluctuations Δ E / E → 0 , our dissipative charging protocol yields a power proportional to N 2 , a scaling that cannot be achieved in this regime by Hamiltonian protocols. The trade-off for this enhanced charging power is a relative inefficiency since a large fraction of the incoming energy is lost through spontaneous emission to the environment. Nevertheless, we find that the system can store a large amount of coherence and release the stored energy coherently through spontaneous emission, again with a power scaling as N 2 .},
