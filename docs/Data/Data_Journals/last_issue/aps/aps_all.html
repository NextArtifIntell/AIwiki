  abstract     = {When cell sheets fold during development, their apical or basal surfaces constrict and cell shapes approach the geometric singularity in which these surfaces vanish. Here, we reveal the mechanical consequences of this geometric singularity for tissue folding in a minimal vertex model of an epithelial monolayer. In simulations of the buckling of the epithelium under compression and numerical solutions of the corresponding continuum model, we discover an “unbuckling” bifurcation: at large compression, the buckling amplitude can decrease with increasing compression. By asymptotic solution of the continuum equations, we reveal that this bifurcation comes with a large stiffening of the epithelium. Our results thus provide the mechanical basis for absorption of compressive stresses by tissue folds such as the cephalic furrow during germband extension in Drosophila .},

  abstract     = {Protracted equilibration times and a multitude of competing periodically modulated structures are common characteristics of complex, self-assembled phases in block copolymer materials. These characteristics highlight the importance of designing processes to reproducibly direct the structure evolution of complex, spatially modulated structures. Using general symmetry considerations, we design a process that deterministically transforms the common, double-gyroid (DG) phase of linear diblock copolymers into a metastable A15 structure by irreversibly switching a conformationally symmetric A B B ′ diblock copolymer into an A B A ′ triblock copolymer. Key to the fabrication of the Frank-Kasper A15 structure is the nonmonotonic time evolution of the segregation that allows us to partition the large unit cell of the DG phase into 8 equivalent A15 units. Comparison between dynamic self-consistent field theory and particle-based simulations demonstrates the robustness of the designed pathway against thermal fluctuations and memory effects due to the underlying Rouse dynamics. Metastable structures that can be accessed from the DG phase are systematically explored as a function of molecular asymmetry and incompatibility.},

Here, we combine small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and optical experiments with simulations to investigate the phase behavior of charged rodlike colloids across a wide range of salt concentrations and packing fractions. At ultralow ionic strength and packing fractions, we reveal both experimentally and numerically a direct transition from a nematic to a crystalline smectic-B phase, previously identified as a glass state. This transition, bypassing the smectic-A intermediate phase, results from minimizing Coulomb repulsion and maximizing entropic gains due to fluctuations in the crystalline structure. This demonstrates how long-range electrostatic repulsion significantly alters the phase behavior of rod-shaped particles and highlights its key role in driving the self-organization of anisotropic particles.},

These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform nonreciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the critical behavior of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a nonreciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its phase transitions by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered, and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spin types is broken, triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects but stabilized in three dimensions, where nonreciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.},

We also report an exact formula for the probability that there are two disjoint paths of the same color crossing an annulus. The backbone exponent captures the leading asymptotic, while the other roots of the elementary equation capture the asymptotic of the remaining terms. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Our approach is based on the coupling between Schramm-Loewner evolution curves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), and the integrability of Liouville CFT that governs the LQG surfaces.},

Using inelastic neutron scattering, we discover quasi-one-dimensional magnetic excitations in CeSb 2 emerging from nearly square Ce layers with minor orthorhombic deformation. We show that the data are well described by a ferromagnetic spin ladder model, where the “rungs” of the ladder straddle Ce bilayers. Moreover, we find that diffuse excitations akin to those in the ordered phase persist well above T N , suggesting that quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnetic paramagnons may significantly contribute to the unusual superconductivity that appears under pressure once magnetic order is suppressed.},

However, fully compensated ferrimagnetism, which exhibits band spin splitting but zero net magnetization, has yet to receive enough attention. Since the experimental preparation of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials in 2017, 2D magnetic materials, thanks to their super tunability, have quickly become an important playground for spintronics. Here, we extend the concept of fully compensated ferrimagnetism (fFIM) to two dimensions and propose 2D filling-enforced fFIM, demonstrate its stability and ease of manipulation, and present three feasible realization schemes with respective exemplary candidate materials. A simple model for 2D fully compensated ferrimagnets (fFIMs) is developed. Further investigation of 2D fFIMs’ physical properties reveals that they not only exhibit significant magneto-optical response but also show fully spin-polarized currents and the anomalous Hall effect in the half-metallic states, displaying characteristics previously almost exclusive to ferromagnetic materials, greatly broadening the research and application prospects of spintronic materials.},

Combined with the confined electrons and distinct lattice dynamics of two-dimensional (2D) materials, exploring UMA, especially its temperature dependence in 2D ferromagnets, is significant. Here, we report an unprecedented exotic behavior of temperature dependence of UMA in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnet . Below 20 K, the temperature-dependent UMA constant exhibits a canonical Akulov-Zener-Callen-Callen-type with rapidly decreasing trend. Strikingly, above 20 K, it transitions to an anomalous Carr-type one with rapidly increasing trend. Temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction measurements combined with first-principles calculations reveal that the enhanced ferromagnetic exchange coupling caused by the lattice variation preserves the two-ion anisotropy at high temperature. Therein, both the itinerant nature and lattice thermal expansion are altered, thus triggering such exotic . Our findings not only deepen the basic understanding of the temperature dependence of UMA but also favor optimizing the ultra-high-density heat-assisted magnetic recording technology by considering the cooperation between lattice and ferromagnetic exchange coupling.},

This effect opens a promising possibility for imaging of the domain structure in the magnetically compensated structures. We consider a thin film of a -wave altermagnet bent in a stretching-free manner and demonstrate that gradients of the film curvature induce a local magnetization that is approximately tangential to the film. The magnetization amplitude directly reflects the altermagnetic symmetry and depends on the direction of bending. It is maximal for the bending along directions of the maximal altermagnetic splitting of the magnon bands. A periodically bent film of sinusoidal shape possesses a total magnetic moment per period , where and are the bending amplitude and wave vector, respectively. The total magnetic moment is perpendicular to the plane of the unbent film and its direction (up or down) is determined by the bending direction. A film roll-up to a nanotube possesses a toroidal moment directed along the tube per one coil, where and are the coil radius and the pitch between coils.

This mode emerges from the hybridization of the homogeneous Dirac point mode and in-gap topological corner modes. Remarkably, this hybridized mode possesses unique chirality related to the chiral symmetry. We experimentally observe such hybridized mode in a two-dimensional (2D) photonic system and demonstrate its robustness by introducing disorders in the structure. Our findings advance the frontier of higher-order topology research, transitioning it from single-lattice systems to hybridized multilattice systems.

  abstract     = {Topological phases of matter provide a flexible platform to engineer unconventional quantum excitations in quantum materials. Beyond single particle topological matter, in systems with strong quantum many-body correlations, many-body effects can be the driving force for non-trivial topology. Here, we propose a one-dimensional engineered Kondo lattice where the emergence of topological excitations is driven by collective many-body Kondo physics. We first show the existence of topological zero modes in this system by solving the interacting model with tensor networks, and demonstrate their robustness against disorder. To unveil the origin of the topological zero modes, we analyze the associated periodic Anderson model showing that it can be mapped to a topological non-Hermitian model, enabling rationalizing the origin of the topological zero modes. We finally show that the topological invariant of the many-body Kondo lattice can be computed with a correlation matrix pumping method directly with the exact quantum many-body wave function. Our results provide a strategy to engineer topological Kondo insulators, highlighting quantum magnetism as a driving force in engineering topological matter.},

  abstract     = {Landau levels play a fundamental role in condensed matter physics, as they offer critical insights into charged particles’ behavior in magnetic fields. These unique characteristics have significant implications for understanding various quantum phenomena and materials’ electronic properties, such as the renowned quantum Hall effect. Over the past two decades, substantial advancements have been achieved in Landau levels in systems with linear band crossing points, like Weyl points, which exhibit fascinating features like chiral zero modes. The Landau levels observed thus far are independent of the magnetic field’s orientation. In this Letter, we experimentally demonstrate unconventional oriented Landau levels in acoustic Berry dipole systems, wherein by reversing the orientation of the pseudomagnetic field, the system exhibits distinct Landau spectra. Remarkably, we observe a new type of helical zero mode, whose existence critically depends on the magnetic field’s orientation. This is in sharp contrast to the well-studied chiral zero modes in Weyl systems, whose propagation direction, but not existence, depends on the applied magnetic field’s orientation. Our Letter opens up avenues for understanding the interaction of gauge fields with band singularities that go beyond Chern class, including Berry multipoles and even-dimensional monopoles, and offers new insights for exploring topological devices.},

In particular, they are naturally well suited to realizing higher-dimensional, stable, and intrinsically gapless SPTs through the combination of canonical topological insulator and semimetal models with critical gapless models in symmetry-protected tensor product constructions, opening avenues to far broader and deeper investigation of topology via short-range entanglement.},

Recently, their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, i.e., dispersionless 3D LLs with well-defined quantum numbers, have attracted significant attention but have not yet been reported. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally observe 3D LLs with a sharply quantized spectrum in a diamond acoustic lattice, where the eigenstates are characterized by SU(3) quantum numbers. The engineered inhomogeneous hopping strengths not only introduce pseudomagnetic fields that quantize the nodal lines into LLs but also provide three bosonic degrees of freedom, embedding a generic SU(3) symmetry into the LLs. Using a phased array of acoustic sources, we selectively excite distinct eigenstates within the degenerate LL multiplets and visualize their 3D eigenmodes. Importantly, our approach enables the precise reconstruction of SU(3) quantum numbers directly from eigenmode correlations. Our results establish SU(3) LLs as a tractable model in artificial platforms, and pave the way for synthesizing LLs with zero dispersion and countable quantum numbers in arbitrary dimensions.},

  abstract     = {The tunability of Dirac semimetals with antiferromagnetic Mn layers is of great interest. The observed sign change of interlayer magnetic coupling between CaMnBi 2 and SrMnBi 2 suggests ionic substitution as a potential tuning mechanism. If so, novel behavior near the compensation point could be expected. To explore this, we study a mixed-cation analog, Ca 0.6 Sr 0.4 MnSb 2 , where Bi is replaced by Sb. Conventional inelastic neutron scattering is impractical due to the small crystal size ( m ≈ 0.28 g ) available for compositional studies; however, we find that using a neutron diffractometer with a wide-angle area detector we can obtain a good quality spin-wave signal, which is shaped by energy-momentum conservation and retains spectroscopic information even without direct energy analysis. Spin-wave modeling reveals an interlayer coupling quantitatively similar to SrMnSb 2 , indicating it is not directly tuned by ionic size and that the sign change in Bi-based compounds likely arises from the observed change in lattice symmetry. Beyond this key insight, our results present an efficient method for parametric and compositional studies of spin dynamics in small crystals.},

Here we show that the infinite-dimensional limit of a quantum lattice model, as described by dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provides a natural framework to understand this self-consistent thermalization process. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model as a working example, we demonstrate that the emergence of a self-consistent bath occurs via a sharp thermalization front, moving ballistically and separating the initial condition from the long time thermal fixed point. We characterize the full DMFT dynamics through an effective temperature for which we derive a traveling wave equation of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov type. This equation allows for predicting the asymptotic shape of the front and its velocity, which match perfectly the full DMFT numerics.

  abstract     = {The two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to capture key ingredients of high- T c superconductivity in cuprate materials. However, compelling evidence remains elusive. In particular, various magnetic orders may emerge as strong competitors of superconducting orders. Here, we study the ground state properties of the doped two-dimensional t − t ′ Hubbard model on a square lattice via the infinite projected entangled-pair state method with U(1) or SU(2) spin symmetry. The former is compatible with antiferromagnetic orders, while the latter forbids them. Therefore, we obtain by comparison a detailed understanding of the magnetic impact on superconductivity. Moreover, an additional t ′ term accommodates the particle-hole asymmetry, which facilitates studies on the discrepancies between electron- and hole-doped systems. We demonstrate that (i) a positive t ′ / t significantly amplifies the strength of superconducting orders; (ii) at sufficiently large doping levels, the t − t ′ Hubbard model favors a uniform state with superconducting orders instead of stripe states with charge and spin modulations; and (iii) the enhancement of magnetic frustration, by increasing either the strength of next-nearest neighbor interactions or the charge doping, impairs stripe orders and helps stabilize superconductivity.},

Notably, we show that these novel quantum geometric quantities can drive an intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in spin-orbit coupled materials when the electron spin is steered by an oscillating magnetic field.

  abstract     = {We propose a scheme allowing coherent shaping, i.e., controlling both the amplitude and phase, of attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding a free-electron laser with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the Wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond x-ray free-electron lasers can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production and control of phase-stable pulse trains using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source II.},

  abstract     = {Here, a novel photonic spin Hall effect is demonstrated based on the spatially varying Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phases, aroused naturally in an -cut crystal via the Pockels effect. Applied with an electric field, the principal axes of crystal will rotate around the -axis with the rotation angle varying linearly with the component of the applied field. By depositing an asymmetric electrode pair on the crystal to induce inhomogeneously distributed electric fields, spatially varying rotations of the principal axes of crystal are generated, resulting in spatially varying PB phases. These spatially varying PB phases are redistributable by the applied voltage, different from those unchangeable PB phases aroused by the spatially varying orientations of anisotropic structure units such as patterned liquid crystals and metasurfaces. The redistributable PB phases can cause tunable separations of spin photons in the momentum space. The separation speed is measured as . These findings deepen the understanding of the geometric phase and pave the way for high-speed control of spin photons.},

While evolution of light in the bulk of photonic quasicrystals is well studied, experimental evidences of light localization near the edge of truncated photonic quasicrystal structures are practically absent. In this Letter, we observe both linear and nonlinear localization of light at the edges of radially cropped quasicrystal waveguide arrays, forming an aperiodic Penrose tiling. Our theoretical analysis reveals that for certain truncation radii, the system exhibits linear eigenstates localized at the edge of the truncated array, whereas for other radii, this localization does not occur, highlighting the significant influence of truncation on edge light localization. Using single-waveguide excitations, we experimentally confirm the presence of localized states in Penrose arrays inscribed by a femtosecond laser and investigate the effects of nonlinearity on these states. Our theoretical findings identify a family of edge solitons, and experimentally, we observe a transition from linear localized states to edge solitons as the power of the input pulse increases. Our results represent the first experimental demonstration of localization phenomena induced by the selective truncation of quasiperiodic photonic systems.},

Chiral metasurfaces are typically created by manipulating the geometry of nanostructures, such as three-dimensional helical structures and slanted structures. However, these approaches are generally challenging to implement experimentally in optical frequency ranges. Here, we present the achievement of significant chirality on planar lithium niobate metasurfaces. We theoretically demonstrate that the birefringence of lithium niobate enables a strong coupling between two nearly degenerate resonant modes when rotating the optical axis. Despite the achiral geometric morphology of the lithium niobate structure, we show that these mixed modes exhibit chirality and can produce nearly full circular dichroism signals. Moreover, we experimentally validate our theoretical proposal using our advanced process technique for lithium niobate nanostructures and the measured circular dichroism signal reaches .

Central to the performance of solid-state clock operation is an understanding of systematic shifts such as the temperature dependence of the clock transitions. In this work, we measure the four strongest transitions of thorium-229 in the same crystal at three temperature values: 150 K, 229 K, and 293 K. We find shifts of the unsplit frequency and the electric quadrupole splittings, corresponding to decreases in the electron density, electric field gradient, and field gradient asymmetry at the nucleus as temperature increases.

However, in the non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry, being ubiquitous in nature, exploring its non-Bloch topology has so far eluded experimental effort. Here, by introducing the concept of nonchiral non-Bloch invariants, we theoretically predict and experimentally identify the non-Bloch topological phase diagram of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry in discrete-time nonunitary quantum walks of single photons. Interestingly, we find that such topological invariants not only can distinguish topologically distinct gapped phases, but they also faithfully capture the corresponding gap closing in open-boundary spectrum at the phase boundary. Different topological regions are experimentally identified by measuring the featured discontinuities of the higher moments of the walker’s displacement, which amazingly match excellently with our defined non-Bloch invariants. Our work provides a useful platform to study the interplay among topology, symmetries, and the non-Hermiticity.},

A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics, “ self-trapped limit cycle, ” hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics.

  abstract     = {Extending quantum control to increasingly complex systems is crucial for both advancing quantum technologies and fundamental physics. In trapped ion systems, quantum logic techniques that combine a well-controlled logic species with a more complex spectroscopy species have proven to be a powerful tool for extending the range of accessible species. Here, we demonstrate that a quantum system as complex as Ti + 48 with its many metastable states can be controlled employing a combination of intrinsic thermalization due to collisions with background gas and quantum-logic techniques using a far-detuned Raman laser. The preparation of pure quantum states allows coherent manipulation and high resolution measurements of the Zeeman structure in Ti + 48 . The presented techniques are applicable to a wide range of ionic species giving access to a larger variety of systems for fundamental physics and constitute the first step for quantum-controlled spectroscopy of transition metals, relevant, e.g., for the interpretation of astrophysical spectra.},

  abstract     = {The probability per unit area for a radioactive nucleus (83.4 d half life) to absorb neutrons across resonance energies—its neutron-capture resonance integral—is the largest ever reported [Shusterman et al. , Phys. Rev. C 103 , 024614 (2021) .] and implies that the neutron-capture cross section is orders of magnitude larger than previously thought at energies relevant to nuclear test diagnostics and nucleosynthesis applications such as the process [Xiong et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 132 , 192701 (2024) .]. However, these applications require the shape of this cross section across a range of energies, not just this integral quantity. We measured the neutron total cross section from 0.0253 to 500 eV. Because the same resonances or other nuclear structure responsible for the neutron-capture cross section are reflected in the total cross section, we used these data to extract the former from the latter as a function of energy. Our data reveal a resonance at 0.171 eV and result in a thermal neutron-capture cross section of , in good agreement with the recently published value. In contrast, the neutron-capture resonance integral extracted from our data is and is roughly a factor of 200 smaller than the recently reported value. We discuss the impact of this difference on applications.},

  abstract     = {This Letter reports on the first cross-section measurements for the Sr 94 ( α , n ) Zr 97 and Kr 86 ( α , n ) Sr 89 reactions. In particular, our measurement of Sr 94 ( α , n ) Zr 97 is the first weak r -process reaction cross section obtained using a radioactive ion beam. This experiment was enabled by the use of novel solid helium targets, comprised of silicon thin films with high helium incorporation obtained via a sputtering technique. Yield measurements were performed at center-of-mass energies of 10.4 and 9.0 MeV for the Kr 86 ( α , n ) Sr 89 reaction, and 9.9 MeV for Sr 94 ( α , n ) Zr 97 , extending into the respective Gamow energy windows for a temperature of 5 GK. Reactions were uniquely identified by prompt γ rays detected in coincidence with heavy ions selected by a recoil mass spectrometer. The obtained cross sections are smaller than predicted for both reactions. In the case of Sr 94 ( α , n ) Zr 97 , the reaction rate found here is lowered by an order of magnitude at temperatures below 5 GK, which is expected to impact the predicted abundance of ruthenium, a signature weak r -process element.},

  abstract     = {We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principles numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.},

Data, collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of s NN = 8.16 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 175 nb − 1 , were used. The scaling factors in the ratio are determined using a novel approach based on the Z → μ − μ + cross sections measured in the same events.

  abstract     = {Recently, it was discovered that the proton structure at high energies exhibits maximal entanglement. This leads to a simple relation between the proton’s parton distributions and the entropy of hadrons produced in high-energy inelastic interactions, which has been experimentally confirmed. In this Letter, we extend this approach to the production of jets. Here, the maximal entanglement predicts a relation between the jet fragmentation function and the entropy of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. We test this relation using the ATLAS Collaboration data on jet production at the Large Hadron Collider, and find a good agreement between the prediction based on maximal entanglement within the jet and the data. This study represents the first use of a quantum entanglement framework in an experimental study of the hadronization process, offering a new perspective on the transition from perturbative to nonperturbative QCD. Our results open the door to a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum nature of hadronization.},

Using lattice quantum chromodynamics, we postdict the defining parameters for two short-lived resonances, the and , which manifest as complex energy poles in and scattering amplitudes, respectively. The calculation proceeds by first computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the two-hadron systems and then determining the amplitudes from the energies using the Lüscher formalism. The error budget includes a data-driven systematic error, obtained by scanning possible fit ranges and fit models to extract the spectrum from Euclidean correlators, as well as the scattering amplitudes from the latter. The final results, obtained by analytically continuing multiple parametrizations into the complex energy plane, are , and , where the subscript indicates the resonance and and stand for the mass and width, respectively, and where the first bracket indicates the statistical and the second bracket the systematic uncertainty.},

When gauged, it serves as the leading portal between the two sectors, providing an elegant, self-consistent scenario of light thermal inelastic dark matter. The inherent antisymmetrization leads to diminished annihilations at later times and suppressed direct detection. However, novel collider signatures offer tremendous prospects for discovery at Belle II.},

  abstract     = {Invisible axion models that solve the strong problem via the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism typically have a quality problem that arises from quantum gravity effects which violate all global symmetries. These models therefore require extreme fine-tuning of parameters for consistency. We present a new solution to the quality problem in a unified gauge model, where is an anomaly free axial gauge symmetry. PQ symmetry emerges as an accidental symmetry in this setup, which admits a PQ breaking scale as large as , allowing for the axion to be the cosmological dark matter. We call this a hybrid axion model due to its unique feature that it interpolates between the popular KSVZ and DFSZ axion models. Its predictions for the experimentally measurable axion couplings to the nucleon and electron are distinct from those of the usual models, a feature that can be used to test it. Furthermore, the model has no domain wall problem and it provides a realistic and predictive framework for fermion masses and mixings.},

Using a lowered energy threshold compared to the previous weakly interacting massive particle search, a blind analysis of [0.5, 5.0] keV nuclear recoil events reveals no significant signal excess over the background. XENONnT excludes spin-independent DM-nucleon cross sections at 90% confidence level for DM.

In this Letter, we tackle this long-standing challenge by integrating the Krylov subspace method–a celebrated tool from applied mathematics–into the framework of shadow tomography. The integrated technique, dubbed Krylov shadow tomography, enables us to formulate a strict hierarchy of nonpolynomial lower bounds on the QFI, among which the highest one matches the QFI exactly. We show that all the bounds can be expressed as expected values of the inverses of Hankel matrices, which are accessible via shadow tomography. Our Krylov shadow tomography therefore opens up a resource-efficient and experimentally feasible avenue to estimate not only nonpolynomial lower bounds but also the QFI itself.},

This limit indeed holds true for the vast majority of existing quantum magnetometers, including superconducting quantum interference devices and solid state spin and optically pumped atomic magnetometers. However, it can be surpassed by highly correlated spin systems, as recently demonstrated with a single-domain spinor BEC. Here, we show that similar and potentially much better resolution can be achieved with a hard ferromagnet levitated above a superconductor at cryogenic temperature. We demonstrate E R = ( 0.064 ± 0.010 ) ℏ and anticipate that E R &lt; 10 − 3 ℏ is within reach with near-future improvements. This finding opens the way to new applications in condensed matter, biophysics, and fundamental science. In particular, we propose an experiment to search for axionlike dark matter and project a sensitivity that is orders of magnitude better than in previous searches.},

  abstract     = {Because of the lack of a net magnetic moment, antiferromagnets possess a unique robustness to external magnetic fields and are thus predicted to play an important role in future magnetic technologies. However, this robustness also makes them quite difficult to control, and the development of novel methods to manipulate these systems with external stimuli is a fundamental goal of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we report evidence for a metastable reorientation of the order parameter in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor triggered by an ultrafast quench of the equilibrium order via photoexcitation above the band gap. The metastable state forms less than 10 ps after the excitation pulse, and persists for longer than 150 ps before decaying to the ground state via thermal fluctuations. Importantly, this transition cannot be induced thermodynamically, and requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium. Broadly speaking, this phenomenology is ultimately the result of large magnetoelastic coupling in combination with a relatively low symmetry of the magnetic ground state. Since neither of these properties are particularly uncommon in magnetic materials, the observations presented here imply a generic path toward novel device technology enabled by ultrafast dynamics in antiferromagnets.},

Erasing the mechanical history encoded in disordered materials constitutes a great challenge. Here, we address this problem using experiments and particle dynamic simulations for the case of colloidal glasses made of soft particles densely packed at high volume fractions. We propose a conceptual framework that connects residual stresses, directional memory, and aging of colloidal glasses to the distribution of local shear stresses in the shearing plane. The mean value of the distribution corresponds to the macroscopic stress, the skewness carries information about directional memory, and the standard deviation is related to mechanical aging. Periodically training soft particle glasses near the yield point with a sequence of stress-controlled oscillations provides a fine-tuning of the particle stress distribution. Asymmetric shear stress distributions resulting from previous flow are transformed into symmetric distributions, thereby successfully erasing residual stresses and directional memory. The same methodology is successfully applied to colloidal and polymer gels with thixotropic properties, suggesting that it is general and may be extended to other classes of disordered materials.},

  abstract     = {The disassembly of misfolded protein aggregates is a requirement for the proper functioning of cells. It has implications in multiple neuropathologies, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The active unbundling of fibrillar aggregates has recently been identified as a key rate-limiting step in the disassembly process. However, the nature of the underlying molecular mechanism remains an outstanding question. Here, we develop a coarse-grained computational approach from the atomistic structural information and show that the interactions of molecules tethered to fibrils lead to entropic forces consistent with the unbundling process observed in amyloid α-synuclein disaggregation by Hsp70. We uncover two main types of entropic effects, categorized as intraprotofilament and interprotofilament, which are differentially affected by the system parameters and conditions. Our results show that only highly efficient chaperone systems can overcome the free-energy cost of the lateral association between two protofilaments. Through the analysis of cryoelectron tomography and high-speed atomic force microscopy data, we find that the conditions for highly efficient entropic force generation are those typically achieved with cochaperone networks and ATP hydrolysis, which require energy expenditure but do not provide an enthalpic component to the separation force. We highlight the implications of these results for the design of targeted therapies for the underlying neuropathologies.},

In order to achieve low motional excitation during transport, we develop techniques to measure and mitigate the effect of the exposed dielectric surfaces used to deliver the integrated light to the ion. We also demonstrate simultaneous control of two ions in separate zones with low optical crosstalk and use this to perform simultaneous spectroscopy to correlate field noise between the two sites.

  abstract     = {Viscous electron flow exhibits exotic signatures such as superballistic conduction. In order to observe hydrodynamics effects, a 2D device where the current flow is as inhomogeneous as possible is desirable. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction, which is related to a transition from a noncollective to a collective regime of transport, behaves nonmonotonically with the magnetic field. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow and provide valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.},

Here we investigate static and dynamic magnetic properties of the cubic perovskite SrFeO 3 —a rare example of a centrosymmetric material hosting two types of topological spin textures: skyrmionlike and hedgehog-lattice phases. Our detailed magnetization and dilatometry measurements describe the domain selection processes and phase transitions in SrFeO 3 . Spin excitations are investigated using inelastic neutron scattering for all three zero-field phases. In the higher-temperature ordered phases, high-energy magnons increasingly lose coherence, so that spin fluctuations are dominated by a distinct quasielastic component at low energies. We anticipate that this could be generic to symmetric helimagnets in which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken by the magnetic order.},

In this paper, we report the first successful fabrication of a direct current superconducting quantum interference device (dc-SQUID) in the KTO system. The key device elements, superconducting weak links, are created by conductive atomic force microscope lithography, which can reversibly control the conductivity at the LAO/KTO (110) interface with nanoscale resolution. The periodic modulation of the SQUID critical current I c ( B ) with magnetic field corresponds well with our theoretical modeling, which reveals a large kinetic inductance of the superconducting two-dimensional electron gas in KTO. The kinetic inductance of the SQUID is tunable by electrical gating from the back, due to the large dielectric constant of KTO. The demonstration of weak links and SQUIDs in KTO broadens the scope for exploring the underlying physics of KTO superconductivity, including the role of spin-orbit coupling, pairing symmetry, and inhomogeneity. It also promotes KTO as a versatile platform for a growing family of quantum devices, which could be applicable in the realm of quantum computing and information.},

  abstract     = {Thermal transport is a crucial probe for studying excitations in insulators. In Mott insulators, the primary candidates for heat carriers are spins and phonons; which of these candidates dominates the thermal conductivity is a persistent issue. Typically, phonons dominate the longitudinal thermal conductivity while the thermal Hall effect (THE) is primarily associated with spins, requiring time-reversal symmetry breaking. The coupling between phonons and spins usually depends on spin-orbit interactions and is relatively weak. Here, we propose a new mechanism for this coupling and the associated THE: the skew scattering of phonons via spin fluctuations by the scalar spin chirality. This coupling does not require spin-orbit interactions and is ubiquitous in Mott insulators, leading to a thermal Hall angle on the order of 10 − 3 to 10 − 2 . Based on this mechanism, we investigate the THE in YMnO 3 with a trimerized triangular lattice where the THE beyond spins was recognized, and we predict the THE in the kagome and square lattices.},

Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states, but not both. Here, we achieve the first coexistence of thermalization and memory in a quantum system, where we use both Rydberg blockade and facilitation in an atom array to engineer a fragmentation of the Hilbert space into exponentially many disjointed subspaces. We find that the kinetically constrained system yields quantum many-body scars arising from the class of initial states, which generalizes beyond the scars previously reported in other quantum systems. When bringing multiple long-range interactions into resonance, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states belonging to different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work sheds light on a subtle aspect of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the long-standing tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.},

In this work, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate an unexpected rotational symmetry breaking in Landau levels formed in the unusual floating surface band of ZrSiS. We visualize a ubiquitous splitting of Landau levels into valley-polarized sublevels. We demonstrate methods to measure valley-selective Landau level spectroscopy, to infer unknown Landau level indices, and to precisely measure each valley’s Berry phase in a way that is agnostic to the band structure and topology of the system. These techniques allow us to measure each valley’s low-energy dispersion and infer a rigid valley-dependent contribution to the band energies. Ruling out spontaneous symmetry breaking by establishing the sample dependence of this valley splitting, we explain the effect in terms of residual strain. A quantitative estimate indicates that uniaxial strain can be measured to a precision of . The extreme valley polarization of the Landau levels results from as little as approximately 0.1% strain, and this suggests avenues for manipulation using deliberate strain engineering.},

We determine the core of the orbital angular momentum vortex to host an almost movable, twofold, spin-degenerate Weyl nodal line, a topological feature predicted to occur in certain nonsymmorphic crystals. These results establish bimodal dichroism in SX-ARPES as a robust approach to trace 3D orbital textures.

Despite their central role in quantum information, their relations to quantum chaotic evolution and, in particular, to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) are still largely debated issues. This work provides a bridge between the latter and designs through free probability theory. First, by introducing the more general notion of -freeness, we show that it can be used as an alternative probe to designs. In turn, free probability theory comes with several tools, useful, for instance, for the calculation of mixed moments or the so-called -fold quantum channels. Our second result is the connection to quantum dynamics. Quantum ergodicity and, correspondingly, ETH apply to a restricted class of physical observables, as already discussed in the literature. In this spirit, we show that unitary evolution with generic Hamiltonians always leads to freeness at sufficiently long times but only when the operators considered are restricted within the ETH class. Our results provide a direct link between unitary designs, quantum chaos, and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and shed new light on the universality of late-time quantum dynamics.},

The vibrational anomalies in glass at low temperatures are recovered in the stable solid limit, and floppy modes lacking restoring forces are predicted in unstable states below the jamming transition. Near the unjamming transition, the speed of sound v 0 ⊥ vanishes with ∝ − ε , where ε denotes the distance from the critical point. Additionally, the density of states develops a plateau, independent of ε above a frequency ω * which vanishes at the transition, ω * ∝ | ε | . We identify a characteristic length scale in the unjammed phase, λ − ⊥ ∝ 1 / ε , indicating the distance over which injected momentum remains correlated. We confirm the theoretical predictions with numerical solutions of a scalar ERM model, demonstrating overall good qualitative and partly quantitative agreement.},

  abstract     = {Atomic nuclei exhibit multiple energy scales ranging from hundreds of MeV in binding energies to fractions of an MeV for low-lying collective excitations. As the limits of nuclear binding are approached near the neutron and proton drip lines, traditional shell structure starts to melt with an onset of deformation and an emergence of coexisting shapes. It is a long-standing challenge to describe this multiscale physics starting from nuclear forces with roots in quantum chromodynamics. Here, we achieve this within a unified and nonperturbative quantum many-body framework that captures both short- and long-range correlations starting from modern nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory. The short-range (dynamic) correlations which account for the bulk of the binding energy are included within a symmetry-breaking framework, while long-range (static) correlations (and fine details about the collective structure) are included by employing symmetry projection techniques. Our calculations accurately reproduce—within theoretical error bars—available experimental data for low-lying collective states and the electromagnetic quadrupole transitions in Ne 20 − 30 . In addition, we reveal coexisting spherical and deformed shapes in Ne 30 , which indicates the breakdown of the magic neutron number N = 20 as the key nucleus O 28 is approached, and we predict that the drip line nuclei Ne 32 , 34 are strongly deformed and collective. By developing reduced-order models for symmetry-projected states, we perform a global sensitivity analysis and find that the subleading singlet S -wave contact and a pion-nucleon coupling strongly impact nuclear deformation in chiral effective field theory. The techniques developed in this work clarify how microscopic nuclear forces generate the multiscale physics of nuclei spanning collective phenomena as well as short-range correlations and allow one to capture emergent and dynamical phenomena in finite fermion systems such as atom clusters, molecules, and atomic nuclei.},

Our theoretical analysis shows that this necklacelike vortex pattern arises primarily from selective off-shell interference between vortex bound states of opposite angular momenta in the presence of rotational symmetry breaking due to disorders. This fascinating effect can be observed in a system with a small Fermi energy and wave vector, conditions fortuitously met in our samples. Our results not only disclose a novel vortex structure, but also unravel a completely new quantum phenomenon in the superconducting condensate.},

  abstract     = {The formation of patterns in driven systems has been studied extensively, and their emergence can be connected to a fine balance of instabilities and stabilization mechanisms. While the early phase of pattern formation can be understood on the basis of linear stability analyses, the longtime dynamics can only be described by accounting for the interactions between the excitations generated by the drive. Here, we observe the stabilization of square patterns in an interaction-driven, two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. These patterns emerge due to inherent high-order processes that become relevant in the regime of large phonon occupations. Theoretically, this can be understood as the emergence of a stable fixed point of coupled nonlinear amplitude equations, which include phonon-phonon interactions. We experimentally probe the predicted flows toward such a stable fixed point, as well as repulsion from a saddle fixed point, using the experimental control unique to quantum gases.},

With recent theory proposals and an experiment showing preliminary signs of topological order [G. Semeghini et al. , Science 374 , 1242 (2021) ], Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a promising platform to realize a quantum spin liquid. In this work, we propose a way to realize a U(1) quantum spin liquid in three spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of U(1) gauge theory in a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of “magnetic” monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of “electric” charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.},

  abstract     = {Quantum key distribution offers a promising avenue for establishing secure communication networks. However, its performance is significantly hampered by the conventional two-level information carriers (i.e., qubits) due to their limited information capacity and noise resilience. A fundamental approach to overcoming these limitations involves the adoption of high-dimensional qudits. Practical qudit platforms require robust propagation, outstanding controllability, and extreme compactness, to which integrated photonics provides a promising solution. Here, we achieved, for the first time, microlaser-enabled high-dimensional quantum communication through leveraging spin-orbit photon qudits, where the dynamical generation and manipulation of these multi-degrees-of-freedom complex quantum state are realized by a non-Hermitian-physics-driven integrated microlaser quantum transmitter. Such a microlaser photon manipulation, as a novel route towards high-dimensional quantum state generation, promises high energy efficiency, along with fast, compact, and precise qudit state reconfigurability. The four spin-orbit eigenstates emitted by the microlaser possess the same spatial-temporal structures, ensuring homogeneity between all qudit states used for key distribution, which effectively eliminates propagation dephasing and walk-off problems, thereby delivering the high-dimensional spin-orbit secret key generation to construct a robust quantum link. The demonstrated long-term system stability showcases the practical potential of the microlaser quantum transmitter, providing a critical step towards compact, high-information-capacity quantum communication networks.},

  abstract     = {At the fundamental level, full description of light-matter interaction requires quantum treatment of both matter and light. However, for standard light sources generating intense laser pulses carrying quadrillions of photons in a coherent state, the classical description of light during intense laser-matter interaction has been expected to be adequate. Here, we show how nonlinear optical response of matter can be controlled to generate dramatic deviations from this standard picture, including generation of several squeezed and entangled harmonics of the incident laser light. In particular, such nontrivial quantum states of harmonics are generated as soon as one of the harmonics induces a transition between different laser-dressed states of the material system. Such transitions generate an entangled light-matter wave function, which can generate quantum states of harmonics even in the absence of a quantum driving field or material correlations. In turn, entanglement of the material system with a single harmonic generates and controls entanglement between different harmonics. Hence, nonlinear media that are near resonant with at least one of the harmonics appear to be quite attractive for controlled generation of massively entangled quantum states of light. Our analysis opens remarkable opportunities at the interface of attosecond physics and quantum optics, with implications for quantum information science.},

  abstract     = {The self-assembly of particles into organized structures is a key feature of living organisms and a major engineering challenge. While it may proceed through the binding of perfectly matched, puzzle-piece-like particles, many other instances involve ill-fitting particles that must deform to fit together. These include some pathological proteins, which have a known propensity to form fibrous aggregates. Despite this observation, the general relationship between the individual characteristics of the particles and the overall structure of the aggregate is not understood. To elucidate it, we analytically and numerically study the self-assembly of two-dimensional, deformable ill-fitting particles. We find that moderately sticky particles tend to form equilibrium self-limited aggregates whose size is set by an elastic boundary layer associated with collective deformations that may extend over many particles. Particles with a soft internal deformation mode thus give rise to large aggregates. In addition, when the particles are incompressible, their aggregates tend to be anisotropic and fiberlike. Our results are preserved in a more complex particle model with randomly chosen elastic properties. This indicates that generic proteinlike characteristics such as allostery and incompressibility could favor the formation of fibers in protein aggregation, and suggests design principles for artificial self-assembling structures.},

Combining magnetic frustration with gate-voltage-controlled tuning of individual Josephson couplings provides deterministic control of the harmonic content of the rhombus CPR. We show that, for balanced Josephson couplings at full frustration, the hybrid rhombus displays a π -periodic cos ( 2 φ ) potential, indicating coherent charge- 4 e transport. Tuning away from the balanced configuration, we observe a superconducting diode effect with efficiency exceeding 25%. These results showcase the potential of hybrid Josephson rhombi as fundamental building blocks for noise-resilient qubits and quantum devices with custom transport properties.},

  abstract     = {Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special nonequilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally symmetric limit . First, we numerically establish that, despite the fact that spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal , the towers of energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as is increased and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor nonlinearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analytically solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for (with ). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for an arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g., near dynamical critical points or in the presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a by-product, we find a predictive criterion for the presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for , beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.},

  abstract = {The buckling of a soft elastic sample under growth or swelling has highlighted a new interest in materials science, morphogenesis, and biology or physiology. Indeed, the change of mass or volume is a common fact of any living species, and on a scale larger than the cell size, a macroscopic view can help to explain many features of common observation. Many morphologies of soft materials result from the accumulation of elastic compressive stress due to growth and thus from the minimization of a nonlinear elastic energy. The similarity between growth and compression of a piece of rubber has revived the instability formalism of nonlinear elastic samples in compression and, in particular, Biot’s instability. Here a modern treatment of this instability is presented in the light of complex analysis, and the richness of possible profiles that an interface can present under buckling, even if one restricts oneself to the two spatial dimensions, is demonstrated. Special attention is given to wrinkles, folds, and cusps, a surprising observation in swelling gels or clays, and a new threshold for crease patterns below the traditional Biot threshold is discovered. The standard techniques of complex analysis, nonlinear bifurcation theory, and path-independent integrals are revisited to highlight the role of physical parameters at the origin of the observed patterns below and above the Biot threshold.},

  abstract = {The traditional view from particle physics is that quantum-gravity effects should become detectable only at extremely high energies and small length scales. Owing to the significant technological challenges involved, there has been limited progress in identifying experimentally detectable effects that can be accessed in the foreseeable future. However, in recent decades the size and mass of quantum systems that can be controlled in the laboratory have reached unprecedented scales, enabled by advances in ground-state cooling and quantum-control techniques. Preparations of massive systems in quantum states pave the way for the explorations of a low-energy regime in which gravity can be both sourced and probed by quantum systems. Such approaches constitute an increasingly viable alternative to accelerator-based, laser-interferometric, torsion-balance, and cosmological tests of gravity. In this review an overview of proposals where massive quantum systems act as interfaces between quantum mechanics and gravity is provided. Conceptual difficulties in the theoretical description of quantum systems in the presence of gravity are discussed, tools for modeling massive quantum systems in the laboratory are reviewed, and an overview of the current state-of-the-art experimental landscape is provided. Proposals covered in this review include precision tests of gravity, tests of gravitationally induced wave-function collapse and decoherence, and gravity-mediated entanglement. The review concludes with an outlook and summary of the key questions raised.},
