Differential membrane contractions between cells significantly influence segregation.

The interface decay exponent is close to λ ∼ 1 / 3 , differing from previous cluster fusion and diffusion model predictions.},

Selecting an interaction potential for which a LLPT occurs in the bulk liquid, we conduct simulations of supercooled water nanodroplets having between 1000 and 80000 molecules. We show that as the droplet size decreases, the Laplace pressure grows large enough to drive the droplets through the transition from the low-density to the high-density liquid phase, and that all droplets in this size range are large enough to have cores exhibiting the structure and properties of bulk water. To guide experiments, we estimate the range of values for the critical pressure of the LLPT in real water that can be observed using nanodroplets, and propose structural and dynamical measures by which the LLPT in nanodroplets can be detected.},

In our work, we investigate the relationship between higher-order mechanisms and higher-order behavioral observables in two representative models with group interactions: a simplicial Ising model and a social contagion model. In both systems, we find that group (higher-order) interactions show emergent synergistic (higher-order) behavior. The emergent synergy appears only at the group level and depends in a complex, nonlinear way on the trade-off between the strengths of the low- and higher-order mechanisms and is invisible to low-order behavioral observables. Our work sets the basis for systematically investigating the relation between causal mechanisms and behavioral patterns in complex networked systems with group interactions, offering a robust methodological framework to tackle this challenging task.},

  abstract     = {The synergistic control of light’s frequency and orbital angular momentum (OAM) via integrated nonlinear ring microresonators is crucial for creating spatiotemporal optical waveforms and advancing optical metrology. A direct analog of this capability in acoustics is challenging due to the nonlinearity-based mechanisms’ dependence on external driving and limited frequency conversion efficiency. Here, we present an acoustic synthesized comb structure derived from spatiotemporal metasurfaces, concurrently controlling frequency and OAM characteristics with high conversion efficiency and removing the constraints of critical driving frequency and power level in nonlinear mechanisms. By optimizing comb structures, energy distributions among OAM modes are adjusted to different frequency lines. We finally propose spatiotemporal metalens devices based on vortex-frequency combs, enabling synchronously multiple-order spatial differential operations for parallel data processing. This Letter is groundbreaking in integrating spectral- and spatial-domain acoustic waves, promising multifunctional imaging and advantages in spatiotemporal beams.},

  abstract     = {Using first-principles electronic structure calculation, we demonstrate the spin dissipation process in bulk Fe by orbital excitations within the energy bands of pure spin character. The variation of orbitals in the intraband transitions provides an efficient channel to convert spin to orbital angular momentum with spin-orbit interaction. This mechanism dominates the Gilbert damping of Fe below room temperature. The theoretical prediction is confirmed by the ferromagnetic resonance experiment performed on single-crystal Fe(001) films. A significant thickness-dependent damping oscillation is found at low temperature induced by the quantum well states of the corresponding energy bands. Our findings not only explain the microscopic nature of the recently reported ultralow damping of Fe-based alloys but also help for the understanding of the transport and dissipation process of orbital currents.},

Its transition temperature is high, reaching a few percent of the Fermi temperature scale. Here, we advance a mechanism for superconductivity based on the notion that electronic topology enables quantum fluctuations in a suitable regime of intermediate correlations. In this regime, the Coulomb interaction requires that an active topological flat band and nearby wider bands are considered together. Compact molecular orbitals arise, which give rise to quantum fluctuations through topology-dictated hybridization with the other molecular orbitals. The hybridization competes with the active flat band’s natural tendency toward static electronic ordering, thereby weakening the latter; we link this effect with certain salient observations by experiments. Furthermore, the competition yields a quantum critical regime where quasiparticles are lost. The corresponding quantum critical fluctuations drive superconductivity. Broader implications and new connections among correlated materials platforms are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The recent observation of high- T c superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La 3 Ni 2 O 7 under pressure has garnered significant interest. While researches have predominantly focused on the role of electron-electron interactions in the superconducting mechanism, the impact of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) has remained elusive and unexplored. In this Letter, we perform first-principles calculations to study the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling within La 3 Ni 2 O 7 under pressure and explore the interplay between EPC and electronic interactions on the superconductivity by employing functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. Our calculations reveal that EPC alone is insufficient to trigger superconductivity in La 3 Ni 2 O 7 under pressure. We identify unique out-of-plane and in-plane breathing phonon modes which selectively couple with the Ni d z 2 and d x 2 − y 2 orbitals, showcasing an orbital-selective EPC. Within the bilayer two-orbital model, it is revealed that solely electronic interactions foster s ± -wave pairing characterized by notable frustration in the band space, leading to a relatively low transition temperature. Remarkably, we find that the out-of-plane EPC can act in concert with electronic interactions to promote the interlayer pairing in the d z 2 orbital, partially releasing the pairing frustration and thus elevating T c . In contrast, the inclusion of in-plane EPC only marginally affects the superconductivity, distinct from the cuprates. Potential experimental implications in La 3 Ni 2 O 7 are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors the chiral A phase of the superfluid He 3 over the time-reversal invariant B phase. Confining the superfluid He 3 into a cavity of height D of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length ξ 0 —ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar)—extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures P and temperatures T where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this Letter, the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid He 4 film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full P − T phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit D / ξ 0 = 1 , where D = 80 nm . The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully gapped two-dimensional p x + i p y superfluid under more extreme confinement.},

  abstract     = {The standard magnetorotational instability (SMRI) with a magnetic field component parallel to the rotation axis is widely believed to be responsible for the fast accretion in astronomical disks. In conventional base flows with a Keplerian profile or an ideal Couette profile, most studies focus on axisymmetric SMRI, since excitation of nonaxisymmetric SMRI in such flows requires a magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) more than an order of magnitude larger. Here, we report that, in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow, nonaxisymmetric SMRI with an azimuthal mode number m = 1 can be triggered by a free-shear layer in the base flow at Rm ≳ 1 , the same threshold as for axisymmetric SMRI. Global linear analysis reveals that the free-shear layer reduces the required Rm, possibly by introducing an extremum in the vorticity of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations validate the results from linear analysis and confirm that a novel instability recently discovered experimentally [Wang et al. , Nat. Commun. 13 , 4679 (2022) ] is the nonaxisymmetric m = 1 SMRI. Our finding has astronomical implications as free-shear layers are ubiquitous in celestial systems, such as the disk-star boundary layer, the solar tachocline, and the edge of planet-opened gaps in protoplanetary disks.},

The coupling between the atoms and the cavity field is induced by a transverse pump beam. Taking fluctuations around the mean-field solutions into account, we find that a transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths two self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a bistability. We show that the bistable behavior is induced by the atoms-cavity fluctuations and is not captured by the mean-field approach.},

Thanks to their tunable-range interactions, they are promising building blocks for quantum simulators. Here, we study the dynamics of an atom-photon bound state emerging from coupling a frequency-tunable quantum emitter—a transmon-type superconducting circuit—to the band edge of a microwave metamaterial. Employing precise temporal control over the frequency detuning of the emitter from the band edge, we examine the transition from adiabatic to nonadiabatic behavior in the formation of the bound state and its melting into the propagating modes of the metamaterial. Moreover, we experimentally observe multimode emission from the bound state, triggered by a fast change of the emitter’s frequency. Our Letter offers insight into the dynamic preparation of APBS and provides a method to characterize their photonic content, with implications in quantum optics and quantum simulation.},

  abstract     = {Rydberg dressing is a powerful tool for entanglement generation in long-lived atomic states. While already employed effectively in several demonstrations, a key challenge for this technique is the collective loss triggered by blackbody-radiation-driven transitions to contaminant Rydberg states of opposite parity. We demonstrate the rapid removal of such contaminants using autoionization (AI) transitions found in alkaline-earth-like atoms. The AI is shown to be compatible with coherent operation of an array of optical clock qubits. By incorporating AI pulses into a stroboscopic Rydberg dressing (SRD) sequence, we enhance lifetimes by an order of magnitude for system sizes of up to 144 atoms, while maintaining an order of magnitude larger duty cycle than previously achieved. To highlight the utility of our approach, we use the AI-enhanced SRD protocol to improve the degree of achieved spin-squeezing during early time dressing dynamics. These results bring Rydberg dressing lifetimes closer to fundamental limits, opening the door to previously infeasible dressing proposals.},

However, EPR spectroscopy using NV ensembles is less efficient due to inhomogeneities in both sensors and targets. Spectral line broadening induced by ensemble averaging is even detrimental to spectroscopy. Here we show a kind of cross-relaxation EPR spectroscopy at zero field, where the sensor is tuned by an amplitude-modulated control field to match the target. The modulation makes detection robust to the sensors inhomogeneity, while zero-field EPR is naturally robust to the targets inhomogeneity. We demonstrate an efficient EPR measurement on an ensemble of ∼ 30 000 NV centers.

In this Letter, we introduce a family of multiplayer quantum games for which topologically ordered phases of matter are a resource yielding quantum advantage. Unlike previous examples, quantum advantage persists away from the exactly solvable point and is robust to arbitrary local perturbations, irrespective of system size. We demonstrate this robustness experimentally on Quantinuum’s H1-1 quantum computer by playing the game with a continuous family of randomly deformed toric code states that can be created with constant-depth circuits leveraging midcircuit measurements and unitary feedback. We are thus able to tune through a topological phase transition—witnessed by the loss of robust quantum advantage—on currently available quantum hardware. This behavior is contrasted with an analogous family of deformed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, for which arbitrarily weak local perturbations destroy quantum advantage in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we discuss a topological interpretation of the game, which leads to a natural generalization involving an arbitrary number of players.},

The trade-off for this enhanced charging power is a relative inefficiency since a large fraction of the incoming energy is lost through spontaneous emission to the environment. Nevertheless, we find that the system can store a large amount of coherence and release the stored energy coherently through spontaneous emission, again with a power scaling as N 2 .},

Yet in practice, the outcome of a self-assembly process is often controlled by kinetic pathways. Here we present an efficient machine-learning-guided design algorithm to identify globally optimal interaction potentials that maximize both the thermodynamic yield and kinetic accessibility of a target polymorph. We show that optimal potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating the possibility of a trade-off between the thermodynamic and kinetic objectives. Although the extent of this trade-off depends on the target polymorph and the assembly conditions, we generically find that the trade-off arises from a competition among alternative polymorphs: The most kinetically optimal potentials, which favor the target polymorph on short timescales, tend to stabilize a competing polymorph at longer times. Our work establishes a general-purpose approach for multiobjective self-assembly optimization, reveals fundamental trade-offs between crystallization speed and defect formation in the presence of competing polymorphs, and suggests guiding principles for materials design algorithms that optimize for kinetic accessibility.},

  abstract     = {Landau’s Fermi-liquid (FL) theory has been successful at the phenomenological description of the normal phase of many different Fermi systems. Using a dilute atomic Fermi fluid with tunable interactions, we investigate the microscopic basis of Landau’s theory with a system describable from first principles. We study transport properties of an interacting Fermi gas by measuring its density response to a periodic external perturbation. In an ideal Fermi gas, we measure for the first time the celebrated Lindhard function. As the system is brought from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, we observe the emergence of sound and find that the experimental observations are quantitatively understood with a first-principle transport equation for the FL. When the system is more strongly interacting, we find deviations from such predictions. Finally, we measure the momentum-space shape of the quasiparticle excitations and see how it evolves from the collisionless to the collisional regime. Our study establishes this system as a clean platform for studying Landau’s theory of the FL and paves the way for extending the theory to more exotic conditions, such as nonlinear dynamics and FLs with strong correlations in versatile settings.},

  abstract     = {The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in developing a controlled real-space renormalization group (RG) scheme. Numerically approximate fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the “boundary-changing operators” (BCO) on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide concrete examples, such as Ising, Yang-Lee, and tricritical Ising models, to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. The BCO descendants turn out to be an optimal basis such that truncation in bond dimensions naturally produces comparable accuracies with the leading existing FP algorithms. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door toward understanding CFT in higher dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Following a consistent geometrical description previously introduced [ Quantum 8 , 1466 (2024) ], we present an exact method for obtaining canonically quantizable Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear, nonreciprocal quasilumped electrical networks. We identify and classify singularities arising in the quest for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasilumped element networks via the Faddeev-Jackiw technique. We offer systematic solutions to cases previously considered singular—a major challenge in the context of canonical circuit quantization. The solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to multiport nonreciprocal lumped-element networks, with intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff. On the way, we naturally extend the canonical quantization of transmission lines coupled through frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates the characterization of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments. This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, using continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We provide a tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of special interest in the context of canonical quantization of superconducting networks. For instance, this work provides a solid ground for a precise nondivergent input-output theory in the presence of nonreciprocal devices, e.g., within (chiral) waveguide QED platforms.},

  abstract     = {Cat qubits, a type of bosonic qubit encoded in a harmonic oscillator, can exhibit an exponential noise bias against bit-flip errors with increasing mean photon number. Here, we focus on cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation, where pairs of photons are added and removed from a harmonic oscillator by an auxiliary, lossy buffer mode. This process requires a large loss rate and strong nonlinearities of the buffer mode that must not degrade the coherence and linearity of the oscillator. In this work, we show how to overcome this challenge by coloring the loss environment of the buffer mode with a multipole filter and optimizing the circuit to take into account additional inductances in the buffer mode. Using these techniques, we achieve near-ideal enhancement of cat-qubit bit-flip times with increasing photon number, reaching over 0.1 s with a mean photon number of only 4. Concurrently, our cat qubit remains highly phase coherent, with phase-flip times corresponding to an effective lifetime of , comparable with the bare oscillator lifetime. We achieve this performance even in the presence of an ancilla transmon, used for reading out the cat-qubit states, by engineering a tunable oscillator-ancilla dispersive coupling. Furthermore, the low nonlinearity of the harmonic oscillator mode allows us to perform pulsed cat-qubit stabilization, an important control primitive, where the stabilization can remain off for a significant fraction (e.g., two-thirds) of a cycle without degrading bit-flip times. These advances are important for the realization of scalable error correction with cat qubits, where large noise bias and low phase-flip error rate enable the use of hardware-efficient outer error-correcting codes.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here, we explore a surprising connection between mixed-state entanglement and ’t Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in d space dimensions with anomalous symmetry G where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology H d + 2 [ G , U ( 1 ) ] . We show that any mixed state ρ that is strongly symmetric under G , in the sense that G ρ ∝ ρ is necessarily ( d + 2 )-nonseparable, i.e., is not the mixture of tensor products of d + 2 states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any ( d + 2 )-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in d ≤ 1 and plausibility arguments in d &gt; 1 . The anomaly-nonseparability connection, thus, allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in d = 1 we find an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also analyze a mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly. We find that, while strong-weak mixed anomaly, in general, does not constrain quantum entanglement, it does constrain long-range correlations of mixed states in nontrivial ways. Namely, such states are not symmetrically invertible and not gapped Markovian, generalizing familiar properties of anomalous pure states.},

  abstract     = {We find that the presence of strong non-Abelian symmetries can lead to highly entangled stationary states even for unital quantum channels. We derive exact expressions for the bipartite logarithmic negativity, Rényi negativities, and operator space entanglement for stationary states restricted to one symmetric subspace, with focus on the trivial subspace. We prove that these apply to open quantum evolutions whose commutants, characterizing all strongly conserved quantities, correspond to either the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra or the Read-Saleur commutants. The latter provides an example of quantum fragmentation, whose dimension is exponentially large in system size. We find a general upper bound for all these quantities given by the logarithm of the dimension of the commutant on the smaller bipartition of the chain. As Abelian examples, we show that strong U(1) symmetries and classical fragmentation lead to separable stationary states in any symmetric subspace. In contrast, for non-Abelian SU ( N ) symmetries, both logarithmic and Rényi negativities scale logarithmically with system size. Finally, we prove that, while Rényi negativities with n &gt; 2 scale logarithmically with system size, the logarithmic negativity (as well as generalized Rényi negativities with n &lt; 2 ) exhibits a volume-law scaling for the Read-Saleur commutants. Our derivations rely on the commutant possessing a Hopf algebra structure in the limit of infinitely large systems and, hence, also apply to finite groups and quantum groups.},

  abstract     = {Within multicellular living systems, cells coordinate their positions with spatiotemporal accuracy to form various tissue structures and control development. These arrangements can be regulated by tissue geometry, biochemical cues, as well as mechanical perturbations. However, how cells pack during dynamic three-dimensional multicellular architectures formation remains unclear. Here, examining a growing spherical multicellular system, human lung alveolospheres, we observe an emergence of hexagonal packing order and a structural transition of cells that comprise the spherical epithelium. Surprisingly, the cell packing behavior on the spherical surface of lung alveolospheres resembles hard-disks packing on spheres, where the less deformable cell nuclei act as effective “hard disks” and prevent cells from getting too close. Nucleus-to-cell size ratio increases during lung spheroids growth; as a result, we find more hexagon-concentrated cellular packing with increasing bond orientational order. Furthermore, by osmotically changing the compactness of cells on alveolospheres, we observe a more ordered packing when nucleus-to-cell size ratio increases, and vice versa. These more ordered cell packing characteristics are consistent with reduced cell dynamics, together suggesting that better cellular packing stabilizes local cell neighborhoods and may regulate more complex biological functions such as cellular maturation and tissue morphogenesis.},

With neuroevolution potentials, molecular dynamics simulation of this structure successfully reproduced the glasslike in-plane lattice thermal conductivity observed in experiments. The predicted out-of-plane thermal conductivity decreases with temperature, exhibiting a crystalline trend that is consistent with our measurements.

  abstract     = {A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges and their weight distribution. The status quo in this context is based on regularization combined with cross-validation. However, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity, i.e., abundance of zero weights, with weight “shrinkage.” This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster and simpler to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data, instead of many fits for multiple data splits and choice of regularization parameter. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of reconstructed edges and their weight distribution to be known in advance. In a series of examples, we also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving on the order of species and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of potential interventions and tipping points in the system.},

Given a Hamiltonian, a pure state is defined to be metastable when all sufficiently local operators either stabilize the state or raise its average energy. We prove that short-range-entangled metastable states are necessarily eigenstates (scars) of a perturbatively close Hamiltonian. Given any metastable eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, in the presence of perturbations, we prove the presence of prethermal behavior: Local correlation functions decay at a rate bounded by a timescale nonperturbatively long in the inverse metastability radius, rather than Fermi’s golden rule. Inspired by this general theory, we prove that the lifetime of the false vacuum in certain -dimensional quantum models grows at least as fast as , where is the relative energy density of the false vacuum; this lower bound matches, for the first time, explicit calculations using quantum field theory. We identify metastable states at finite energy density in the PXP model, along with exponentially many metastable states in “helical” spin chains and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our inherently quantum formalism reveals precise connections between many problems, including prethermalization, robust quantum scars, and quantum nucleation theory, and applies to systems without known semiclassical and/or field-theoretic limits.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric domain walls are not just static geometric boundaries between polarization domains; they are, in fact, dynamic and functional interfaces with the potential for diverse technological applications. While the roles of ferroelectric domain walls in dielectric and piezoelectric responses are better understood, their impact on pyroelectric response remains underexplored. Here, the pyroelectric response of (001)-, (101)-, and (111)-oriented epitaxial heterostructures of the tetragonal ferroelectric PbZr 0.2 Ti 0.8 O 3 is probed. These differently oriented heterostructures exhibit the same type of 90° ferroelastic domain walls, but their geometry and density vary with orientation. In turn, piezoresponse force microscopy and direct pyroelectric measurements reveal that (111)-oriented heterostructures exhibit both the highest density of domain walls and pyroelectric coefficients. By varying the thickness of these (111)-oriented heterostructures (from 100 to 280 nm), the density of domain walls can be varied, and a direct correlation between domain-wall density and pyroelectric coefficients is found. Molecular-dynamics simulations confirm these findings and reveal a novel domain-wall contribution to pyroelectric response in that the volume of the material in or near the domain walls exhibits a significantly higher pyroelectric coefficient as compared to the bulk of the domains. Analysis suggests that the domain-wall material has a higher responsivity of the polarization to both external fields and temperature. This study sheds light on the microscopic origin of domain-wall contributions to pyroelectricity and provides a pathway to controlling this effect.},

  abstract     = {It was suggested [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 , 200403 (2008) ] that an avalanche of electron-positron pairs can be triggered in the laboratory by a standing wave generated by intense laser fields. Here, we present a general solution to the long-standing problem of the avalanche growth rate calculation. We provide a simple formula that accounts for the damping of the growth rate due to pair and photon migration from the region of prolific generation. We apply our model to a variety of 3D field configurations including focused laser beams and show that (i) the particle yield for the full range of intensity able to generate an avalanche can be predicted, (ii) a critical intensity threshold due to migration is identified, and (iii) the effect of migration is negligible at a higher intensity and the local growth rate dominates. Excellent agreement with Monte Carlo and self-consistent particle-in-cell simulations is shown. The growth rate calculation allows us to predict when abundant pair production will induce a backreaction on the generating field due to plasma collective effects and screening. Our model can be applied to study the generation of electron-positron pair avalanches in realistic fields to plan future experiments at ultrahigh-intensity laser facilities.},

  abstract     = {Soliton waves are sustained by a self-created index potential well, and their interactions occur when the potential well is invaded by other solitons. The interactions are important to soliton compounds in plasma, Bose-Einstein condensation, and optical systems. In optical microresonators, interactions between counterpropagating (CP) solitons can lead to Vernier frequency locking (VFL), which is invaluable for dual-comb applications. Here, we synthesize CP solitons with VFL in an integrated silicon nitride microresonator and characterize the rhythmic soliton interaction dynamics. Seconds-long mutual coherence between solitons arises passively from the interactions. The interactions also cause the solitons to oscillate periodically. This temporal motion is discerned by frequency-domain measurements of the instantaneous frequency changes and microcomb sidebands. A theory is derived to describe the sideband strength and leveraged to retrieve the motion trajectory. The complex soliton motion trajectory is further measured by optical cross-correlation using a CP soliton trimer state. We further prove that precise dual-comb spectroscopy with a single interferogram and an acquisition time of is feasible using these solitons, but the temporal motion limits the dynamic range. Our work establishes the rhythmic soliton interaction dynamics and reveals the characteristics of VFL solitons in the silicon nitride platform, which can be used to guide the design of integrated dual-comb systems.},

Of particular interest is the electric-field-induced 180° perpendicular magnetization switching, which currently remains challenging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the electric-field switching of perpendicular magnetization in a ferrimagnet FeTb in the absence of external magnetic fields. By utilizing ionic liquid gating at room temperature, the ferrimagnetic order can be reversibly switched as a result of the hydrogen injection or extraction under positive or negative gate voltages. Specifically, the hydrogen content pronouncedly modifies the spin and orbital magnetic moments of the Tb sublattice, which subsequently influences the relative magnitude and/or direction of the Fe and Tb sublattice magnetizations, resulting in the switching of ferrimagnetic order. More importantly, we demonstrate a prototype room-temperature three-terminal magnetoelectric memory device by incorporating the giant magnetoresistance effect with electric-field controllable ferrimagnetism. Our results reveal the prosperous aspects of ionic gating for enabling the electric-field-controllable magnetoelectric memory or logic devices.},

  abstract     = {Biological memory is known to be flexible—memory formation and recall depend on factors such as the behavioral context of the organism. However, this property is often ignored in associative memory models, leaving it unclear how memories can be organized and recalled when subject to contextual control. Because of the lack of a rigorous analytical framework, it is also unknown how contextual control affects memory stability, storage capacity, and information content. Here, we bring the dynamic nature of memory to the fore by introducing a novel model of associative memory, which we refer to as the context-modular memory network. In our model, stored memory patterns are associated to one of several background network states, or contexts. Memories are accessible when their corresponding context is active, and are otherwise inaccessible. Context modulates the effective network connectivity by imposing a specific configuration of neuronal and synaptic gating—gated neurons (synapses) have their activity (weights) momentarily silenced, thereby reducing interference from memories belonging to other contexts. Memory patterns are randomly and independently chosen, while neuronal and synaptic gates may be selected randomly or optimized through a process of contextual synaptic refinement. Through analytic and numerical results, we show that context-modular memory networks can exhibit both improved memory capacity and differential control of memory stability with random gating (especially for neuronal gating). For contextual synaptic refinement, we devise a method in which synapses are gated off for a given context if they destabilize the memory patterns in that context, drastically improving memory capacity and enabling even more precise control over memory stability. Notably, synaptic refinement allows for patterns to be accessible in multiple contexts, stabilizing memory patterns even for weight matrices that alone do not contain any information about the memory patterns, such as Gaussian random matrices. Overall, our model integrates recent ideas about context-dependent memory organization with classic associative memory models and proposes a rigorous theory which can act as a framework for future work. Furthermore, our work carries important implications for the understanding of biological memory storage and recall in the brain, such as highlighting an intriguing trade-off between memory capacity and accessibility.},

To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix. We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information.},

In this study, we explore quantum systems subjected to a quasiperiodic drive. Leveraging a strongly interacting spin ensemble in diamond, we identify the emergence of long-lived discrete time quasicrystals. Unlike conventional time crystals, time quasicrystals exhibit robust subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the multifrequency nature of the quasiperiodic drive allows for the formation of diverse patterns associated with different discrete time quasicrystalline phases.

The process can significantly contribute to the high biological effectiveness of heavy-ion irradiation and thus might play an essential role in many radiotherapy techniques. Inner-valence ionization of the cluster initiates ICD and triggers proton transfer between water molecules, producing destructive low-energy electrons, HO • radicals, and hydrated protons. Notably, the efficiency of ICD was found to increase dramatically with the number of water molecules, making ICD the dominant decay mechanism after inner-valence ionization.

By introducing moiré superlattices in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, we observe a cascade of topological phase transitions at quarter electron filling of a moiré band with the Chern number tunable from , 1, to 2. Furthermore, integrating monolayer tungsten diselenide at the moiréless interface of rhombohedral decalayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride superlattices stabilizes the Chern insulators, enabling quantized anomalous Hall resistance of .

  abstract     = {Hybrid systems of single, trapped ions embedded in quantum gases are a promising platform for quantum simulations and the study of long-range interactions in the ultracold regime. Feshbach resonances allow for experimental control over the character and strength of the atom-ion interaction. However, the complexity of atom-ion Feshbach spectra, e.g., due to second-order spin-orbit coupling, requires a detailed experimental understanding of the resonance properties—such as the contributing open-channel partial waves. In this work, we immerse a single barium ( ) ion in a bath of lithium (Li) atoms spin polarized in their hyperfine ground state to investigate the collision energy dependence of magnetically tunable atom-ion Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate fine control over the kinetic energy of the ion and employ it to explore three-body recombination in the transition from the many- to the few-partial wave regime, marked by a sudden increase of resonant loss. In a dense spectrum—with on average 0.58(1) resonances per Gauss—we select a narrow, isolated feature and characterize it as an -wave resonance. We introduce a quantum recombination model that allows us to distinguish it from higher-partial-wave resonances. Furthermore, in a magnetic field range with no significant loss at the lowest collision energies, we identify a higher-partial-wave resonance that appears and peaks only when we increase the energy to around the -wave limit. Our results demonstrate that hybrid atom-ion traps can reach collision energies well in the ultracold regime and that the ion’s kinetic energy can be employed to tune the collisional complex to resonance, paving the way for fast control over the interaction in settings where magnetic field variations are detrimental to coherence.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems often leads to exotic elementary excitations. Quantum spin liquids provide a paradigmatic example, where the elementary excitations are described by fractional quasiparticles such as spinons. However, such fractional quasiparticles behave differently from electrons, making their experimental identification challenging. Here, we theoretically investigate the spin Seebeck effect, which is a thermoelectric response via a spin current, as an efficient probe of the fractional quasiparticles in quantum spin liquids, focusing on the Kitaev honeycomb model. By comprehensive studies using real-time dynamics, perturbation theory, and linear spin-wave theory based on the tunnel spin-current theory, we find that the spin current is induced by thermal gradient in the Kitaev spin liquid via the low-energy fractional Majorana excitations. This identification underscores the ability of Majorana fermions to carry spin current, despite lacking spin angular momentum. Furthermore, we find that the induced spin current changes its sign depending on the sign of the Kitaev interaction, indicating that the Majorana fermions contribute to the spin current with (up-) down-spin-like nature when the exchange coupling is (anti)ferromagnetic. Thus, in contrast to the negative spin current already found in a one-dimensional quantum spin liquid, our calculation reveals that the spin Seebeck effect can exhibit either positive or negative signals, contingent upon the nature of fractional excitations in the quantum spin liquids. We also clarify contrasting field-angle dependence between the Kitaev spin liquid in the low-field limit and the high-field ferromagnetic state, which is useful for the experimental identification. Our finding suggests that the spin Seebeck effect could be used not only to detect fractional quasiparticles emerging in quantum spin liquids but also to generate and control them.},

  abstract     = {Moiré heterostructures consisting of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers and homobilayers have emerged as a promising material platform to study correlated electronic states. Optical signatures of strong correlations in the form of Mott-Wigner states and fractional Chern insulators have already been observed in TMD monolayers and their twisted bilayers. In this work, we use a moiré substrate containing a twisted hexagonal boron nitride ( -BN) interface to externally generate a superlattice potential for the TMD layer: The periodic structure of ferroelectric domains in -BN creates a purely electrostatic potential for charge carriers. We find direct evidence for the induced moiré potential in the emergence of new excitonic resonances at integer fillings and our observation of an enhancement of the trion binding energy by . A theoretical model for exciton-electron interactions allows us to directly determine the moiré potential modulation of from the measured trion binding energy shift. We obtain direct evidence for charge order linked to electronic Mott-Wigner states at filling factors and through the associated exciton umklapp resonances.},

  abstract     = {Water wires, quasi-one-dimensional chains composed of hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) water molecules, play a fundamental role in numerous chemical, physical, and physiological processes. Yet direct experimental detection of water wires has been elusive so far. Based on advanced ab initio many-body theory that includes electron-hole interactions, we report that optical absorption spectroscopy can serve as a sensitive probe of water wires and their ordering. In both liquid and solid water, the main peak of the spectrum is discovered to be a charge-transfer exciton. In water, the charge-transfer exciton is strongly coupled to the H-bonding environment where the exciton is excited between H-bonded water molecules with a large spectral intensity. In regular ice, the spectral weight of the charge-transfer exciton is enhanced by a collective excitation occurring on proton-ordered water wires, whose spectral intensity scales with the ordering length of water wire. The spectral intensity and excitonic interaction strength reaches its maximum in ice XI, where the long-range ordering length yields the most pronounced spectral signal. Our findings suggest that water wires, which widely exist in important physiological and biological systems and other phases of ice, can be directly probed by this approach.},

  abstract     = {The spin- kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) is one of the most studied models in frustrated magnetism since it is a promising candidate to host exotic spin-liquid states. However, despite numerous studies using both analytical and numerical approaches, the nature of the ground state and low-energy excitations in this system remains elusive. This challenge is related to the difficulty in determining the spin gap in various calculations. We present the results of our investigation of the kagome AFM using the recently developed group equivariant convolutional neural networks—a novel machine learning technique for studying strongly frustrated models. This approach, combined with variational Monte Carlo method, introduces significant improvement of the achievable results’ accuracy for frustrated spin systems in comparison with approaches based on other neural-network architectures. Contrary to the results obtained previously with various methods, which predicted or Dirac spin-liquid states, our results strongly indicate that the ground state of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet is a spinon pair density wave that does not break time-reversal symmetry or any of the lattice symmetries. The state appears due to the spinon Cooper pairing instability close to two Dirac points in the spinon energy spectrum, and it resembles the pair density wave state studied previously in the context of underdoped cuprate superconductors in connection with the pseudogap phase. This state has significantly lower energy than the lowest-energy states found by the symmetric density matrix renormalization group calculations and other methods.},

  abstract     = {Detection and control of Andreev bound states (ABSs) localized at semiconductor-superconductor interfaces are essential for their use in quantum applications. Here we investigate the impact of ABSs on the supercurrent through a Josephson junction containing a quantum dot (QD). Additional normal-metal tunneling probes on both sides of the junction unveil the ABSs residing at the semiconductor-superconductor interfaces. Such knowledge provides an ingredient missing in previous studies, improving the connection between theory and experimental data. By varying the ABS energies using electrostatic gates, we show control of the switching current, with the ability to alter it by more than an order of magnitude. Finally, the large degree of ABS tunability allows us to realize a three-site Andreev molecule in which the central QD is screened by both ABSs. This system is studied simultaneously using both supercurrent and spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {The buckling of a soft elastic sample under growth or swelling has highlighted a new interest in materials science, morphogenesis, and biology or physiology. Indeed, the change of mass or volume is a common fact of any living species, and on a scale larger than the cell size, a macroscopic view can help to explain many features of common observation. Many morphologies of soft materials result from the accumulation of elastic compressive stress due to growth and thus from the minimization of a nonlinear elastic energy. The similarity between growth and compression of a piece of rubber has revived the instability formalism of nonlinear elastic samples in compression and, in particular, Biot’s instability. Here a modern treatment of this instability is presented in the light of complex analysis, and the richness of possible profiles that an interface can present under buckling, even if one restricts oneself to the two spatial dimensions, is demonstrated. Special attention is given to wrinkles, folds, and cusps, a surprising observation in swelling gels or clays, and a new threshold for crease patterns below the traditional Biot threshold is discovered. The standard techniques of complex analysis, nonlinear bifurcation theory, and path-independent integrals are revisited to highlight the role of physical parameters at the origin of the observed patterns below and above the Biot threshold.},

  abstract = {The traditional view from particle physics is that quantum-gravity effects should become detectable only at extremely high energies and small length scales. Owing to the significant technological challenges involved, there has been limited progress in identifying experimentally detectable effects that can be accessed in the foreseeable future. However, in recent decades the size and mass of quantum systems that can be controlled in the laboratory have reached unprecedented scales, enabled by advances in ground-state cooling and quantum-control techniques. Preparations of massive systems in quantum states pave the way for the explorations of a low-energy regime in which gravity can be both sourced and probed by quantum systems. Such approaches constitute an increasingly viable alternative to accelerator-based, laser-interferometric, torsion-balance, and cosmological tests of gravity. In this review an overview of proposals where massive quantum systems act as interfaces between quantum mechanics and gravity is provided. Conceptual difficulties in the theoretical description of quantum systems in the presence of gravity are discussed, tools for modeling massive quantum systems in the laboratory are reviewed, and an overview of the current state-of-the-art experimental landscape is provided. Proposals covered in this review include precision tests of gravity, tests of gravitationally induced wave-function collapse and decoherence, and gravity-mediated entanglement. The review concludes with an outlook and summary of the key questions raised.},
