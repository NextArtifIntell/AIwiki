  abstract     = {The advent of moiré platforms for engineered quantum matter has led to discoveries of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, with predictions for correlation-driven topological states based on electron crystallization. Here, we report an array of trivial and topological insulators formed in a moiré lattice of rhomobohedral pentalayer graphene (R5G). At a doping of one electron per moiré unit cell ( ), we see a correlated insulator with a Chern number that can be tuned between and by an electric displacement field. This is accompanied by a series of additional Chern insulators with originating from fractional fillings of the moiré lattice— , and —associated with the formation of moiré-driven topological electronic crystals. At the system exhibits an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect at zero magnetic field, but further develops hints of an incipient fractional Chern insulator in a modest field. Our results establish moiré R5G as a fertile platform for studying the competition and potential intertwining of integer and fractional Chern insulators.},

  abstract     = {Because of the lack of a net magnetic moment, antiferromagnets possess a unique robustness to external magnetic fields and are thus predicted to play an important role in future magnetic technologies. However, this robustness also makes them quite difficult to control, and the development of novel methods to manipulate these systems with external stimuli is a fundamental goal of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we report evidence for a metastable reorientation of the order parameter in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor triggered by an ultrafast quench of the equilibrium order via photoexcitation above the band gap. The metastable state forms less than 10 ps after the excitation pulse, and persists for longer than 150 ps before decaying to the ground state via thermal fluctuations. Importantly, this transition cannot be induced thermodynamically, and requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium. Broadly speaking, this phenomenology is ultimately the result of large magnetoelastic coupling in combination with a relatively low symmetry of the magnetic ground state. Since neither of these properties are particularly uncommon in magnetic materials, the observations presented here imply a generic path toward novel device technology enabled by ultrafast dynamics in antiferromagnets.},

  abstract     = {Glassy materials rapidly quenched from a liquid to a solid state upon flow cessation or cooling solidify in an out-of-equilibrium configuration, trapping residual stresses and retaining the memory of the processing conditions for very long times, which compromises their physical characterization and can adversely affect processing operations. Erasing the mechanical history encoded in disordered materials constitutes a great challenge. Here, we address this problem using experiments and particle dynamic simulations for the case of colloidal glasses made of soft particles densely packed at high volume fractions. We propose a conceptual framework that connects residual stresses, directional memory, and aging of colloidal glasses to the distribution of local shear stresses in the shearing plane. The mean value of the distribution corresponds to the macroscopic stress, the skewness carries information about directional memory, and the standard deviation is related to mechanical aging. Periodically training soft particle glasses near the yield point with a sequence of stress-controlled oscillations provides a fine-tuning of the particle stress distribution. Asymmetric shear stress distributions resulting from previous flow are transformed into symmetric distributions, thereby successfully erasing residual stresses and directional memory. The same methodology is successfully applied to colloidal and polymer gels with thixotropic properties, suggesting that it is general and may be extended to other classes of disordered materials.},

Here, we report two dark excitons in a model ferromagnetic material CrI 3 using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and show that they feature narrower linewidths compared to the bright excitons previously reported in this material.

  abstract     = {The disassembly of misfolded protein aggregates is a requirement for the proper functioning of cells. It has implications in multiple neuropathologies, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The active unbundling of fibrillar aggregates has recently been identified as a key rate-limiting step in the disassembly process. However, the nature of the underlying molecular mechanism remains an outstanding question. Here, we develop a coarse-grained computational approach from the atomistic structural information and show that the interactions of molecules tethered to fibrils lead to entropic forces consistent with the unbundling process observed in amyloid α-synuclein disaggregation by Hsp70. We uncover two main types of entropic effects, categorized as intraprotofilament and interprotofilament, which are differentially affected by the system parameters and conditions. Our results show that only highly efficient chaperone systems can overcome the free-energy cost of the lateral association between two protofilaments. Through the analysis of cryoelectron tomography and high-speed atomic force microscopy data, we find that the conditions for highly efficient entropic force generation are those typically achieved with cochaperone networks and ATP hydrolysis, which require energy expenditure but do not provide an enthalpic component to the separation force. We highlight the implications of these results for the design of targeted therapies for the underlying neuropathologies.},

In order to achieve low motional excitation during transport, we develop techniques to measure and mitigate the effect of the exposed dielectric surfaces used to deliver the integrated light to the ion. We also demonstrate simultaneous control of two ions in separate zones with low optical crosstalk and use this to perform simultaneous spectroscopy to correlate field noise between the two sites. Our work demonstrates the first transport and coherent multizone operations in integrated photonic ion trap systems, forming the basis for further scaling in the trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device architecture.},

In order to observe hydrodynamics effects, a 2D device where the current flow is as inhomogeneous as possible is desirable. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction, which is related to a transition from a noncollective to a collective regime of transport, behaves nonmonotonically with the magnetic field. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow and provide valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.},

Here we investigate static and dynamic magnetic properties of the cubic perovskite SrFeO 3 —a rare example of a centrosymmetric material hosting two types of topological spin textures: skyrmionlike and hedgehog-lattice phases. Our detailed magnetization and dilatometry measurements describe the domain selection processes and phase transitions in SrFeO 3 . Spin excitations are investigated using inelastic neutron scattering for all three zero-field phases. In the higher-temperature ordered phases, high-energy magnons increasingly lose coherence, so that spin fluctuations are dominated by a distinct quasielastic component at low energies. We anticipate that this could be generic to symmetric helimagnets in which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken by the magnetic order.},

In this paper, we report the first successful fabrication of a direct current superconducting quantum interference device (dc-SQUID) in the KTO system. The key device elements, superconducting weak links, are created by conductive atomic force microscope lithography, which can reversibly control the conductivity at the LAO/KTO (110) interface with nanoscale resolution. The periodic modulation of the SQUID critical current I c ( B ) with magnetic field corresponds well with our theoretical modeling, which reveals a large kinetic inductance of the superconducting two-dimensional electron gas in KTO. The kinetic inductance of the SQUID is tunable by electrical gating from the back, due to the large dielectric constant of KTO. The demonstration of weak links and SQUIDs in KTO broadens the scope for exploring the underlying physics of KTO superconductivity, including the role of spin-orbit coupling, pairing symmetry, and inhomogeneity. It also promotes KTO as a versatile platform for a growing family of quantum devices, which could be applicable in the realm of quantum computing and information.},

In Mott insulators, the primary candidates for heat carriers are spins and phonons; which of these candidates dominates the thermal conductivity is a persistent issue. Typically, phonons dominate the longitudinal thermal conductivity while the thermal Hall effect (THE) is primarily associated with spins, requiring time-reversal symmetry breaking. The coupling between phonons and spins usually depends on spin-orbit interactions and is relatively weak. Here, we propose a new mechanism for this coupling and the associated THE: the skew scattering of phonons via spin fluctuations by the scalar spin chirality. This coupling does not require spin-orbit interactions and is ubiquitous in Mott insulators, leading to a thermal Hall angle on the order of 10 − 3 to 10 − 2 . Based on this mechanism, we investigate the THE in YMnO 3 with a trimerized triangular lattice where the THE beyond spins was recognized, and we predict the THE in the kagome and square lattices.},

Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states, but not both. Here, we achieve the first coexistence of thermalization and memory in a quantum system, where we use both Rydberg blockade and facilitation in an atom array to engineer a fragmentation of the Hilbert space into exponentially many disjointed subspaces. We find that the kinetically constrained system yields quantum many-body scars arising from the class of initial states, which generalizes beyond the scars previously reported in other quantum systems. When bringing multiple long-range interactions into resonance, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states belonging to different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work sheds light on a subtle aspect of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the long-standing tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.},

In this work, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate an unexpected rotational symmetry breaking in Landau levels formed in the unusual floating surface band of ZrSiS. We visualize a ubiquitous splitting of Landau levels into valley-polarized sublevels. We demonstrate methods to measure valley-selective Landau level spectroscopy, to infer unknown Landau level indices, and to precisely measure each valley’s Berry phase in a way that is agnostic to the band structure and topology of the system. These techniques allow us to measure each valley’s low-energy dispersion and infer a rigid valley-dependent contribution to the band energies. Ruling out spontaneous symmetry breaking by establishing the sample dependence of this valley splitting, we explain the effect in terms of residual strain. A quantitative estimate indicates that uniaxial strain can be measured to a precision of . The extreme valley polarization of the Landau levels results from as little as approximately 0.1% strain, and this suggests avenues for manipulation using deliberate strain engineering.},

Combining linear and circular dichroism in soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission (SX-ARPES) with first-principles theory, we image the winding of atomic orbital angular momentum, thereby revealing—and determining the location of—lines of vorticity in full 3D momentum space. We determine the core of the orbital angular momentum vortex to host an almost movable, twofold, spin-degenerate Weyl nodal line, a topological feature predicted to occur in certain nonsymmorphic crystals. These results establish bimodal dichroism in SX-ARPES as a robust approach to trace 3D orbital textures.

Despite their central role in quantum information, their relations to quantum chaotic evolution and, in particular, to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) are still largely debated issues. This work provides a bridge between the latter and designs through free probability theory. First, by introducing the more general notion of -freeness, we show that it can be used as an alternative probe to designs. In turn, free probability theory comes with several tools, useful, for instance, for the calculation of mixed moments or the so-called -fold quantum channels. Our second result is the connection to quantum dynamics. Quantum ergodicity and, correspondingly, ETH apply to a restricted class of physical observables, as already discussed in the literature. In this spirit, we show that unitary evolution with generic Hamiltonians always leads to freeness at sufficiently long times but only when the operators considered are restricted within the ETH class. Our results provide a direct link between unitary designs, quantum chaos, and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and shed new light on the universality of late-time quantum dynamics.},

The vibrational anomalies in glass at low temperatures are recovered in the stable solid limit, and floppy modes lacking restoring forces are predicted in unstable states below the jamming transition. Near the unjamming transition, the speed of sound v 0 ⊥ vanishes with ∝ − ε , where ε denotes the distance from the critical point. Additionally, the density of states develops a plateau, independent of ε above a frequency ω * which vanishes at the transition, ω * ∝ | ε | . We identify a characteristic length scale in the unjammed phase, λ − ⊥ ∝ 1 / ε , indicating the distance over which injected momentum remains correlated. We confirm the theoretical predictions with numerical solutions of a scalar ERM model, demonstrating overall good qualitative and partly quantitative agreement.},

  abstract     = {Atomic nuclei exhibit multiple energy scales ranging from hundreds of MeV in binding energies to fractions of an MeV for low-lying collective excitations. As the limits of nuclear binding are approached near the neutron and proton drip lines, traditional shell structure starts to melt with an onset of deformation and an emergence of coexisting shapes. It is a long-standing challenge to describe this multiscale physics starting from nuclear forces with roots in quantum chromodynamics. Here, we achieve this within a unified and nonperturbative quantum many-body framework that captures both short- and long-range correlations starting from modern nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces from chiral effective field theory. The short-range (dynamic) correlations which account for the bulk of the binding energy are included within a symmetry-breaking framework, while long-range (static) correlations (and fine details about the collective structure) are included by employing symmetry projection techniques. Our calculations accurately reproduce—within theoretical error bars—available experimental data for low-lying collective states and the electromagnetic quadrupole transitions in Ne 20 − 30 . In addition, we reveal coexisting spherical and deformed shapes in Ne 30 , which indicates the breakdown of the magic neutron number N = 20 as the key nucleus O 28 is approached, and we predict that the drip line nuclei Ne 32 , 34 are strongly deformed and collective. By developing reduced-order models for symmetry-projected states, we perform a global sensitivity analysis and find that the subleading singlet S -wave contact and a pion-nucleon coupling strongly impact nuclear deformation in chiral effective field theory. The techniques developed in this work clarify how microscopic nuclear forces generate the multiscale physics of nuclei spanning collective phenomena as well as short-range correlations and allow one to capture emergent and dynamical phenomena in finite fermion systems such as atom clusters, molecules, and atomic nuclei.},

  abstract     = {A vortex is a topological defect in the superconducting condensate when a magnetic field is applied to a type-II superconductor, as elucidated by the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Because of the confinement of the quasiparticles by a vortex, it exhibits a circular-shaped pattern of bound states with discrete energy levels, as predicted by the Caroli–de Gennes–Matricon theory in 1964. Here, however, we report a completely new type of vortex pattern which is necklacelike in an iron-based superconductor KCa 2 Fe 4 As 4 F 2 . Our theoretical analysis shows that this necklacelike vortex pattern arises primarily from selective off-shell interference between vortex bound states of opposite angular momenta in the presence of rotational symmetry breaking due to disorders. This fascinating effect can be observed in a system with a small Fermi energy and wave vector, conditions fortuitously met in our samples. Our results not only disclose a novel vortex structure, but also unravel a completely new quantum phenomenon in the superconducting condensate.},

While the early phase of pattern formation can be understood on the basis of linear stability analyses, the longtime dynamics can only be described by accounting for the interactions between the excitations generated by the drive. Here, we observe the stabilization of square patterns in an interaction-driven, two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. These patterns emerge due to inherent high-order processes that become relevant in the regime of large phonon occupations. Theoretically, this can be understood as the emergence of a stable fixed point of coupled nonlinear amplitude equations, which include phonon-phonon interactions. We experimentally probe the predicted flows toward such a stable fixed point, as well as repulsion from a saddle fixed point, using the experimental control unique to quantum gases.},

In this work, we propose a way to realize a U(1) quantum spin liquid in three spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of U(1) gauge theory in a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of “magnetic” monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of “electric” charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.},

  abstract     = {Quantum key distribution offers a promising avenue for establishing secure communication networks. However, its performance is significantly hampered by the conventional two-level information carriers (i.e., qubits) due to their limited information capacity and noise resilience. A fundamental approach to overcoming these limitations involves the adoption of high-dimensional qudits. Practical qudit platforms require robust propagation, outstanding controllability, and extreme compactness, to which integrated photonics provides a promising solution. Here, we achieved, for the first time, microlaser-enabled high-dimensional quantum communication through leveraging spin-orbit photon qudits, where the dynamical generation and manipulation of these multi-degrees-of-freedom complex quantum state are realized by a non-Hermitian-physics-driven integrated microlaser quantum transmitter. Such a microlaser photon manipulation, as a novel route towards high-dimensional quantum state generation, promises high energy efficiency, along with fast, compact, and precise qudit state reconfigurability. The four spin-orbit eigenstates emitted by the microlaser possess the same spatial-temporal structures, ensuring homogeneity between all qudit states used for key distribution, which effectively eliminates propagation dephasing and walk-off problems, thereby delivering the high-dimensional spin-orbit secret key generation to construct a robust quantum link. The demonstrated long-term system stability showcases the practical potential of the microlaser quantum transmitter, providing a critical step towards compact, high-information-capacity quantum communication networks.},

However, for standard light sources generating intense laser pulses carrying quadrillions of photons in a coherent state, the classical description of light during intense laser-matter interaction has been expected to be adequate. Here, we show how nonlinear optical response of matter can be controlled to generate dramatic deviations from this standard picture, including generation of several squeezed and entangled harmonics of the incident laser light. In particular, such nontrivial quantum states of harmonics are generated as soon as one of the harmonics induces a transition between different laser-dressed states of the material system. Such transitions generate an entangled light-matter wave function, which can generate quantum states of harmonics even in the absence of a quantum driving field or material correlations. In turn, entanglement of the material system with a single harmonic generates and controls entanglement between different harmonics. Hence, nonlinear media that are near resonant with at least one of the harmonics appear to be quite attractive for controlled generation of massively entangled quantum states of light. Our analysis opens remarkable opportunities at the interface of attosecond physics and quantum optics, with implications for quantum information science.},

While it may proceed through the binding of perfectly matched, puzzle-piece-like particles, many other instances involve ill-fitting particles that must deform to fit together. These include some pathological proteins, which have a known propensity to form fibrous aggregates. Despite this observation, the general relationship between the individual characteristics of the particles and the overall structure of the aggregate is not understood. To elucidate it, we analytically and numerically study the self-assembly of two-dimensional, deformable ill-fitting particles. We find that moderately sticky particles tend to form equilibrium self-limited aggregates whose size is set by an elastic boundary layer associated with collective deformations that may extend over many particles. Particles with a soft internal deformation mode thus give rise to large aggregates. In addition, when the particles are incompressible, their aggregates tend to be anisotropic and fiberlike. Our results are preserved in a more complex particle model with randomly chosen elastic properties. This indicates that generic proteinlike characteristics such as allostery and incompressibility could favor the formation of fibers in protein aggregation, and suggests design principles for artificial self-assembling structures.},

  abstract     = {Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special nonequilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally symmetric limit . First, we numerically establish that, despite the fact that spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal , the towers of energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as is increased and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor nonlinearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analytically solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for (with ). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for an arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g., near dynamical critical points or in the presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a by-product, we find a predictive criterion for the presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for , beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.},
