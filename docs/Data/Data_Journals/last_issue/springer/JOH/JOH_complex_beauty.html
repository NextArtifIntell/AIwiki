  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a lot-sizing and scheduling problem apparent in the food industry that stemmed originally from the Brazilian meat production sector. More specifically, we consider a production environment in which various production lines share a set of scarce production resources. Therefore, only a subset of the existing production lines can simultaneously operate in each period under the limitations of the availability of resources. Moreover, we consider sequence-dependent setup times and costs, significant inventory holding costs, backlogging, and perishable products. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model, and we propose four Lagrangian-based heuristics to find high-quality solutions for challenging instances. A computational study shows that proposed approaches are very competitive in solving the problem, outperforming methods already established in the literature.},

Its objective is to find the best schedule for activities across multiple projects that can be executed in different modes. The schedule must consider shared resource availability and satisfy precedence and time constraints. To tackle this problem, we propose a hybrid approach that combines constraint programming (CP) with meta-heuristic algorithms. We introduce and assess a CP model that incorporates all MMRCMPSP constraints. By leveraging the strengths of CP and meta-heuristics, our approach yields new upper bounds for various MMRCMPSP benchmark instances. Additionally, we evaluate our method using existing benchmark instances for single-project scheduling problems with multiple modes and provide improved solutions for many of them.},

  abstract     = {High population density and commercial-activity density in urban areas make land use for urban logistics systems even more challenging. Herein, a concept named sharing-curbside satellite (SS) is involved in two-echelon city logistics systems. Traditional vans are deployed in the 1st-echelon network, whereas ground-based robots are employed in the 2nd-echelon network. As a type of nondedicated satellites, the SS shares curbside spaces with the local traffic flow, and each SS can have multiple time windows for direct transshipment between vans and robots. The SS can provide a new mode for urban deliveries through temporary and nondedicated satellites at the neighborhood level. In this study, the two-echelon van-robot routing problem with SSs (2ERP-SS) is defined. The SS synchronization involves vans being used as part of SSs, each SS has multiple time windows, cargoes are transshipped directly between vans and robots, and the available transshipment capacity decreases over time. We develop a mixed-integer linear programming model. We provide a large neighborhood search (LNS) combined with a beam search algorithm, and employ an adaptive LNS (ALNS) for comparison. The effectiveness of the mathematical formulation and heuristics are evaluated through computational experiments, and practical management insights are elucidated.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the dynamic multi-objective bin packing problem, a combinatorial optimization problem within the cutting/packing problems family. A solution to this problem involves packing cooling cookies into boxes while following a specific production process. In such a case, items, each with its own capacity, arrive in batches at racks. The objective is to optimize (i) the number of boxes used, (ii) the average initial heat associated with each box, and (iii) the maximum time taken to move all boxes to the storefront. This problem is addressed through an adaptive multi-objective scatter search applied to a special dynamic bin packing problem. The method begins by constructing an initial Pareto front set, specifically, the initial reference set containing diversified solutions based on the three objective functions related to the studied problem. The subsequent stages of the method operate in three collaborative phases: (i) improving the reference set by optimizing a highlighted objective function, (ii) refining the final reference set by prioritizing the optimization of average initial heat, and (iii) addressing the objective related to the maximum time to establish the final solution. Hence, to facilitate the transition between the aforementioned three phases, a hybridization between the solution combination method and the reference update method is introduced. Finally, the proposed method’s performance is evaluated using benchmark and newly generated instances and compared with recent methods. The study includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses. To identify the best-performing method among those tested, three statistical tests are conducted: the Student’s t-test, the Sign test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Additionally, performance metrics such as the $$\varepsilon $$ -test, the binary coverage measure, and the net front contribution indicator are used for evaluation. The results achieved by the proposed method surpass those published in the literature, highlighting the method’s strength and effectiveness, and establishing it as a competitive solution for the dynamic multi-objective bin-packing problem.},

  abstract     = {We study a resource allocation problem featuring specific constraints, called exclusivity constraints, in addition to regular compatibility constraints. Resources are to be allocated to independent modules, each having a list of compatible resources. A resource can be allocated to several modules. However, some modules exhibit exclusivity constraints, requiring each of them to be allocated to one dedicated compatible resource, not shared with any other module. Such a resource allocation problem arises in the deployment of simulation modules on computational resources in a distributed simulation platform, where the simulation requester may require some modules to be allocated to dedicated resources for a better soft real-time execution, or for instrumentation purposes. In this paper, we introduce the problem of resource allocation with compatibility and exclusivity constraints and show it reduces to the list-coloring problem in a threshold graph. We deduce that our problem is NP-complete in the general case, while it can be solved in polynomial time, in two special cases. We propose a heuristic backtracking algorithm enhanced by pruning rules and exploiting the subproblems’ special structure. Compared to four list coloring heuristics adapted to our problem, our heuristic algorithm can be considered as the method of choice to find high-quality solutions in short computing times.},

  abstract     = {The flexible periodic vehicle routing problem (FPVRP) is an extension of the classic VRP in which customers are visited periodically in the course of a given time horizon. Periodicity and flexibility in providing services are two main features of the FPVRP, which introduce new challenges in solving this problem. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one single-solution-based algorithm in the literature for solving the FPVRP. In this paper, another technique called the MA-FPVRP is proposed for tackling this problem. Our population-based approach is a memetic algorithm made up of two main components: a genetic procedure that aims to find a suitable sequence of visits for each route, and a local search procedure consisting of four moves whose prime goal is to guide the search toward the promising areas. Considering 45 standard benchmark instances with unknown optimal solutions, the MA-FPVRP outperforms the preceding method in terms of both the solution quality and execution time. Using this evolutionary scheme, the average relative percent deviation (RPD) to the best-known solution values decreases from 0.52% to 0.15%, and the average execution time improves by approximately 31%. For all 10 large instances of the FPVRP, new best results are found using our algorithm. Considering the remaining 35 small and medium-size instances, our approach is superior to the previous method in terms of the solution quality, and it is more than two times faster. Besides, using the MA-FPVRP, new best solutions are obtained for 5 out of these 35 instances.},

Thanks to developments in automation and robotic technologies, LSPs have now the opportunity to enhance their operations through the deployment of autonomous delivery solutions like drones and delivery robots. This paper investigates a practical delivery system to integrate these emerging technologies simultaneously into conventional van-only delivery system. Additionally, the effects of various assistant characteristics on operations are examined through broader assumptions. We introduce a mathematical model aiming to minimize delivery makespan and explore various valid inequalities to mitigate its complexity. A new hybrid metaheuristic algorithm combining genetic algorithm and large neighborhood search algorithm is also proposed for large scale instances. A three-layer coding and encoding method is also introduced for genetic algorithm to manage the complex structure of the problem. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of valid inequalities and the algorithm. The sensitivity analyses provide comparisons of various delivery configurations and offer valuable insights for the logistics industry to integrate these innovative delivery solutions into their daily operations. In our experiments, using a single drone reduces total delivery times by up to 23.57%, while a single robot contributes to a 37.19% improvement in the objective. The heterogeneous configuration offers a substantial 49.71% improvement compared to using only vans for deliveries.},

  abstract     = {Classification of imbalanced multi-class data is still so far one of the most challenging issues in machine learning and data mining. This task becomes more serious when classes containing fewer instances are located in overlapping regions. Several approaches have been proposed through the literature to deal with these two issues such as the use of decomposition, the design of ensembles, the employment of misclassification costs, and the development of ad-hoc strategies. Despite these efforts, the number of existing works dealing with the imbalance in multi-class data is much reduced compared to the case of binary classification. Moreover, existing approaches still suffer from many limits. These limitations include difficulties in handling imbalances across multiple classes, challenges in adapting sampling techniques, limitations of certain classifiers, the need for specialized evaluation metrics, the complexity of data representation, and increased computational costs. Motivated by these observations, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary induction approach that evolves a population of NLM-DTs (Non-Linear Multivariate Decision Trees) using the $$\theta $$ -NSGA-III ( $$\theta $$ -Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III) as a search engine. The resulting algorithm is termed EMO-NLM-DT (Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization of NLM-DTs) and is designed to optimize the construction of NLM-DTs for imbalanced multi-class data classification by simultaneously maximizing both the Macro-Average-Precision and the Macro-Average-Recall as two possibly conflicting objectives. The choice of these two measures as objective functions is motivated by a recent study on the appropriateness of performance metrics for imbalanced data classification, which suggests that the mAURPC (mean Area Under Recall Precision Curve) satisfies all necessary conditions for imbalanced multi-class classification. Moreover, the NLM-DT adoption as a baseline classifier to be optimized allows the generation non-linear hyperplanes that are well-adapted to the classes ‘boundaries’ geometrical shapes. The statistical analysis of the comparative experimental results on more than twenty imbalanced multi-class data sets reveals the outperformance of EMO-NLM-DT in building NLM-DTs that are highly effective in classifying imbalanced multi-class data compared to seven relevant and recent state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The Block Relocation Problem (BRP), also known as the Container Relocation Problem, is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem in block stacking systems and has many applications in real-world scenarios such as logistics and manufacturing industry. The BRP is about finding the optimal way to retrieve blocks from a storage area with the objective of minimizing the number of relocations. The BRPs have been studied for a long time, and have been solved primarily using conventional optimization techniques, including mathematical programming models, as well as both exact and heuristic algorithms. For the first time, this paper tackles the problem using a reinforcement learning method. We focus on one of the major variants of the BRP—the restricted BRP with duplicate priorities (RBRP-dup). We first model the RBRP-dup as a Markov decision process and then propose a Q-learning-based algorithm to solve the problem. The Q-learning-based algorithm contains two phases. In the learning phase, two innovative mechanisms: an optimal rule-integrated behaviour policy and a heuristic-based dynamic initialization method, are incorporated into the Q-learning model to reduce the size of the state-action space and accelerate convergence. In the optimization phase, the insights obtained in the learning phase are combined with a heuristic algorithm to improve decision-making. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated against the state-of-the-art exact algorithm and a commonly used heuristic algorithm based on benchmark instances from the literature. The computational experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method regarding solution quality in large and complex instances.},

We present an algorithm to address a major challenge, the slitting problem, for a specific Spanish company. This problem arises when large steel coils need to be cut into smaller strips. Given the highly heterogeneous stock (coils come from previous operations), selecting the most suitable coils and defining the cutting patterns become very complicated due to operational and customer constraints. The company aims to reduce the leftovers and increase the service level (the difference between the weight requested by the customer and the weight supplied). The algorithm is currently in production and was validated using the company’s data and compared with an exact model. Results significantly improved the company’s operations, achieving a 50% reduction in leftovers and a much better service level in minutes, as opposed to the hours the company previously required. Although there are Mixed Integer Linear Optimization models that provide an optimal solution in small cases, they are not a viable alternative for the company because they require excessive computational time (even, in some cases, to obtain feasible solutions) and use overly expensive commercial solvers.},

Additionally, the proposed model assumes that a setup is necessary for the cutting machine when switching patterns. The contribution of this paper includes the proposition of an integer mathematical programming model and a matheuristic solution approach for two variants of the MPCSPDDS, employing column generation, a round-up heuristic, and the local branching matheuristic. Computational experiments show that our proposed solution method consistently yields, on average, high-quality feasible solutions compared to employing column generation and solving the problem with the generated columns using the CPLEX solver while maintaining a low computational cost.},

  abstract     = {The Burrows–Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a string transformation technique widely used in areas such as bioinformatics and file compression. Many applications combine a run-length encoding (RLE) with the BWT in a way which preserves the ability to query the compressed data efficiently. However, these methods may not take full advantage of the compressibility of the BWT as they do not modify the alphabet ordering for the sorting step embedded in computing the BWT. Indeed, any such alteration of the alphabet ordering can have a considerable impact on the output of the BWT, in particular on the number of runs. For an alphabet $$\Sigma $$ containing $$\sigma $$ characters, the space of all alphabet orderings is of size $$\sigma !$$ . While for small alphabets an exhaustive investigation is possible, finding the optimal ordering for larger alphabets is not feasible. Therefore, there is a need for a more informed search strategy than brute-force sampling the entire space, which motivates a new heuristic approach. In this paper, we explore the non-trivial cases for the problem of minimizing the size of a run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) via selecting a new ordering for the alphabet. We show that random sampling of the space of alphabet orderings usually gives sub-optimal orderings for compression and that a local search strategy can provide a large improvement in relatively few steps. We also inspect a selection of initial alphabet orderings, including ASCII, letter appearance, and letter frequency. While this alphabet ordering problem is computationally hard we demonstrate gain in compressibility.},

  abstract     = {Metaheuristic algorithms have proven capable as general-purpose algorithms for solving simulation optimization problems. Researchers and practitioners often compare different metaheuristic algorithms by examining one or more measures that are derived through empirical analysis. This paper presents a single measure that can be used to empirically compare different metaheuristic algorithms for optimization problems. This measure incorporates both the effectiveness and efficiency of the metaheuristic algorithm, which is especially important in simulation optimization applications because the number of simulation runs available to the analyst (i.e., the run budget) can vary significantly with each simulation study. Therefore, the trade-off between the effectiveness and efficiency of a metaheuristic algorithm must be examined. This single measure is especially useful for multi-objective optimization problems; however, determining this measure is non-trivial for two or more objective functions. Additional details for calculating this measure for multi-objective optimization problems are provided as well as a procedure for comparing two or more metaheuristic algorithms. Finally, computational results are presented and analyzed to compare the performance of metaheuristic algorithms using knapsack problems, pure binary integer programs, traveling salesman problems, and the average results obtained across a diverse set of optimization problems that include simulation and multi-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In feature selection, the increasing of the dimensionality and the complexity of feature interactions make the problem challenging. Furthermore, searching for an optimal subset of features from a high-dimensional feature space is known to be an $$\mathcal{N}\mathcal{P}$$ -hard problem. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the search algorithm, feature grouping has emerged as a way to reduce the search space by clustering features according to a measure. In this work we propose to reduce the search space by applying a greedy algorithm, called Multivariate Greedy Predominant Groups Generator (MGPGG). MGPGG extends the idea of the Greedy Predominant Groups Generator (GPGG) algorithm by taking into account feature interaction among three or more features. For this purpose, MGPGG uses the Multivariate Symmetrical Uncertainty (MSU) to group features that share information about the class label. We also propose a Scatter Search strategy that integrates MGPGG to find small subsets of features with high predictive power. The proposed algorithm, called Multivariate Predominant Group-based Scatter Search (MPGSS), is tested on high-dimensional data from biomedical and text-mining fields. The proposal is compared with state-of-the-art feature selection strategies. Results show that MPGSS is competitive since it is capable of finding small subsets of features while keeping high predictive classification models.},

  abstract     = {Roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) ships offer distinct advantages in the maritime industry when it comes to transporting wheeled cargos and super-large vehicles. As the scale of RoRo fleets continues to grow, RoRo shipping companies face the challenge of efficiently organizing multiple ships to meet transportation demands across various regions, ensuring order fulfillment, and minimizing costs. In light of these challenges, we introduced and explored the multi-vessel RoRo ship scheduling, routing and stowage problem (m-RSRSSP), and proposed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address this problem. Compared with previous studies, this paper enriches fleet&#39;s decision-making and address scenarios where multiple cargos are considered at one port on the basis of integrating ship scheduling, routing and stowage problem of ro-ro ship, which is better aligned with the requirements of certain practical scenarios. Given the intricate nature of this model, we developed a heuristic algorithm rooted in tabu search, incorporating a nested greedy approach. Furthermore, we presented a case study involving deep-sea RoRo transportation between Northeast Asia and Europe. The experimental results validate the efficiency and reliability of the proposed heuristic algorithm in solving large-scale problems, and provide valuable strategies for the formulation of the RoRo fleet operation schemes.},

  abstract     = {The partial set covering problem (PSCP) is a significant combinatorial optimization problem that finds applications in numerous real-world scenarios. The objective of PSCP is to encompass a minimum number of subsets while ensuring the coverage of at least n elements. Due to its NP-hard nature, solving large-scale PSCP efficiently remains a critical issue in computational intelligence. To effectively tackle this challenge, we delve into a population-based approach that incorporates a modified tabu search, thereby striking a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. To further enhance its efficacy, we employ the multiple path-relinking strategy and the fix-and-optimize process. Finally, the dynamic resource allocation scheme is utilized to save computing efforts. Comparative experiments of the proposed algorithm were conducted against three state-of-the-art competitors, across two distinct categories, encompassing 150 instances. The results significantly underscore the profound effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, as evidenced by the updating of 67 best-known solutions. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the key components inherent to the algorithm, shedding light on their respective influences on the whole performance.},
