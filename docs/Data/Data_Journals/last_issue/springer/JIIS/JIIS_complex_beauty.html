These clusters summarize and represent the semantic contents of the documents for better document interpretation. In this work, we present a light approach able to learn topic representations in a Self-Supervised fashion. More specifically, we propose a lightweight and scalable architecture using a seed-word driven approach to simultaneously co-learn a representation from a document and its corresponding word embeddings. The results obtained on a variety of datasets of different sizes and natures show that our model is capable of extracting meaningful topics. Furthermore, our experiments on five benchmark datasets illustrate that our model outperforms both traditional and neural topic modelling baseline models in terms of different coherence and clustering accuracy measures.},

  abstract     = {Sampling high-quality negative samples and training together with positive samples can help improve the performance and generalization ability of the recommendation model. However, traditional negative sampling methods, such as random sampling or heuristic rules, often fail to adequately capture negative samples that reflect the user’s true taste. To provide interpretability and diversity of negative samples, we propose a collaborative knowledge graph-based reinforcement negative sampling recommendation model called KGRec-RNS that formalizes the problem of finding negative signals into a Markov decision process (MDP). Firstly, user interaction data and external knowledge are integrated into a collaborative Bipartite-Knowledge graph (BKG) as MDP context information environment. Then, an Actor based sampler including graph learning module, neighbor attention module and neighbor pruning module is designed. The graph learning module utilizes graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to extract high-order information of each node, the neighbor attention module is adopted to distinguish the influence of different nodes, and the user conditional action pruning strategy is integrated. Thus, negative samples with interpretability can be screened out. Finally, a Critic based recommender was designed to evaluate the current state and the action reward to guide the policy update of the Actor network, thereby matching high-quality negative samples with positive samples. The experimental results on three real datasets demonstrate that our KGRec-RNS has significant advantages in providing more accurate and diverse recommendations.},

  abstract     = {The cold-start problem is a long-standing problem in recommender systems, i.e., lack of historical interaction information hinders effective recommendations for new users and items. Existing methods typically incorporate attribute information of users and items to address the strict cold-start problem. Most existing recommendation methods overlook the sparsity of user attributes in cold start recommendation systems. In this paper, we develop a novel framework, Graph Attention Networks with Adaptive Neighbor Graph Aggregation for cold-start Recommendation (A-GAR), which utilizes the user/item relationship information in cold-start recommendation systems to alleviate the sparsity of attributes. we can achieve more accurate recommendations in cold-start scenarios by fully exploring the complex relations between users/items using graph structures. Specifically, to learn the complex relationships between user/item attributes, we utilize SENet (Squeeze and Excitation Network) and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) networks to adaptively fuse the embeddings of user/item and their second-order interaction vectors, achieving high-order feature aggregation. To address the issue of lacking preference information in cold-start recommendations, we extend the variational autoencoder to reconstruct missing user preferences (item characteristics) from higher-order attribute features of users/items. In order to learn the potential semantic relationships of nodes in the neighbor graph structure, an attribute graph attention network is used to aggregate the neighbor information of users and the interaction information between neighbors. In this way, the high-order relationships between nodes and the potential semantics of adjacent graphs can be fully explored. Extensive experiments on three real-word datasets with various cold-start scenarios demonstrate that A-GAR yields significant improvements for strict cold-start recommendations.},

These systems face challenges associated with data privacy constraints and protection regulations, impeding the sharing of user data for model improvement. To address the issue of data silos, federated learning emerges as a viable solution. However, difficulties arise due to the non-independent and non-identically distributed nature of data across different platforms, affecting performance. Furthermore, conventional federated learning often overlooks individual differences among stakeholders. In response to these challenges, we propose a pioneering cross-platform federated group recommendation system named FedGR. FedGR integrates hypergraph convolution, attention aggregation, and fully connected fusion components with federated learning to ensure exceptional model performance while preserving the confidentiality of private data. Additionally, we introduce a novel federated model aggregation strategy that prioritizes models with high training effectiveness, thereby improving overall model performance. To address individual differences, we design a temporal personalization update strategy for updating item representations, allowing local models to focus more on their individual characteristics. To evaluate FedGR, we apply our approach to three real-world datasets, demonstrating the robust capabilities of our cross-platform group recommendation system.},

However, these methods often overlook global semantic information. In contrast, traditional graph learning methods focus solely on structured information from text to graph, neglecting the hidden local information within the syntactic structure of the text. When combined, these approaches may introduce new noise and training biases. To tackle these challenges, we introduce DA-BAG, a novel approach that co-trains BERT and graph convolution models. Utilizing a self-domain adversarial training method on a single dataset, DA-BAG extracts multi-domain distribution features across multiple models, enabling self-adversarial domain adaptation training without the need for additional data, thereby enhancing model generalization and robustness. Furthermore, by incorporating an attention mechanism in multiple models, DA-BAG effectively combines the structural semantics of the graph with the token-level semantics of the pre-trained model, leveraging hidden information within the text’s syntactic structure. Additionally, a sequential multi-layer graph convolutional neural(GCN) connection structure based on a residual pre-activation variant is employed to stabilize the feature distribution of graph data and adjust the graph data structure accordingly. Extensive evaluations on 5 datasets(20NG, R8, R52, Ohsumed, MR) demonstrate that DA-BAG achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of datasets.},

Music metadata such as artists, albums, genres, and tags are included in the content information, along with context data incorporating user behaviour such as sessions, listening logs, and music playing sequences. By representing the music data as a graph, we can effectively capture the intricate relationships between songs and users. To capture users’ music preferences, we analyse their interactions with songs within the sessions. We incorporate content-based item embeddings for newly added items, enabling personalized recommendations for new songs based on their characteristics and similarities to the songs listened by users in the past. Specifically, we examined the proposed model on three distinct datasets, and the experimental outcomes show its efficacy in predicting music ratings for new songs. Compared to other baseline methods, the CASRM model achieves superior performance in providing accurate and diverse music recommendations in cold-start scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Bipolar disorder is a disorder in which a person expresses manic and depressed emotions repeatedly. Diagnosing bipolar disorder accurately can be difficult because other mood disorders or even regular mood changes may have similar symptoms. Therefore, psychiatrists need to spend a long time observing and interviewing clients to make the diagnosis. Recent studies have trained machine learning models for detecting bipolar disorder on social media. However, most of these studies focused on increasing the accuracy of the model without explaining the classification results. Although the posts of a bipolar disorder user can be observed manually, doing so is not practical since a user can have many posts which may not depict any signs of bipolar disorder. Without any explanations, the trustworthiness of the model decreases. We propose a deep learning model that not only detects and classifies bipolar disorder users but also explains how the model generates the classification results. The posts are first grouped using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a method commonly used to classify the topic of a text. These groups are then input into the model, and attention mechanisms are utilized to determine which groups have more attention weights and are considered more heavily. Finally, an explanation of the classification results is obtained by visualizing the attention weights. Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the explanations generated through our proposed model. Our model is also compared to other models, achieving the best performance with an F1-Score of 0.92.},

Indeed, a reliable prediction can imply several benefits, by allowing for an improved planning of the model execution, a better allocation of available resources, and the identification of possible anomalies. However, to make such predictions is usually hard, since there is a scarcity of datasets that benchmark the existing meteorological simulation models. In this work, we focus on the runtime predictions of the execution of the COSMO (COnsortium for SMall-scale MOdeling) weather forecasting model used at the Hydro-Meteo-Climate Structure of the Regional Agency for the Environment and Energy Prevention Emilia-Romagna. We show how a plethora of Machine Learning approaches can obtain accurate runtime predictions of this complex model, by designing a new well-defined benchmark for this application task. Indeed, our contribution is twofold: 1) the creation of a large public dataset reporting the runtime of COSMO run under a variety of different configurations; 2) a comparative study of ML models, which greatly outperform the current state-of-practice used by the domain experts. This data collection represents an essential initial benchmark for this application field, and a useful resource for analyzing the model performance: better accuracy in runtime predictions could help facility owners to improve job scheduling and resource allocation of the entire system; while for a final user, a posteriori analysis could help to identify anomalous runs.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-Based Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), a critical sub-task of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), has received extensive attention in recent years. ASTE aims to extract structured sentiment triples from texts, with most existing studies focusing on designing new strategic frameworks. Nonetheless, these methods often overlook the complex characteristics of linguistic expression and the deeper semantic nuances, leading to deficiencies in extracting the semantic representations of triples and effectively utilizing syntactic relationships in texts. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a span-based semantic and syntactic Dual-Enhanced model that deeply integrates rich syntactic information, such as part-of-speech tagging, constituent syntax, and dependency syntax structures. Specifically, we designed a semantic encoder and a syntactic encoder to capture the semantic-syntactic information closely related to the sentence’s underlying intent. Through a Feature Interaction Module, we effectively integrate information across different dimensions and promote a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between aspects and opinions. We also adopted a span-based tagging scheme that generates more precise aspect sentiment triple extractions by exploring cross-level information and constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets derived from the SemEval challenge prove that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines.},

  abstract     = {Temporal graph entity alignment aims at finding the equivalent entity pairs across different temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). Primarily methods mainly utilize a time-aware and relationship-aware approach to embed and align. However, the existence of long-tail entities in TKGs still restricts the accuracy of alignment, as the limited neighborhood information may restrict the available neighborhood information for obtaining high-quality embeddings, and hence would impact the efficiency of entity alignment in representation space. Moreover, most previous researches are supervised, with heavy dependence on seed labels for alignment, restricting their applicability in scenarios with limited resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Temporal Knowledge Completion enhanced Self-supervised Entity Alignment (TSEA). We argue that, with high-quality embeddings, the entities would be aligned in a self-supervised manner. To this end, TSEA is constituted of two modules: A graph completion module to predict the missing links for the long-tailed entities. With the improved graph, TSEA further incorporates a self-supervised entity alignment module to achieve unsupervised alignment. Experimental results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate improved performance compared to several recent baseline methods. Additional ablation experiments further corroborate the efficacy of the proposed modules.},

  abstract     = {Entity relation extraction is a key technology for extracting structured information from unstructured text and serves as the foundation for building large-scale knowledge graphs. Current joint entity relation extraction methods primarily focus on improving the recognition of overlapping triplets to enhance the overall performance of the model. However, the model still faces numerous challenges in managing intra-triplet and inter-triplet interactions, expanding the breadth of semantic encoding, and reducing information redundancy during the extraction process. These issues make it challenging for the model to achieve satisfactory performance in both normal and overlapping triple extraction. To address these challenges, this study proposes a comprehensive prediction network that includes multi-feature semantic fusion. We have developed a semantic fusion module that integrates entity mask embedding sequences, which enhance connections between entities, and context embedding sequences that provide richer semantic information, to enhance inter-triplet interactions and expand semantic encoding. Subsequently, using a parallel decoder to simultaneously generate a set of triplets, improving the interaction between them. Additionally, we utilize an entity mask sequence to finely prune these triplets, optimizing the final set of triplets. Experimental results on the publicly available datasets NYT and WebNLG demonstrate that, with BERT as the encoder, our model outperforms the baseline model in terms of accuracy and F1 score.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of multimodal sentiment analysis hinges on the seamless integration of information from diverse modalities, where the quality of modality fusion directly influences sentiment analysis accuracy. Prior methods often rely on intricate fusion strategies, elevating computational costs and potentially yielding inaccurate multimodal representations due to distribution gaps and information redundancy across heterogeneous modalities. This paper centers on the backpropagation of loss and introduces a Transformer-based model called Multi-Task Learning and Mutual Information Maximization with Crossmodal Transformer (MMMT). Addressing the issue of inaccurate multimodal representation for MSA, MMMT effectively combines mutual information maximization with crossmodal Transformer to convey more modality-invariant information to multimodal representation, fully exploring modal commonalities. Notably, it utilizes multi-modal labels for uni-modal training, presenting a fresh perspective on multi-task learning in MSA. Comparative experiments on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate that MMMT improves model accuracy while reducing computational burden, making it suitable for resource-constrained and real-time performance-requiring application scenarios. Additionally, ablation experiments validate the efficacy of multi-task learning and probe the specific impact of combining mutual information maximization with Transformer in MSA.},
