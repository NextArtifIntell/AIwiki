  abstract     = {Maintaining equipment and machinery in industries is imperative for maximizing operational efficiency and prolonging their lifespan. The adoption of predictive maintenance enhances resource allocation, productivity, and product quality by proactively identifying and addressing potential equipment anomalies through rigorous data analysis before they escalate into critical issues. Consequently, these measures strengthen market competitiveness and generate favorable economic outcomes. In many applications, sensors operate at high frequencies or capture data over extended periods. This work introduces CONELPABO (Composite Networks Learning via Parallel Bayesian Optimization), a framework for analyzing long time series data, particularly for predicting the remaining useful life of a system or component. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to manage the exponential growth in the hyperparameter search space during Bayesian Optimization and to accelerate model training by 50%. Additionally, this strategy enables the training of deeper networks with limited resources. The usefulness of the framework is demonstrated through two case studies, in which it achieves state-of-the-art results, showing that CNN-CNN and RNN-RNN architectures are highly effective for long time-series data. These architectures outperform many existing approaches and challenge the common academic focus on CNN-RNN hybrids.},

  abstract     = {The optimum scheduling of the conventional thermal generators for three different dynamic test systems is percolated in this article. In pursuit of this objective, a developed version of a recent optimization algorithm, denoted as the leader artificial hummingbird algorithm, is introduced. The profile with the largest penetration of wind energy is obtained by calculating wind power from hourly wind speed using the Weibull distribution density function. After that, the test system and the wind profiles were connected to carry out dynamic economic dispatch (DED). The DED problem with wind uncertainty poses important challenges because of its complication, considered by multiple constraints including ramp rate limits and the valve-point effects (VPEs), nonconvexity, and nonlinearity, as well as the uncertainty of the wind energy. These complications make it critical to discover innovative optimization algorithms to find optimum solutions for the DED problem. First, in order to demonstrate the validity of the suggested LAHA approach in comparison with four contemporary techniques, simulations are run on 23 benchmark functions. Next, the 5-unit, 10-unit with/without transmission losses, 15-unit, modified 10-unit with transmission losses, and wind power test systems are used to evaluate the LAHA’s performance. The numerical results demonstrate how competitive the suggested approach is in reaching reduced total generation cost when compared to the other documented optimization algorithms.},

This creates a trajectory of touch coordinates that contains rich information about the user. Previous work exploited this information to create Machine Learning (ML) models to predict demographic and behavioral targets, such as age, nationality, or handedness. However, previous work used pseudo-grid search, which is a bit tedious and rather inefficient. We show how to find better models with Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), by completely automating the architecture design process, outperforming all models reported in previous work. Our study suggests that researchers should incorporate AutoML to their training pipelines, as classification performance will likely be better than manually designing the model architecture. Taken together, our results show that it is possible to decode user’s latent information from shape-writing trajectories with higher performance than previously reported.},

  abstract     = {Facial expressions play a key role in human non-verbal type of communication, providing key insights into emotions and intentions. These expressions serve as universal signals, helping individuals convey their internal states across various personal and social contexts. With the growing interest in automatic facial emotion recognition, deep neural networks have emerged as a popular approach for detecting human emotions, even under challenging, real-world conditions. However, external factors can affect the system&#39;s performance, degrading the quality of facial features and making emotion detection more difficult. In the presented paper, we propose a highly optimized lightweight convolutional neural network (LCNN) for emotion recognition in controlled and uncontrolled environments. The proposed model is designed to learn hidden nonlinear patterns from facial images. The proposed convolutional neural network consisting a series of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. The model&#39;s performance is evaluated with and without pre-processing steps to highlight the importance of pre-processing in improving detection accuracy. The LCNN achieves 65% accuracy on the FER-2013 dataset and 98% on the CK + dataset.},

Our proposed framework combines bidirectional long short-term memory networks with bidirectional stochastic configuration networks (BSCN). This integration empowers the model to discern intricate patterns within both past and future time steps of the EEG signal. Furthermore, the non-iterative training characteristic of the BSCN-based classifier enhances training efficiency. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments on four epilepsy datasets and a sleep dataset. The performance of our novel technique was evaluated using a range of performance metrics, and the results unequivocally indicate its superiority over existing artifact removal methods.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel method for recognizing human actions through the semantic segmentation of images. The aim is to enhance action-motion dynamics by directing attention toward regions crucial for action recognition. The proposed approach utilizes a SegNet model with an incorporated attention mechanism and modified bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) backbone. The process begins with the generation of binary masks for each frame in a video dataset, achieved through a combination of grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, and adaptive thresholding. The emphasis on crucial regions for action recognition and capturing temporal variations is heightened through the application of the frame-ranking method. In our experiments, we observed that the proposed method significantly enhances the dynamics of the action-motion representation. The SegNet architecture was designed for semantic segmentation tasks and features an encoder-decoder architecture. In this structure, the model performs hierarchical feature extraction from the input image via the encoder, whereas the decoder focuses on reconstructing the segmented output. Attention is paid to the encoded feature maps, augmenting the model&#39;s capability to capture dependencies over extensive spatial ranges. A bidirectional GRU layer is employed to capture the sequential dependencies in the concatenated feature maps. The integration of the SegNet model with the attention mechanism and a BiGRU backbone, featuring an encoder-decoder architecture for feature extraction, classification, and segmentation, demonstrated superior performance in capturing nuanced spatiotemporal features. The proposed method demonstrated an accuracy of 98.52% for UCF101 and 84.25% for HMDB51. The findings reveal that the model achieves state-of-the-art results in human action recognition tasks, outperforming the existing methods in terms of accuracy. The combination of semantic segmentation and BiGRU-based temporal modeling proved effective in discerning intricate patterns of human motion, showcasing its potential for real-world applications in video analysis and surveillance systems.},

Compared with the existing literature, the significant advantage of this paper is that all three types of delays are taken into account. Here we consider time-varying delay depending on probability distribution conditions, so the results of this paper also rely on the problem of probability distribution of time-varying delay. By establishing a suitable comparison system, creating a new kind of impulsive delay inequality and applying Bernoulli distributions and Lyapunov theory, some conditions to realize quasi-synchronization of heterogeneous neural networks are studied. Finally we illustrate the validity of our theorem with numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problem of insufficient samples in low-light object detection in some environments, a low-light few-shot object detection method based on curve contrast enhancement and flow-encoder-based variational autoencoder (CCEFVAE) is proposed. Our approach involves designing a CCE module to enhance the detailed features and contrast of low-light images by deriving a relationship expression between the enhanced image and the low-light image through the recursive relationship of high-order curves. The lumination estimation module in the CCE module estimates the parameters of the expression to calculate the pixel values of the enhanced image. Moreover, we propose an FVAE module to improve the decoupling of support features by combining the flow model encoder with the variational autoencoder, facilitating subsequent feature aggregation and classification. To ensure the consistency of the loss function of the flow model with the few-shot object detection loss, we design a negative Jacobian determinant transformation function. This enables direct addition of the two losses, allowing for unified optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms mainstream few-shot object detection models by an average of 13.1–23% in average after training on the low-light dataset (ExDark), and shows an average improvement of 5.8% compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot object detection model VFA. When trained on the normal lighting dataset (PASCAL VOC), the proposed algorithm exhibits a 1.7% improvement in average compared to VFA.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an optimization algorithm called supercell thunderstorm algorithm (STA) is proposed. STA draws inspiration from the strategies employed by storms, such as spiral motion, tornado formation, and the jet stream. It is a computational algorithm specifically designed to simulate and model the behavior of supercell thunderstorms. These storms are known for their rotating updrafts, strong wind shear, and potential for generating tornadoes. The optimization procedures of the STA algorithm are based on three distinct approaches: exploring a divergent search space using spiral motion, exploiting a convergent search space through tornado formation, and navigating through the search space with the aid of the jet stream. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed STA algorithm in achieving optimal solutions for various optimization problems, a series of test sequences were conducted. Initially, the algorithm was tested on a set of 23 well-established functions. Subsequently, the algorithm’s performance was assessed on more complex problems, including ten CEC2019 test functions, in the second experimental sequence. Finally, the algorithm was applied to five real-world engineering problems to validate its effectiveness. The experimental results of the STA algorithm were compared to those of contemporary metaheuristic methods. The analysis clearly demonstrates that the developed STA algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of performance.},

  abstract     = {At present, scene text detection is grabbing more and more attention as an offshoot of machine vision. However, due to the existing long types of text instances and complex background context, less exact localization and higher missed detection cases still remain in text detection domain. Accordingly, with the aim of tackling these two issues, we propose a text detector named GP-PSENet that comprises a combination of a group-related dilated encoder, a parallel extensional dilation-wise residual encoder and a mixed upsample. Firstly, feature maps of the lowest level processed by the backbone network are sent to a dilated encoder with group linkage. And the group residual module provides stratification to join group coefficients and dilated factors. This module can enhance the correctness of predictions about longer boundary boxes. Secondly, semantic information from the highest level is fed into a parallel extensional dilation-wise residual encoder. The extensional dilation-wise module is capable of obtaining diverse receptive fields by more parallel branches. And it can alleviate error detection from interfering material in the background. Thirdly, the feature maps processed in the second step are given to the mixed upsample module for transforming so as to the next fuse. Finally, the processed two-level feature maps are fused and sent to the progressive scale expansion algorithm for the final post-processing to gain the predicted coordinate points. Ablation experiments are conducted on CTW1500, ICDAR15, MSRA-TD500 and Total-Text datasets to confirm the availability of the proposed method. The values of precision on these datasets reach 86.24%, 87.84%, 73.98% and 90.48%. The proposed method is also competitive with other scene detection methods.},

In order to overcome the lack of flexibility when coping with uncertainties and topology changes, a multi-agent based proximal policy optimization algorithm (MAPPO) is proposed in this paper. Different from the offline training and online implementing mode, the proposed decentralized MAPPO algorithm has the characteristic of online training and online application, which can get higher optimization efficiency and lower communication burden. Taking into account users’ satisfaction, renewable energy utilization rate and operating costs, an optimization model is established. Aiming at the difficulty on satisfying the power balance constraint in EMPU using reinforcement learning (RL), a novel power imbalance penalty is designed. Compared with the traditional penalty function, the proposed penalty function can effectively avoid the phenomenon of power imbalance. Finally, 24-hour energy management results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the proposed MAPPO is compared with several popular multi-agent based RL algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has higher efficiency and can obtain better energy management strategies.},

Our framework employs a diffusion probabilistic model, benefiting from the higher spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 satellite during training via a new multi-modal loss formulation. This ensures consistency with the original S3 images while enhancing the spatial details. Two distinct conditional low-resolution encoders were experimented with, providing insights into their respective contributions to the diffusion process. The efficacy of the proposed model is demonstrated through extensive ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, using both synthetic and real S3 products.

  abstract     = {Different techniques have been developed for object detection and recognition. These techniques can be divided into single-shot and two-shot methods. Single-shot methods focus on real-time applications, while two-shot methods are used in applications requiring higher accuracy. However, different versions of the two-shot techniques produce limited results in terms of accuracy and speed, or both. Therefore, this study proposes a novel model called dynamic generative R-CNN (DGR-CNN) that reduces the number of proposed regions using a dynamic programming model that applies the graph similarity method over graph-based image segmentation. Additionally, the proposed model employs DCGAN technique to improve detection performance. DGR-CNN reduces the overall detection and classification time and enhances the detection accuracy. The PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets were utilized to evaluate the model. The results showed that DGR-CNN significantly reduces the number of candidate regions compared to the selective search algorithm employed in R-CNN and fast R-CNN. Although fast R-CNN utilizes 2000 regions and faster R-CNN utilizes 300 regions, DGR-CNN reduces the number of regions to approximately 130. The mean average precision of the proposed method was 75.1% on the PASCAL VOC2007, while fast and faster R-CNN scored 66.9% and 69.9%, respectively. Moreover, the DGR-CNN model significantly improved the classification accuracy when tested on the MS COCO dataset, achieving an MAP of 68.76%, compared with 32.64% and 42.3% for fast and faster R-CNN. This increase in accuracy was achieved without significantly compromising the speed compared with faster R-CNN.},

This paper explores a new non-gradient-based method to train ANNs and deep ANNs, the Continuous Action Learning Automata (CALA) optimizer. The CALA optimizer assigns a Learning Automata agent to every weight in a neural network and uses game theory to coordinate actions of the agents. We show that the CALA optimizer is computationally efficient, that it converges to a desired error rate faster than current gradient-based methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and show how one could use a Finite Action Learning Automata (FALA) algorithm to find optimal values for the hyper-parameters required to optimize the CALA controller. The CALA method contrasts itself against other non-gradient methods in that it approaches the computational efficiency of top gradient descent methods like SGD. The CALA method converges fast, and there is any easy-to-follow algorithm to tune the hyper-parameters of the algorithm. These advantages address weaknesses that other non-gradient methods suffer from. Therefore, the CALA controller has the potential to see far greater implementation than other non-gradient-based optimization methods for training deep ANNs.},

Accurately positioning the insulator is extremely crucial for proceeding to the insulator defect detection. However, during UAV electrical line inspection, the presence of the electric power line magnetic field engenders a reduction in the pixel representation of the insulator within the image data, thereby diminishing the accuracy of insulator detection. In response to the prevailing issues, we present the creation of the adaptive dual-weighted feature network in this paper. Simultaneously, we create an insulator dataset to substantiate the effectiveness of enhanced model in detecting small insulators. Firstly, the integration of context fusion network is employed to capture comprehensive contextual features for each effective feature map. In addition, a cross-scale residual perception network is incorporated into the neck prior to three concatenation modules, facilitating the collection of diverse information across levels. Finally, a Dual-Weighted Feature Fusion module is designed to replace the conventional concatenation pattern within the neck, thus achieving a more precise representation of object features. Experiments are conducted on the insulator dataset, the RSOD dataset and the NWPU VHR-10 dataset to evaluate the designed model, resulting in mAP values that were 3.92%, 1.55% and 2.39% higher than the YOLOv7, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Pooling operations, such as average pooling, strided convolution, and max pooling, have become fundamental components of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to their ability to capture local features, expand receptive fields, and reduce computational costs. However, in the context of semantic segmentation, these pooling techniques can lead to the loss of crucial spatial details that are necessary for accurate pixel-level predictions. To tackle this issue, extensive research has focused on refining deep CNN models through architectural adaptations and novel training methods. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of pooling layers, exemplified by innovations like the introduction of wavelet pooling. In our study, we highlight the value of incorporating our previously proposed matched wavelet pooling (MWP) into CNNs to enhance semantic segmentation pipelines. The core concept of MWP challenges the notion that including all sub-bands generated from wavelet decomposition consistently improves accuracy. Instead, we advocate for selecting specific sub-bands for the pooling process in each image during both training and testing. This approach introduces sub-band selection protocols customized for image-specific pooling, designed specifically for semantic segmentation CNN architectures, with a particular focus on the UNet and SegNet models. Across three widely used datasets, our proposed MWP- based pipeline, featuring the MWP-UNet architecture, consistently outperforms conventional pooling methods. It achieves a significant average improvement in intersection over union (IoU) of over 25% compared to recent literature. Additionally, our MWP-SegNet model outperformed the standard SegNet by 12.5% mIoU, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our matched wavelet pooling approach across different network architectures.},

  abstract     = {At the nexus of signal processing and machine learning (ML), silent speech recognition (SSR) has evolved as a game-changing technology that allows for communication without audible voice. This study offers a thorough overview of SSR, tracing its evolution from early waveform analysis to the most recent ML methods. We start by examining current SSR techniques using ML and determining the essential conditions for efficient SSR systems. After that, we look at the datasets and data collection techniques currently employed in SSR research, highlighting the difficulties posed by the variety of articulatory movements and the scarcity of data. Examining state-of-the-art SSR frameworks, the paper covers important topics such signal processing, feature extraction, ML techniques for decoding and optimizing and assessing the performance of SSR models. We emphasize how deep learning (DL) and ML models have evolved to increase SSR resilience and accuracy. The field&#39;s proposed procedures are examined, with an emphasis on sophisticated feature extraction and classification methods. Modern SSR techniques are compared in terms of performance, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of different models. There is also discussion of ethical issues, especially those pertaining to privacy and consent. The integration of multimodal information—visual cues, electromyography signals, and neuroimaging data—to improve SSR systems is covered in this work. We investigate the functions of transfer learning and domain adaptation in handling cross-subject variability. Lastly, the study offers suggestions and future prospects for SSR research, providing practitioners, engineers, and academics with a road map. As SSR continues to push the frontiers of human–machine interaction, our study aims to increase our collective understanding of the technological advances and societal effects of SSR in the ML age.},
