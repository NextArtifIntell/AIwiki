  abstract     = {Smart Digital Twins (SDTs) are being increasingly used to virtually replicate and predict the behaviors of complex physical systems through continual data assimilation, enabling the optimization of the performance of these systems by controlling the actions of systems. Recently, the Deep Learning (DL) models have significantly enhanced the capabilities of SDTs, particularly for tasks such as predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and optimization. In many domains, including medicine, engineering, and education, SDTs use image data (image-based SDTs) to observe, learn, and control system behaviors. This paper focuses on various approaches and associated challenges in developing image-based SDTs by continually assimilating image data from physical systems. The paper also discusses the challenges in designing and implementing DL models for SDTs, including data acquisition, processing, and interpretation. In addition, insights into the future directions and opportunities for developing new image-based DL approaches to develop robust SDTs are provided. This includes the potential for using generative models for data augmentation, developing multi-modal DL models, and exploring the integration of DL models with other technologies, including Fifth Generation (5 G), edge computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we describe the image-based SDTs, which enable broader adoption of the Digital Twins (DTs) paradigms across a broad spectrum of areas and the development of new methods to improve the abilities of SDTs in replicating, predicting, and optimizing the behavior of complex systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent trends, machine learning is widely used to support decision-making in various domains and industrial operations. Because of the increasing complexity of modern industries, industrial engineering aims not only to increase cost-effectiveness and productivity but also to consider sustainability, resilience, and human centricity, resulting in many-objective, constrained, and stochastic operations research. Based on the above stringent requirements, combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are thus developed to support the complicated decision-making process in operations research. Due to the computational complexity of exact algorithms and the uncertain solution quality of heuristic methods, there is a growing trend to leverage the power of machine learning in solving CO problems, known as neural combinatorial optimization (NCO), where reinforcement learning (RL) is the core to achieve the sequential decision support. This survey study provides a comprehensive investigation of the theories and recent advancements in applying RL to solve hard CO problems, such as vehicle routing, bin packing, assignment, scheduling, and planning problems, and, in addition, summarizes the applications of neural combinatorial optimization with reinforcement learning (NCO-RL). The detailed review found that although the research domain of NCO-RL is still under-explored, its research potential has been proven to address environmental sustainability, adaptability, and human factors. Last but not least, the technical challenges and opportunities of the NCO-RL to embrace the industry 5.0 paradigm are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Dysarthria, a speech disorder commonly associated with neurological conditions, poses challenges in early detection and accurate diagnosis. This study addresses these challenges by implementing preprocessing steps, such as noise reduction and normalization, to enhance the quality of raw speech signals and extract relevant features. Scalogram images generated through wavelet transform effectively capture the time-frequency characteristics of the speech signal, offering a visual representation of the spectral content over time and providing valuable insights into speech abnormalities related to dysarthria. Fine-tuned deep learning models, including pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like VGG19, DenseNet-121, Xception, and a modified InceptionV3, were optimized with specific hyperparameters using training and validation sets. Transfer learning enables these models to adapt features from general image classification tasks to classify dysarthric speech signals better. The study evaluates the models using two public datasets TORGO and UA-Speech and a third dataset collected by the authors and verified by medical practitioners. The results reveal that the CNN models achieve an accuracy (acc) range of 90% to 99%, an F1-score range of 0.95 to 0.99, and a recall range of 0.96 to 0.99, outperforming traditional methods in dysarthria detection. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach, leveraging deep learning and scalogram images to advance early diagnosis and healthcare outcomes for individuals with dysarthria.},

  abstract     = {Ischemic, one of the fatal diseases characterized by insufficient blood supply to tissues poses a significant global health burden, necessitating the development of robust diagnostic and classification methodologies. Timely identification, intervention, and treatment are essential to reduce associated risk factors. Modern machine learning methods like deep learning and neural networks are being successfully employed on medical images to detect and segment the region of interest for various diseases where the performance of these computational methods is improving daily and for various tasks has surpassed natural intelligence. This success has convinced medical practitioners to trust computational methods and incorporate computer-based solutions into their clinical practices. It is, therefore, essential to examine the available solutions critically by considering their strengths and weaknesses to establish their trust and clinical applicability. In the context of the above-mentioned task, this work focuses on two aspects: first, a broad review has been done for Ischemic stroke prognostication using various brain-imaging biomarkers via diverse deep learning frameworks, and second, the reviewed works are categorized based on their computational approach employed for Ischemic stroke detection, segmentation, and classification. Finally, this work presents recent advances and future research directions to invent high-performance methods. It was concluded that recent advancements in ischemic stroke detection have achieved 85–98% accuracy using CNNs and transformer-based models with separate imaging, clinical, and molecular data, though combined analysis remains largely underexplored. Integrating vascular imaging, clinical signs, and proteomic data can enhance real-time monitoring. However, challenges persist in unifying diverse parameters, necessitating advanced methodologies such as transfer learning, multi-task learning, advanced transformers, federated learning, and standardized protocols. These findings pave the way for improved diagnostics, treatment, and outcomes in stroke management.},

  abstract     = {In the field of image recognition, the all-MLP architecture (MLP-Mixer) shows superior performance. However, the current MLP-Mixer is solely based on fully connected layers. The nonlinear capability of fully connected layers is relatively weak, and their simple stacked structure has limitations under complex conditions. Therefore, inspired by the diversity of neurons in the human brain, we propose an innovative DMixNet, a dendritic multi-layered perceptron architecture. Rooted in the theory of dendritic neurons from neuroscience, we propose a dendritic neural unit (DNU) that enhances DMixNet with stronger biological interpretability and more robust nonlinear processing capabilities. The flexibility of dendritic structures allows the DNU to adjust its architecture to achieve different functionalities. Based on the DNU, we propose a novel channel fusion network $$\text {DNU}_\text {E}$$ and a dendritic classifier $$\text {DNU}_\text {C}$$ . The $$\text {DNU}_\text {E}$$ substitutes the traditional two fully connected layers as the channel mixer, constructing a dendritic mixer layer to enhance the fusion capability of channel information within the entire framework. Meanwhile, the $$\text {DNU}_\text {C}$$ replaces the traditional linear classifier, effectively improving the model’s classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DMixNet achieves improvements of 2.13%, 4.79%, 4.71%, 23.14% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and COIL-100 benchmark image recognition datasets, respectively, as well as a 14.78% enhancement on the medical image classification dataset PathMNIST, outperforming other state-of-the-art architectures.

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is crucial for human–computer interaction yet poses significant challenges. While various techniques exist for detecting emotions through EEG signals, contemporary studies have explored the combination of EEG signals with other modalities. However, the field is still rapidly evolving, and new advancements are constantly being made. Comprehensive research is essential by distilling all factors in one manuscript to stay up-to-date with the latest research findings. This review offers an overview of multimodal leaning in EEG-based emotion recognition and discusses current literature in this domain from 2017 to 2024. Three primary challenges addressed are the fusion algorithm, representation of different modalities, and classification scheme. The review thoroughly explores the challenges of fusion algorithms, representation of different modalities, and classification schemes through empirical studies, offering a detailed analysis of their effectiveness. The approach of fusion algorithms is compared and evaluated based on convention and deep learning fusion methods. The research results show that poor performance is attributed to a lack of rigor and inadequate methods to identify correlated patterns across modalities to create a unified representation for experiments. This indicates a need for more thorough analysis and integration of data in future studies. When more than two modalities are involved, it becomes increasingly important to consider different aspects of classification schemes, such as the number of features and model selection. However, designing a classification scheme without considering the number of parameters and emotional categories may compromise the accuracy of classification. To aid readers in understanding the findings better, the results of different classification schemes and their corresponding accuracies are summarized. The tables in this draft display the fusion algorithms researchers utilize and evaluate the effectiveness of selected modalities, providing valuable insights for decision-making. Key contributions include a systematic survey of EEG features, an exploration of EEG integration with behavioral modalities, an investigation of fusion methods, and an overview of key challenges and future research directions in implementing multimodal emotion recognition systems.},

  abstract     = {Amidst the ongoing digital transformation, enterprises face the challenge of managing ever-expanding volumes of data from multiple sources and diverse structures. Semantic data fabric emerges as a promising solution, offering an innovative approach to integrate data resources from various channels and produce meaningful insights. The selection of an appropriate data fabric solution has become a focal point amidst burgeoning data lakes and silos, garnering international attention. This research aims to precisely evaluate potential data fabric solutions using an innovative synergetic intuitionistic fuzzy evaluation model. We propose a hybrid approach, IF-AHP-Entropy-ELECTRE, which integrates the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), entropy, and elimination et choix traduisant la réalité (ELECTRE) techniques within the framework of intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets. This model is utilized to a data fabric solution selection (DFSS) issue for an appliance company, identifying the optimal solution based on its superior performance in foundational technology, real-time analytics, and customizable features. The effectiveness and adaptability of this approach stem from a novel hierarchical evaluative criteria system encompassing technology, capability, cost, and security. The criteria weights, derived from IF-AHP-Entropy, reflect both subjective and objective judgments of decision-makers, while the ranking generated by IF-ELECTRE employs a piecewise scoring function and a unique distance measure, factoring in optimistic perspectives and cross-information. Through sensitivity and comparative analyses, our approach demonstrates enhanced robustness, precision, and adaptability in dynamic DFSS contexts when compared to traditional multicriteria decision-making methods, such as IF-WSM, IF-TOPSIS, and IF-ELECTRE. Specifically, our model provides a decision support system that combines extensive functionality with a user-friendly design, making it highly effective for DFSS challenges. This approach not only establishes a solid foundation for data integration in data management but also enhances business competitiveness and supports sustained growth in the digital economy.},

  abstract     = {Path planning in autonomous driving systems remains a critical challenge, requiring algorithms capable of generating safe, efficient, and reliable routes. Existing state-of-the-art methods, including graph-based and sampling-based approaches, often produce sharp, suboptimal paths and struggle in complex search spaces, while trajectory-based algorithms suffer from high computational costs. Recently, meta-heuristic optimization algorithms have shown effective performance but often lack learning ability due to their inherent randomness. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking framework, named Reda’s Path Planning Benchmark 2024 (RP2B-24), alongside two novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based path-planning algorithms: Q-Spline Multi-Operator Differential Evolution (QSMODE), utilizing Q-learning (Q-tables), and Deep Q-Spline Multi-Operator Differential Evolution (DQSMODE), based on Deep Q-networks (DQN). Both algorithms are integrated under a single framework and enhanced with cubic spline interpolation to improve path smoothness and adaptability. The proposed RP2B-24 library comprises 50 distinct benchmark problems, offering a comprehensive and generalizable testing ground for diverse path-planning algorithms. Unlike traditional approaches, RL in QSMODE/DQSMODE is not merely a parameter adjustment method but is fully utilized to generate paths based on the accumulated search experience to enhance path quality. QSMODE/DQSMODE introduces a unique self-training update mechanism for the Q-table and DQN based on candidate paths within the algorithm’s population, complemented by a secondary update method that increases population diversity through random action selection. An adaptive RL switching probability dynamically alternates between these Q-table update modes. DQSMODE and QSMODE demonstrated superior performance, outperforming 22 state-of-the-art algorithms, including the IMODEII. The algorithms ranked first and second in the Friedman test and SNE-SR ranking test, achieving scores of 99.2877 (DQSMODE) and 93.0463 (QSMODE), with statistically significant results in the Wilcoxon test. The practical applicability of the algorithm was validated on a ROS-based system using a four-wheel differential drive robot, which successfully followed the planned paths in two driving scenarios, demonstrating the algorithm’s feasibility and effectiveness for real-world scenarios. The source code for the proposed benchmark and algorithm is publicly available for further research and experimentation at: https://github.com/MohamedRedaMu/RP2B24-Benchmark and https://github.com/MohamedRedaMu/QSMODEAlgorithm .},

Although various belief entropies can meet some basic requirements, how to judge the performance of belief entropies is still an open issue. This paper proposes a novel evidential neural network (ENN) classifier to evaluate different belief entropies in practical application. Driven by the least commitment principle (LCP), the maximum entropy is integrated into the traditional divergence-based loss function. The proposed loss function consists of divergence and maximum entropy parts, which considers not only the distribution difference but also the degree of approaching the maximum entropy. Some classification experiments are conducted in 7 real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation method.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems empower users with tailored service assistance by learning about their interactions with systems and recommending items based on their preferences and interests. Typical recommender systems view the recommendation process as a static procedure disregarding the fact that users’ preferences are changed over time. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are the most advanced and recent techniques used by researchers to handle challenges where the user’s interest is captured by their most recent interactions with the system. However, most of the recent research on RL-based recommender systems focuses on simply the user’s recent interactions to generate the recommendations without taking into account the context of the user in which these interactions occur. The context has a great impact on users’ interests, behaviors, and ratings e.g., user mood, time, day type, companion, social circle, and location. In this paper, we propose a context-aware deep reinforcement learning-based recommender system focusing on context-specific state modeling methods. In this approach, states are designed based on the user’s most recent context. In parallel, a list-wise version of the context-aware recommender agent is also proposed, in which a list of items is recommended to users at each step of interaction based on their context. The findings of the study indicate that modeling users’ preferences in combination with contextual variables improves the performance of RL-based recommender systems. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed method on context-based datasets in an offline environment. The performance in terms of evaluation measures optimally indicates the worth of the proposed method in comparison with existing studies. More precisely, the highest Presicion@5, MAP@10, and NDCG@10 of the context-aware recommender agent are 77%, 76%, and 74% respectively.},

  abstract     = {Automatic cephalometric landmark detection has emerged as a pivotal area of research that combines medical imaging, computer vision, and orthodontics. The identification of cephalometric landmarks is of utmost importance in the field of orthodontics, as it contributes significantly to the process of diagnosing and planning treatments, as well as conducting research on craniofacial aspects. This practice holds the potential to improve clinical decision-making and ultimately increase the outcomes for patients. This work explores a wide range of strategies, encompassing both traditional edge-based methods and advanced deep learning approaches. The study leveraged various academic publication databases like IEEEXplore, ScienceDirect, arXiv, Springer and PubMed to thoroughly search for articles related to automatic cephalometric landmark detection. Additionally, other pertinent publications were acquired from credible sources like Google Scholar and Wiley databases. Screening the articles relied on three selection criteria: (a) publication titles, abstracts, literature reviews, (b) cephalometric radiograph datasets suitable for 2D landmarking, and (c) studies conducted over different time periods were employed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of methodologies used in landmark prediction to identify the most relevant papers for this review. The initial electronic database search identified 268 papers on landmark detection. A total of 118 publications were selected and incorporated in the present study after a meticulous screening process. Performance analysis was conducted on studies that reported Successful Detection Rates (SDRs) within different clinically accepted precision ranges, Mean Radial Error (MRE) with Standard Deviation (SD) between manually annotated and automated landmarks as outcomes. Bar graphs and custom combination plots were utilized to analyse the correlations among different methodologies employed and their evaluation metrics outcomes. The performance comparison results indicate that Deep Learning techniques showed superior accuracy in automating 2D cephalometric landmarks compared to other conventional and Machine Learning approaches. Recently, more advanced Deep Learning algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy of automatic landmark prediction.},

In addition, we survey neuroinformatics and its various subdomains to understand the current state of the field and where QDL stands relative to recent advancements. Our statistical analysis of tumor classification studies (n = 16) reveals that QDL models achieved a mean accuracy of 0.9701 (95% CI 0.9533–0.9868), slightly outperforming classical models with a mean accuracy of 0.9650 (95% CI 0.9475–0.9825). We observed similar trends across Alzheimer’s diagnosis, stroke lesion detection, cognitive state monitoring, and brain age prediction, with QDL demonstrating better performance in metrics such as F1-score, dice coefficient, and RMSE. Our findings, paired with prior documented quantum advantages, highlight QDL’s promise in healthcare applications as quantum technology evolves.

This study addresses the issue of content generalizability by comparing FER model performance between models trained on video data collected in a controlled laboratory environment, data extracted from a social media platform (YouTube), and synthetic data generated using Generative Adversarial Networks. The videos focus on facial reactions to advertisements, and the integration of these different data sources seeks to address underrepresented advertisement genres, emotional reactions, and individual diversity. Our FER models leverage Convolutional Neural Networks Xception architecture, which is fine-tuned using category based sampling. This ensures training and validation data represent diverse advertisement categories, while testing data includes novel content to evaluate generalizability rigorously. Precision–recall curves and ROC-AUC metrics are used to assess performance. Results indicate a 7% improvement in accuracy and a 12% increase in precision–recall AUC when combining real-world social media and synthetic data, demonstrating reduced overfitting and enhanced content generalizability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating synthetic and real-world data to build FER systems that perform reliably across more diverse and representative content.},

To address this, an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy generator is proposed to develop an advanced low-light image enhancement model for referenced image datasets. The enhancement process involves a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) based optimization approach with respect to the parameters of the generator. For experimental validation, the Low-Light (LOL), LOLv2-Real and LOLv2-Synthetic benchmark datasets are utilized. The results are compared with several existing techniques using quality metrics such as SSIM, peak signal-to-noise ratio, absolute mean brightness error, mean absolute error, root mean squared error, blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator and naturalness image quality evaluator, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed model.

  abstract     = {Recording dance movements nowadays becomes problematic due to complex recording procedures and unavoidable data loss caused by some resource elements, like bodily or clothing material composition. The task of filling in the missing data for the performed motion and retrieving the sequence as a whole becomes difficult due to the characteristics of physical motion, which include cinematographic perspectives that render the movements themselves non-linear. Previous works have indicated some level of success in loss motion recovery, but only for a short span. The first two-dimensional matrix computation paradigm lacks theoretical justification for the recovery of the non-linear motion information, which is a limitation. This issue has been addressed by developing a new enhanced model called the Machine Learning 2-Dimensional Matrix-Calculation (ML-2DMC), which is presumably designed to achieve the rehabilitation and recovery of human movement and dance. The proposed procedure takes advantage of the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithms and applies 2D matrix computation methods, permitting good results across a variety of experiments. A new method called fractal-chaotic map grey wolf optimizer (FCM-GWO) is introduced to optimize the parameters of ML-2DMC. This optimization itself increases the efficiency of the ML-2DMC model when it comes to the retrieval of complex movements of the processes involving dance. The paper gives experimental results validating the efficiency of the proposed approach against other methods, such as recurrent convolutional neural networks and other more sophisticated models and approaches incorporating multi-paradigm sensors and devices such as Kinect sensors along with low-rank matrix completion methods. The study shows that the ML-2DMC-FCM-GWO method effectively tackles the complexities of non-linear human motion and dance recovery, making a significant addition to the field of motion analysis and restoration.},

Typically, in the civil infrastructure, there are significant benefits to be gained from AI-driven applications. This study reviews the implementation of the AI in bridge maintenance decision-making by conducting a review of literature on major works undertaken by researchers and analysing 102 scientific articles published from 2010 to 2023. Our literature review revealed an emerging trend in recent studies, focusing on the exploration of defect prognosis in bridge maintenance. However, upon further analysis, it becomes evident that there is a notable gap in the existing literature, in the studies related to performance-based prognostic maintenance strategies for bridges. This gap presents an opportunity for future research, one that could yield valuable insights in the field of bridge maintenance and asset management.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has accumulated a large amount of data, which needs to be stored, processed and deeply analyzed to meet the specific goals and needs of users. As an emerging computing model, Fog computing can allocate a large number of computing resources reasonably. In order to solve the problem of insufficient population diversity and low algorithm efficiency, Aiming at the task scheduling problem of Bag-of-Tasks(BoT) application in cloud and fog environment, a multi-strategy fusion Mayfly Algorithm was proposed. The method of improving the individual learning coefficient and the global learning coefficient is used to significantly improve the convergence speed, local search ability, and global search ability, and then the method of improving the social positive attraction coefficient is used to balance the development and exploration ability of the algorithm and help the algorithm to get rid of the local optimum. The main goal of the logarithm Mayfly Algorithm (lMA) is to complete the tasks of the IoT task package in the fog system efficiently with low cost in terms of reducing execution time and operating costs. The improved algorithms were compared with Mayfly Algorithm (MA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Tyrannosaurus Optimization Algorithm (TROA), Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA) and Red-Tailed Hawk Algorithm (RTH), and the results showed that lMA was significantly improved in terms of reducing processing time and operating cost. The performance of lMA is verified, and the results show that the model can not only save transmission energy consumption but also have good convergence.},

  abstract     = {The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS), an extension of intuitionistic and Pythagorean fuzzy sets, offers greater flexibility in representing vague information with two possible outcomes, yes or no. The fuzzy Zagreb index is an important graph parameter, widely used in fields such as network theory, spectral graph theory, mathematics, and molecular chemistry. In this paper, the first and second Zagreb indices for q-rung orthopair fuzzy graphs (q-ROFGs) are introduced, and bounds for these indices are established, including their behavior in regular q-ROFGs. Additionally, it is explored, how various graph operations such as union, Cartesian product, direct product, and lexicographical product affect the first Zagreb index. Furthermore, a new approach is presented that combines Multiple-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) with graph-based models to improve decision-making, particularly in vaccine selection. The methodology constructs a bipartite graph for each attribute, where virologists assign membership and non-membership values to vaccines. The Zagreb index is used to measure the importance of each vaccine, and a weighted aggregation technique normalizes the scores. The final ranking is derived from a computed score function. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in providing a systematic and mathematically rigorous framework for multi-attribute decision-making, with rank correlation analysis confirming its robustness compared to existing methods such as q-ROF PROMETHEE, q-ROF VICOR, q-ROF TOPSIS, q-ROFWG, and q-ROFWA.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modal retrieval aims to correlate multimedia data by bridging the heterogeneity gap. Most cross-modal retrieval approaches learn a common subspace to project the multimedia data into the subspace for directly measuring the similarity. However, the existing cross-modal retrieval frameworks cannot fully capture the semantic consistency in the limited supervision information. In this paper, we propose a Cross-coupled Semantic Adversarial Network (CSAN) for cross-modal retrieval. The main structure of this approach is mainly composed of the generative adversarial network, i.e., each modality branch is equipped with a generator and a discriminator. Besides, a cross-coupled semantic architecture is designed to fully explore the correlation of paired heterogeneous samples. To be specific, we couple a forward branch with an inverse mapping and implement a weight-sharing strategy of the inverse mapping branch to the branch of another modality. Furthermore, a cross-coupled consistency loss is introduced to minimize the semantic gap between the representations of the inverse mapping branch and the forward branch. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. By comparing against the previous works, the experiment results demonstrate our approach outperforms state-of-the-art works.},

  abstract     = {This review explores the growing need for AI-based algorithms in diagnosing fetal facial anomalies, which are often difficult to detect due to limitations in current imaging techniques like ultrasound and MRI. These challenges include low resolution, motion artifacts, and insufficient annotated data, which hinder early and accurate diagnosis. AI algorithms, particularly deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and U-Net, offers significant potential to overcome these challenges by analyzing large datasets and improving image analysis. Early diagnosis of these anomalies is crucial for enabling timely interventions, personalized treatment plans, and better prenatal care. This study adopts a systematic review approach, to assess existing research on AI-based approaches for fetal facial anomaly detection. The review includes peer-reviewed studies from key biomedical databases like PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect, focusing on the last 15 years. Studies that implemented AI techniques and manual techniques for detecting anomalies in prenatal images were considered. Among all models reviewed, CNNs and U-Net architectures were found to be the most effective. CNNs excel at classifying medical images, while U-Net is particularly powerful for image segmentation. These models have demonstrated high accuracy in identifying conditions such as cleft lip, palate, and micrognathia. The use of AI in clinical settings can greatly enhance the precision and efficiency of fetal anomaly detection, addressing current limitations in medical imaging. By integrating AI, particularly deep learning models, into clinical workflows, prenatal care can be transformed, allowing for earlier and more accurate diagnosis. This can lead to more personalized care, timely interventions, and ultimately improved health outcomes for affected individuals and their families.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors pose a significant health risk to humans. The edge boundaries in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often blurred and poorly defined, which can easily result in inaccurate segmentation of lesion areas. To address these challenges, we proposed an Automatic Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation based on deep fusion of Weak Edge and Context features (AS-WEC). First, AS-WEC introduces the Otsu Double Threshold Weak Edges Adaptive Detection (Otsu-WD), which focuses on tumor edge information and differentiates between lesion edges and normal cerebral sulci and gyri. Second, an edge branching network based on the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is constructed to fully preserve the edge context information of the lesion region. Finally, a maximum index fusion mechanism has been designed to incorporate a multilayer feature map, preventing the loss of edge details during the deep feature fusion process. The experimental results demonstrate that the Otsu-WD method outperforms the Canny and TEED algorithms in detecting brain MRI tumor edges. In brain MRI tumor segmentation, AS-WEC delivers a clearer visual segmentation effect compared to the classical UNet++ network and recent models like PVT-Former. On both datasets, AS-WEC demonstrated improvements across multiple metrics. The Dice averaged 92.96%, and the mIoU reached 93.12%, effectively validating the method’s efficacy in brain MRI tumor segmentation. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/DL-Segment/AS-WEC.git .},

  abstract     = {Clustering is a well-known unsupervised machine learning approach capable of automatically grouping discrete sets of instances with similar characteristics. Constrained clustering is a semi-supervised extension to this process that can be used when expert knowledge is available to indicate constraints that can be exploited. Well-known examples of such constraints are must-link (indicating that two instances belong to the same group) and cannot-link (two instances definitely do not belong together). The research area of constrained clustering has grown significantly over the years with a large variety of new algorithms and more advanced types of constraints being proposed. However, no unifying overview is available to easily understand the wide variety of available methods, constraints and benchmarks. To remedy this, this study presents in-detail the background of constrained clustering and provides a novel ranked taxonomy of the types of constraints that can be used in constrained clustering. In addition, it focuses on the instance-level pairwise constraints, and gives an overview of its applications and its historical context. Finally, it presents a statistical analysis covering 315 constrained clustering methods, categorizes them according to their features, and provides a ranking score indicating which methods have the most potential based on their popularity and validation quality.

  abstract     = {The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is motivated by the predatory nature of bubble nets and mimics dwindling and encircling, bubble net persecuting, and randomized wandering and foraging actions to locate the expansive adequate value. However, the WOA has several deficiencies: inadequate resolution accuracy, sluggish convergence speed, susceptibility to search stagnation, and insufficient localized detection efficiency. A quantum encoding WOA (QWOA) is introduced for global optimization and adaptive infinite impulse response (IIR) system identification. The quantum encoding mechanism exploits the principle of a quantum bit to encode a search agent, which manipulates the state of an essential quantum bit and amends the location data. The quantum rotation gate modulates the quantum bit’s configuration, the quantum NOT gate accomplishes bit mutation and prohibits precocious convergence. The probability amplitude of the quantum bit represents the multistate superposition state of the search agent, which enriches the population diversity, advances individualized information, broadens the detection scope, inhibits premature convergence, facilitates estimation effectiveness, and promotes solution accuracy. The QWOA not only promptly locates the search scope nearest the most appropriate solution but also computes the spiral-shaped encircling route to promote predation diversification. Twenty-three benchmark functions, eight real-world engineering layouts, and adaptive IIR system identification are utilized to assess the QWOA’s feasibility and effectiveness. The experimental results reveal that QWOA successfully equalizes exploration and exploitation to accelerate convergence speed, ameliorate calculation accuracy, and strengthen stability and robustness.},

The development of ACPs using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) follows a structured process, beginning with sequence collection from in vitro and in vivo experiments. Key features such as hydrophobicity and secondary structure are extracted, and classification models categorize peptides based on their properties. ML models predict anticancer effectiveness, followed by toxicity checks and Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) analysis to ensure safety and efficacy, with validation tests confirming their activity. This review explores how the automated design of ACPs can be enhanced by leveraging advanced ML and DL techniques. These methods, with their ability to automate feature selection and activity prediction, have significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of peptide discovery. This structured approach holds high potential to guide researchers in the automated design of ACPs, accelerating the discovery of effective peptides while ensuring safety. Special attention is given to new approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which show promise in addressing key challenges like data imbalance and computational complexity. Moreover, we examine the latest published research to compare the performance of various ML models in ACP prediction. By considering these advancements and challenges, this review outlines future opportunities for improving the scalability and reliability of ACP discovery using AI-driven techniques.
