  abstract     = {Visual servoing using image registration is a method employed in robotics to control the movement of a system using visual information. In this context, we propose a new intensity-based image registration algorithm (IBIR) that uses information derived from images acquired at different times or from different views to determine the parameters of the geometric transformations needed to align these images. The Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) is used to optimize these parameters, minimizing the difference between the images to be aligned. The proposed algorithm, Intensity-Based Image Registration via Arithmetic Optimisation Algorithm (IBIRAOA), is robust to image data fluctuations and perturbations and can avoid local optima. Simulation results prove the importance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of computation time and similarity of aligned images compared to other methods based on various metaheuristics. In addition, our results confirm a significant improvement in the trajectory of the wheeled mobile robot, thus reinforcing the overall effectiveness of our method in practical navigation and robotic control applications.},

  abstract     = {In the current landscape, there is a rapid increase in the creation of new algorithms designed for specialized problem scenarios. The performance of these algorithms in unfamiliar or practical settings often remains untested. This paper presents a new development, the multi-objective Runge–Kutta optimizer (MORKO), which is built upon the principles of elitist non-dominated sorting and crowding distance. The goal is to achieve superior efficiency, diversity, and robustness in solutions. MORKO effectiveness is further enhanced by incorporating various strategies that maintain a balance between diversity and execution efficiency. This approach not only directs the search toward optimal regions but also ensures that the process does not become stagnant. The efficiency of MORKO is compared against renowned algorithms like the multi-objective marine predicator algorithm (MOMPA), multi-objective gradient-based optimizer (MOGBO), multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) on several test benchmarks such as ZDT, DTLZ, constraint (CONSTR, TNK, SRN, BNH, OSY and KITA) and real-world engineering design (brushless DC wheel motor, safety isolating transformer, helical spring, two-bar truss, welded beam, disk brake, tool spindle and cantilever beam) problems. We used unique, non-overlapping performance metrics for this comparison and suggested a fresh correlation analysis technique for exploration. The MORKO algorithm outcomes were rigorously tested and confirmed using the non-parametric statistical evaluations. The MORKO algorithm proves to excel in deriving comprehensive and varied solutions for many tests and practical challenges, owing to its multifaceted features. Looking ahead, MORKO has potential applications in complex engineering and management tasks.},

  abstract     = {The multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is an optimization technique that mimics the foraging behavior of birds to solve difficult optimization problems. MOPSO is well known for its strong global search capability, which efficiently locates solutions that are close to the global optimum across a wide search domain. However, similar to many other optimization algorithms, the fast convergence property of MOPSO can occasionally lead to the population entering the local optimum too soon, obstructing researchers from investigating more efficient solutions. To address this challenge, the study proposes a novel framework that integrates the fireworks algorithm (FA) into MOPSO and establishes a size-double archiving mechanism to maintain population diversity. By preventing population homogenization, this mechanism promotes the retention of better solutions. Additionally, by fusing evolutionary data analysis with particle information, the study offers new individual optimal choices and adaptive parameter tuning to improve the algorithm’s robustness and adaptability and better manage the complexity of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). The suggested algorithm is compared with several existing MOPSOs and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in simulation experiments. Standard test problems like ZDT, UF, and DTLZ are used in the experiments. The new algorithm performs exceptionally well in terms of improving convergence and population diversity, as well as demonstrating significant competitiveness for solving MOPs.},

  abstract     = {As demonstrated in the section above, the stock market place is a dynamic factor, which makes it possible for traders and investors to make good decisions based on the information acquired through accurate prediction. This research aims at improving the prediction of stock market by applying a new method to Multi-attribute Group Decision making (MAGDM). MAGDM goes through a cycle of evaluating and ranking several criteria hence enhancing the decision-making aspects further. To overcome the shortcomings of prior models, some EU and FU is incorporated by combining Zadeh’s $${\hat{Z}}$$ -numbers with Picture Fuzzy Sets (PFSs). This integration is to enhance the ability of the model to address completely unclear decisions utilizing the peculiarities of $${\hat{Z}}$$ -numbers. To compare decisions between decision-makers, we proposed picture fuzzy $${\hat{Z}}$$ -numbers (PF $${\hat{Z}}$$ N) and for their aggregation, introduced picture fuzzy weighted averaging, picture fuzzy ordered weighted averaging, picture fuzzy hybrid averaging, picture fuzzy weighted geometric, picture fuzzy ordered weighted geometric and picture fuzzy hybrid geometric operators based algebraic $${\mathfrak {T}}$$ -norm ( $${\mathfrak {T}}-N$$ ) and $${\mathfrak {T}}$$ -conorm ( $${\mathfrak {T}}-CNs$$ ) To verify the efficiency of our suggested technique, we compare these operators with the Combined Compromised Solution (CoCoSo) model focusing on the stock market analysis. Our results, therefore, show how these operators are important in improving decision making accuracy and precision in conditions of risk. This research laid down the basis for enhancing decision-making and dealing with uncertainty in different fields especially in the application of stock market prediction. The proposed methodology can be attributed to providing a systematic and a more efficient way of dealing with uncertainty which in one way or the other has an outcome of enhancing the credibility of the decision making process in the financial sector.},

  abstract     = {The breast cancer (BC) prediction is improved through the machine learning (ML) techniques. In this study, we develop an innovative forecasting framework called the Dynamic Harris Hawks Optimized Gated Recurrent Unit (DHH-GRU) for the prediction of BC. It combines the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) methods. We gathered data and a training set that included the Wisconsin diagnostic BC (WDBC) dataset, which contains 569 patients with malignant and beginning cases. The collected data were pre-processed using min–max normalization, and important features were extracted by Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the process of reducing the dimensionality with principal component analysis (PCA). Decimal scaling is employed to equalize the various feature effects. The proposed DHH-GRU technique incorporated the GRU for capturing sequential connections on temporal medical information, and the optimization process, DHH optimization, is utilized. The proposed method&#39;s effectiveness is compared and estimated with various existing techniques in terms of log-loss (0.06%), accuracy (98.05%), precision (98.09%), F1-score (98.28%), and recall (98.15%). The proposed DHH-GRU method has a more predictive ability with the sequential dependency in capturing GRU and DHH optimization’s combined behaviour of hunting. This method significantly improved the accuracy of BC prediction.},

  abstract     = {Software dominates modern enterprises, affecting numerous functions. Software firms constantly experiment with new methodologies to define and assess software quality to stay competitive and ensure excellence. Software engineering uses fundamentals and cutting-edge technology to develop great software. In recent decades, Data-mining techniques and machine learning for classifying problematic software projects have emerged to improve software quality. ML approaches, especially ensemble learning models, are becoming fundamental to software engineers’ daily jobs. This work created a binary white shark optimizer (WSO) to optimize standard ensemble learning models. The objective is to identify the most suitable ensemble number for weak learners to maximize accuracy on benchmark datasets. The EM model uses 14 weak learners. Twenty-one experimental runs are performed on 15 software-defective module datasets. The optimized ensemble model outperforms the standard Ensemble learning model in AUC-ROC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Specificity. The enhanced model has an average accuracy of 86%, compared to 76% for the standard ensemble model across all datasets. The optimized model outperformed the conventional ensemble for the same datasets, with an average AUC of 72% compared to 61% for the standard ensemble. The optimized model was more stable than the standard model, with an STD of 5.53E−03 vs 7.24E−02 for the ensemble model. The WSO optimization process strengthens and generalizes optimizeels. The study suggests that evolutionary metaheuristic approaches can enhance EM models’ accuracy, trustworthiness, and adaptability.},

This study addresses this issue by proposing the idea of neutrosophic BrXII (NeS-BrXII) distribution. The primary objective is to study the statistical properties of the proposed model by providing explicit expressions of reliability properties, the expression of moments and generating function, expression of order statistics, mean residual life, mean inactivity time, stochastic ordering, income inequality measures, and entropy in neutrosophic realm. In addition, the neutrosophic model parameters are estimated using the principle of maximum-likelihood estimation. Further, the precision of these model estimates is verified via a simulation study of the proposed model. Applying the model on two real-world material sciences data sets reinforces its efficacy with the NeS-BrXII distribution proving to be more suitable for managing anomalies in neutrosophic surface analysis among other models.},

  abstract     = {Automated reasoning, a significant field within artificial intelligence, has attracted increased attention in recent years due to the rising demand for trustworthy AI. Binary resolution, among other inference rules, is crucial in automated reasoning of first-order logic, including the new conflict resolution method. Conflict resolution processes only two clauses in each deduction step and eliminates a complementary pairs of literals from input clauses. This paper proposes a contradiction separation conflict deduction (CSCD) method based on the contradiction separation rule to address these limitations. This novel resolution methodology, together with its automated reasoning theory and method, handles several clauses in each deduction step to seek for conflicts and generates learnt clauses through synergized deduction. Thus, the approach improves deduction by detecting conflicts more effectively, especially with lengthier input clauses. CSCD and conflict resolution are analyzed in detail, then how to create a practical CSCD algorithm and its implementation is summarized. We tested the CSCD algorithm to solve the CASC-26 problems and also applied it to the current leading ATP system (Eprover). Experimental results show that the CSCD deduction approach improves reasoning capability of conflict deduction method. Additionally, the Eprover with the proposed CSCD algorithm improves its performance and has solved various problems with a rating of 1 from the benchmark database TPTP.},

  abstract     = {Today, reliable power delivery and increasing demand are important issues in modern power systems. Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices are used to control transmission line parameters to increase power transfer and stability. Nevertheless, the problem of determining the optimal placement and sizing of these devices is still challenging, as the placement and sizing of the devices affects generation costs, power losses, voltage stability, and system reliability. This study proposes the Fata Morgana Algorithm (FATA), an optimization algorithm inspired by the natural process of mirage formation to optimize placement and sizing of FACTS devices in an IEEE 30 bus system with wind turbine integration. The FATA algorithm is evaluated against recently developed and improved optimization techniques, such as rime-ice formation phenomenon based Improved RIME (IRIME) Algorithm, Newton–Raphson-Based Optimization (NRBO), Resistance Capacitance Algorithm (RCA), Krill Optimization Algorithm (KOA), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), across multiple optimization objectives: reduction in generation cost, reduction in power loss and combined generation cost plus power loss, termed as Gross cost function. Results obtained show that FATA consistently outperforms the other algorithms in terms of convergence and solution quality, offering a robust approach to solving single objective optimization problems. FATA theoretically provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation, and produces better global solutions. It practically increases power system efficiency by lowering operational costs and losses and improving stability. Results indicate that the FATA algorithm produced minimum generation cost of 807.0405 $/h, which is 0.088–0.426% less than the competing algorithms. It also reduced power losses to 5.5917 MW, which is 1.095–6.781% less than other methods. For gross cost minimization, the FATA algorithm achieved a minimum gross cost of 1366.3727 $/h, which is 0.4799% better than the next best algorithm and 3.2261% better than the worst. The results also show that FATA is robust in solving complex optimization problems in power systems, and it provides significant improvements in run time and convergence efficiency. The main advantage for readers is that FATA provides a reliable and efficient way to optimize power systems. Future work could also investigate the application of FATA in real time, as well as in larger power networks with more renewable energy sources.},

More and more people are getting into VR, meaning that objective physiological measures to assess a user&#39;s emotional state automatically are becoming more critical. Individuals’ emotional states impact their behaviour, opinions, emotions, and decisions. They may be used to analyze VR experiences and make systems react to and engage with the user’s emotions. VR environments require users to wear head-mounted displays (HMDs), blocking off their upper faces. That makes traditional Facial Expression Recognition (FER) approaches very limited in their usefulness. Thus, a Deep Learning (DL) solution combined with image processing is utilized to classify universal emotions: sadness, happiness, disgust, anger, fear and surprise. Hence, this paper suggests the Deep Automatic Facial Expression Recognition Model (DAFERM) for interactive virtual reality (VR) applications such as intelligent education, social networks, and virtual training. Two main parts comprise the system: one that uses deep neural networks (DNNs) for facial emotion identification and another that automatically tracks and segments faces. The system begins by following a marker on the front of the head-mounted display (HMD). With the help of the spatial data that has been retrieved, the positions and rotations of the face are estimated to segment the mouth. Finally, the system interacts with DNN using the pixels processed by the lips. It obtains the facial expression results in real time using an adaptive method for histogram-based mouth segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) is adopted in a wide spectrum of applications in which a vast amount of data are produced and distributed to centralized cloud platforms to deliver various services. It involves smart devices that collect thousands of terabytes of heterogeneous data and deployed this to make instant decision that aids for the better performance and most comfort life. Traditional IoT architecture is heavily centralized, where it stores the most sensitive information that creates the multiple threats and security breaches as the attackers target towards these centralized cloud systems. To improve the security chain in IoT environment, edge computing (EC) was introduced to distribute the applications of IoT at the edge of the communication networks. However, these edge-based IoT are also vulnerable to many threats due to their decentralized and in secured management. Block chain (BC) technology offers a most trusted solution to resolve the security issues in the IoT-Edge computing environment. This research study presents the block chain driven medical image encryption technique using modified honey badger optimization with the ensemble chaotic systems. The proposed block chain framework uses the divergent methods that integrates differential scroll, Hénon chaotic maps and modified honey badger optimization to generate the optimum keys and high secured image data. These high secured data are stored in the block chain, ensuring the image security to be stored in edge nodes. The complete framework was experimented using Ethereum using Ganache API and Python3.19 are utilized as the major programs for designing the varied interfaces of the recommended model. The comprehensive experimentation is undertaken to assess the security strength of the recommended encryption scheme. The evaluation metrics like as NACI, UACI, Entropy and standard verification methods such as NIST standard tests are deployed and analyzed. To prove it security strength, proposed secured BC framework is compared with the wide-variety of secured frameworks. The experimental findings reveal that the suggested framework establishes a more robust and secure environment for image exchange, surpassing the performance of other blockchain-based systems in terms of integrity, robustness and security. Finally, the paper spreads the bright light of advantages in deploying the proposed framework to formulate the most secured environment in the IoT-Edge environment for medical image transmission.},

  abstract     = {Combined renewable energy sources (RESs) are emerging as a competitive alternative to conventional energy production facilities due to their sustainability and zero-emission characteristics. However, determining the optimal system size is complicated by two major challenges: the cost of energy (COE) and the intermittent nature of RESs. This study introduces a novel mathematical approach to optimize the sizing of photovoltaic (PV), wind, hydrogen, battery, and fuel cell systems with electrolyzers, specifically tailored for the remote area of Lavan Island. The proposed method aims to deliver electricity without reliance on the traditional electricity distribution grid, while offering a scalable solution applicable to other geographical regions. The primary objective is to achieve cost-effective electricity generation while ensuring a reliable energy supply through the evaluation of system reliability indices. A fuzzy logic system is employed to minimize the costs of a hybrid system incorporating hydroelectric, wind, solar, and battery technologies, while simultaneously calculating two key reliability metrics: the Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and the Dump Energy Probability (DEP). To optimize the objective function, this study applies three advanced algorithms: the Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA), the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and the Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA). These algorithms are used to determine the global optimum, with comparative analyses conducted to highlight the performance of the proposed approach. The results are evaluated based on statistical metrics, including consistency, execution time, convergence speed, and the minimization of the objective function. The findings demonstrate the superiority and the reliability of the proposed method over alternative approaches, paving the way for cost-efficient and sustainable energy solutions in isolated regions.},

  abstract     = {In current relation extraction tasks, when the input sentence structure is complex, the performance of in-context learning methods based on large language model is still lower than that of traditional pre-train fine-tune models. For complex sentence structures, dependency syntax information can provide effective prior text structure information for relation extraction. However, most studies are affected by the noise in the syntactic information automatically extracted by natural language processing toolkits. Additionally, traditional pre-training encoders have issues such as an overly centralized representation of word embedding for high-frequency words, which adversely affects the model to learn contextual semantic information. To address proposed problem, the paper proposes a Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network Relation Extraction Model Combine Dependency Syntax and Contrastive Learning. Based on the hyperbolic graph neural network, dependent syntactic information and information optimization strategies are introduced to solve the problem of word embedding concentration. Simultaneously, to mitigate the impact of noise in dependency syntax information on the relation extraction task, a contrastive learning approach is employed. After the model learns context semantics separately in the original dependency syntax information and dependency syntax information with added random noise, it maximizes the mutual information between entity words to assist the model in distinguishing noise in dependency syntax. The experiments indicate that the proposed model in this paper can effectively enhance the performance of relation extraction on public datasets, especially achieving significantly higher precision on datasets with complex sentence structures compared to in-context learning.},

The proposed model aggregates the Conv1D, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and dropout layers to extract temporal and spatial features from IoT traffic effectively.

A comparative analysis with other baseline models, such as LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), proved that enhanced LSTM outperformed the other models. This indicates the robustness of the proposed model in correctly detecting DDoS attacks with high generalization capability for unseen traffic data.

Since these technologies are deeply rooted in the individual’s comfort life, protecting the user’s privacy and security against the growing DoS attack has become a major challenge among researchers. In recent times, intrusion detection systems (IDS) have developed a vital part in ensuring security against these growing attacks. IDS is still unable to attain the optimum categorization performance due to a few bottlenecks. The speed and performance of the existing IDS are challenged by the intricacy of high-dimensional data and the efficacy of the conventional base classifiers. To tackle this aforementioned problem, this research article presents the hybrid IDS based on the combination of stacked feature selection methods such as Random Boruta Selector (RFS), Relief, Pearson coefficient (PCE) and Stacked learning classifiers (SLF). To reduce the dimension of the data features and to select the optimal feature sets, novel integration of RFS, Relief, PCE are deployed. As the final step, stacked classifiers are used for the classification of DoS attacks. All the trials in this framework were accompanied utilizing CICDDoS-2019 datasets and contrasted with the other similar models. The validation boundaries such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score are used to evaluate the proposed framework. With an F1-score of 96%, accuracy of 96.5%, precision of 96.0%, and recall of 95.8%, the suggested model obtained a CICDDoS-2019 score of 96%.

First, an improved (I, PSO)-fuzzy rough set model is proposed, which combines the covering-based fuzzy rough set (CFRS) and the variable precision fuzzy rough set (VPFRS). Second, inspired by the idea of attribute reduction, a novel method for determining attribute weights is introduced to optimize weight assignment in emergency decision-making. Last but not least, to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, an example of post-flood rescue force allocation in urban areas is demonstrated. Finally, the stability and superiority of the method are verified through sensitivity analysis and comparative evaluation.},

Traditional fatigue measurements may miss this complicated and ever-changing state, placing athletes at risk of injury while training. This study tests the premise that cutting-edge, real-time monitoring devices improve athlete health and performance. This research aims to reduce tiredness by developing a Fuzzy Decision Support System for Real-Time Athlete Weariness Monitoring. Fuzzy logic can handle unclear performance data, making it a more flexible and advanced alternative to standard methods. Sports athlete fatigue is complicated and dynamic, requiring improved, more precise, and real-time monitoring approaches. The FDSS-RAFM model uses fuzzy logic to account for human performance and physiology. The FDSS-RAFM model assesses athlete fatigue in a comprehensive and context-aware manner. This study’s findings can help coaches, players, and sports scientists improve training programs, reduce injury risk, and improve performance in ever-changing athletic contexts. Fuzzy decision-support systems and other cutting-edge technology can improve athletes’ health and performance, adding to sports science literature. Experimental results show that the proposed FDSS-RAFM model outperforms competing models in sensitivity (97%), specificity (89%), accuracy (96%), and dynamic adaptation error analysis (2.41%).},

Therefore, a search optimizer with a deep convolutional neural network coupled with a Deep Bidirectional long short-term memory classifier (SCN-Deep BiLSTM) is proposed to handle the abovementioned issue. The importance of SCN-Deep BiLSTM relies upon establishing the spatial information and temporal features from the ECG signals that support learning while minimizing the computational complexity associated with learning from raw signals.The SCN-Deep BiLSTM model achieves the accuracy, F-score, precision, recall, and critical success index of 0.97, 0.97, 0.98, 0.99, and 0.97, respectively for 80% of model training, whereas the SCN-Deep BiLSTM model attained 0.97, 0.98, 0.96, 0.94, and 0.96 for accuracy, F-score, precision, recall and critical success index, respectively when K-Fold is 10.

The proposed method extracts and classifies all the available teaching data to compute the students&#39; performance over sessions through fuzzy rough set differentiations over partial and complete derivatives. The complete derivatives identify the factors contributing the maximum to the teaching quality, while the partial derivatives acquire the minimal influence factors. These derivatives are clubbed together through the hierarchical process to identify the precise quality impacting factors and least impacting factors to replace or recommend alternate suggestions. The QAM-FST framework offers a comprehensive, data-driven assessment ensuring the enhancement of PE teaching quality. The QAM-FST outperforms three current models in terms of suggestion accuracy (96.8%), assessment time reduction (22.66%), and total performance evaluation efficiency (16.78%).

Therefore, a feature extraction algorithm for basketball players&#39; foul action based on attention mechanism is proposed. On the basis of ResNet50 network model, the attention mechanism is integrated to build a basketball player foul action feature extraction model. The machine vision system is used to obtain basketball player action video as the input of the model. The space attention module and time attention module are, respectively, introduced into the video slow frame rate branch and video fast frame rate branch of ResNet50 network. By making the network give greater weight to the key areas of a single frame of video, and improving the network&#39;s attention to important video frames, the best spatio-temporal characteristics of foul actions are obtained. After fusion, the feature fusion results are input into the classifier with the cross-entropy loss function as the loss function, and the probability value of each possible foul action and the tag target probability are output, complete basketball player foul action feature extraction. The experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively identify the identification of basketball players, the cumulative matching feature value of foul action recognition can reach more than 95%, and the average accuracy is more than 70%; the F1 value and stability are high, which can reduce the error caused by data fluctuation and noise; the error rate of real-time detection is less than 4.5%, the omission rate is less than 4.7%, the detection time is lower than 14 ms, and the application effect is good.},

Therefore to support such augmentation and consumer building process, this article proposes a filtered sale streaming model to improve the circulation of new launches and to project the existing products through sustainable promotions. In this process, the comprehensive transition rule for product promotions and sale improvements is defined using fuzzy mining. The fuzzy process introduces the different performance members based on consumer access rate and sale count. The rule modifications are defined using the above factors’ decrease over filtered promotions to boost the augmentation. Using the highest possible member weights over a product, sale, and consumers, the linear improvements between the three factors are estimated over the closure observed at each sale interval.

  abstract     = {Using energy storage to solve the multiperiod OPF problem for renewable energy fluctuation is an effective way to increase operation safety and reduce the cost of power systems. However, in solving this OPF problem, model-based methods cannot accurately model uncertain scenarios, while traditional RL methods cannot satisfy the constraints well, and both methods have limitations. Therefore, we propose an RL method, ERL-HC, that does not require scene modelling and can handle general forms of physical constraints. First, a constraint policy network (CPN) is proposed that corrects the output of a neural network on the basis of the inequality generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method; the outputs of this network satisfy all constraints, and it can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Second, the critic network is improved based on the IM method to increase the sample learning efficiency by improving the agent&#39;s understanding of state interdependencies. Finally, the adaptive-tuning Lagrange multiplier method is applied in the AC framework to reduce the number of iterations of the inequality GRG in the CPN and efficiently train ERL-HC. ERL-HC was tested on two systems of different sizes. The results show that ERL-HC has a better learning ability than general safe RL algorithms, overcomes the limitations of mainstream safe RL methods in handling equality constraints, and addresses the poor generalization issues of RL methods that can handle equality constraints.},

The results show that the top three indicators are Bird Prevention Funding ( $$D_3$$ ), Habitat Distribution ( $$C_1$$ ), and Dispersal Activities ( $$D_5$$ ).

  abstract     = {School operations have changed due to information technology. Personalized teaching for preschool children requires innovative and adaptable strategies for providing the best-afford experience and learning environment. Conventional teaching approaches may not always accommodate students’ learning styles. This can lower performance and involvement. The expanding variety of pre-schoolers necessitates creative evaluation and optimization methods that promote inclusion and success for all children. The article introduces a preschool teaching evaluation model to improve the students’ learning experience. In particular, the evaluation model is designed for various assessment strategies irrespective of personalization. The proposed model inputs the students’ learning feasibility and the teaching mode to evaluate the personalization adaptability. The fuzzy decision support system improves the evaluation based on the above factors. It evaluates student-specific indicators, including attentiveness, body language, and engagement, to determine instructional flexibility. The model uses real-time classroom observations and student assessments to find realistic approaches with low-to-high fuzzy derivatives. The proposed system is designed to compute the adaptability from both factors under low-to-high fuzzy derivatives. By defining the maximum feasibility range, the teaching strategy is optimized to meet the adaptability. Thus, the low-level strategies are discarded using adaptability measures to reduce personalization failures. The proposed model is verified using adaptability, feasibility, and mode improvements. Research shows that the fuzzy decision support system makes courses more adaptive and feasible in many contexts, particularly those that involve games, audiovisual approaches, and crafts. Preschoolers, parents, and teachers indicated increased enjoyment, fewer customization failures, and greater involvement. Fuzzy-based evaluation increased feasibility ratings and approach versatility. The research provides a valuable foundation for solving classroom customization difficulties in preschool settings, emphasizing data-driven, adaptive teaching techniques. This method enables scalable applications in early childhood education through fuzzy decision-making and real-time evaluations.},

  abstract     = {The manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm suffers from a fixed parameter $$ S $$ , limiting its adaptability in balancing search capability and convergence speed during different optimization stages. To address this limitation, a success-history-based parameter adaptation strategy is proposed to dynamically adjust $$ S $$ . Furthermore, to enhance population diversity and avoid premature convergence, a randomly selected individual from the top $$ G $$ high-quality solutions replaces the current best individual in the somersault foraging behavior. Based on these improvements, a parameter adaptive manta ray foraging optimization (PAMRFO) algorithm is developed. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAMRFO. On the IEEE CEC2017 benchmark function set, PAMRFO achieved an average win rate of 82.39% across 29 functions compared to seven state-of-the-art algorithms. On 22 IEEE CEC2011 real-world optimization problems, PAMRFO achieved an average win rate of 55.91% compared to ten advanced algorithms. Sensitivity analysis identified optimal parameter settings, and further stability analysis revealed that PAMRFO exhibits higher success rates and computational efficiency among the four MRFO variants. Population diversity and exploration-exploitation analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed update mechanism in maintaining diversity and balancing exploration and exploitation. In solving parameter estimation problems for six multimodal solar photovoltaic models, PAMRFO outperformed other competing methods with a 100% success rate, highlighting its superior performance in the photovoltaic field. These findings validate the robustness, efficiency, and wide applicability of PAMRFO, providing advanced solutions for optimization problems in the new energy domain.},

Owing to transmitting data through public channels, various security issues like identity leakage, man in the middle attack, key leakage and etc., are also introduced simultaneously and still challenging to be solved. Researches and practices have shown that authentication and key exchange protocols are effective methods to solve such security issues. However, most existing security protocols for Internet of Vehicles are established on the premise that the registration process is with a secure channel, which is usually not satisfied and deviates from practical applications. Accordingly, an authentication and key exchange protocol with an insecure channel has been proposed, in which the operations of symmetric encryption and XOR encryption are adopted for all interactive processes to improve protocol security. The theoretical analysis and formal verification demonstrate that the proposed protocol satisfies security properties including authentication and confidentiality, and reduces the costs of computation and communication compared with the method with public key encryption.},

  abstract     = {Fuel cells (FCs) are increasingly attracting attention for their efficient conversion of chemical energy into electricity without the need for combustion. Their high efficiency and versatility make them a promising technology across various applications. Researchers are actively exploring ways to optimize FC systems to meet specific energy needs. Among the different types of fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) stand out as a promising clean energy technology that generates electricity through electrochemical reactions. However, accurately modeling SOFCs, which is essential for reducing design costs, presents a challenge due to their complex and nonlinear characteristics. An ideal model should be adaptable to varying operating pressures and temperatures. This research introduces a novel approach for optimal SOFC model identification using a differential evolutionary mutation Fennec fox algorithm (DEMFFA). A real-world case study demonstrates the superior effectiveness of DEMFFA compared to existing methods. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis evaluates the influence of temperature and pressure on the model, with results indicating that the proposed method achieves higher efficiency than other approaches. The sum of the square error of the proposed algorithm is 1.18E-11 followed by the parent algorithm, Fennec fox algorithm (FFA) (1.24E-09), and some of the compared algorithms. The computational time of the proposed algorithm is 1.001 s, followed by the parent algorithm FFA (1.199 s) and some of the compared algorithms. DEMFFA offers significant potential, enhancing renewable energy, minimizing SOFC&#39;s environmental impact, and improving real-world applications like distributed power generation and hydrogen integration.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death. Therefore, early diagnosis of this cancer is crucial for planning patient treatment. This paper proposes a hybrid Lung Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (LECNN) architecture for the computer-aided early diagnosis of lung cancer via CT images. The proposed hybrid approach integrates a transfer learning (TL) mechanism with ensemble learning (EL) on the basis of majority voting. Initially, CNN architectures (GoogLeNet, EfficientNet, DarkNet19, and ResNet18) are trained via TL, and the resulting CNN models are used as inputs in EL. The outputs from all the CNN architectures are evaluated via majority voting to identify the top-performing triple CNN combination, which is then utilized in the hybrid approach. The performance of the proposed method was assessed via the widely used IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. Additionally, the impact of the elastic transformation method, a data augmentation technique, on performance improvement was investigated in the proposed method. The triple combination of the GoogLeNet, EfficientNet, and DarkNet19 CNN architectures, as part of the EL method in the hybrid approach, achieved superior performance on both the raw and augmented datasets according to the obtained performance results. The performance evaluations revealed that the proposed approach achieved more than a 5% improvement with the augmented dataset compared with the raw IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, resulting in the highest performance. The proposed hybrid approach achieved 99% accuracy, 98.82% sensitivity, 99.48% specificity, 99.06% precision, and 98.94% F1 score on the augmented IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. When compared with findings from previous studies using the same dataset, the proposed hybrid approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods. In conclusion, it demonstrates significant potential as a robust tool for computer-aided early lung cancer diagnosis systems and may also contribute to the development of future hybrid approaches in this field.},

  abstract     = {With the growth of the demand for wireless communication systems, when the existing algebraic model processes real-time data, the frequency adjustment is inflexible, it is difficult to quickly optimize the transmission parameters to cope with network load changes, and the long-term operation fails to effectively control the CPU frequency, resulting in increased energy consumption. To better promote the development of wireless communication systems, this article aimed to use aerial computing architecture to optimize the linear algebraic model of communication transmission frequency, to better meet the needs of today&#39;s wireless communication systems. The article first designed a communication frequency stabilization device structure to ensure high stability of the output spectrum. Then it introduced a dynamic frequency adjustment module to achieve real-time adjustment of communication transmission frequency. It then improved the data transmission rate through the design of the aerial computing perception module. This article used a frequency optimization algorithm based on linear algebra to adjust its linear relationship, optimize transmission energy consumption, and improve transmission efficiency. Finally, to verify the application effect of aerial computing architecture in optimizing the linear algebraic model of communication transmission frequency, this paper compared it with traditional dynamic adjustment models and parallel computational models. The research results showed that for packet 13, the round-trip time required to transmit the model in this article was 1.21 ms; the response time was 0.009 ms, and the total energy consumption was 89.6-W hours. The traditional dynamic adjustment model required a round-trip time of 4.92 ms, a response time of 0.093 ms, and a total energy consumption of 119.1-W hours for packet 13 transmissions. The parallel computational model required a round-trip time of 6.33 ms, a response time of 0.063 ms, and a total energy consumption of 131.4-W hours for packet 13 transmissions. The results showed that the optimized communication transmission frequency linear algebraic model using aerial computing architecture had shorter communication delay and response time, lower energy consumption, and better frequency control performance. This article highlighted the important impact of aerial computing architecture on the stability, real-time performance, and transmission rate of linear algebraic models of communication transmission frequencies, providing more ideas for the design and planning of wireless communication systems.},

Previous studies have used photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to identify arrhythmias, but there is limited research on their application for multiclass arrhythmia classification. This study introduces a Hybrid Deep Learning (HDL) model called DenseNet-ABiLSTM, which uses densely connected convolutional networks and Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (ABiLSTM) to categorize various types of arrhythmias. The model uses 1D convolutional kernels to acquire multiscale conceptual features, followed by BiLSTM to understand temporal relationships among features. The Attention Mechanism layer is presented to improve detection performance. The model categorizes arrhythmia rhythms into six types: Sinus Rhythm (SR), Early Ventricular Contraction (EVC), Early Atrial Contraction (EAC), Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), Supraventricular Tachycardia (ST), and AF. Various metrics were assessed and compared with Electrocardiogram (ECG) results to determine AM rhythms. The mean performance measures showed strong overall performance, with a mean F1 score and accuracy of 87.74% and 89.14%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The majority of daily networks and communications rely heavily on network security. Researchers in cybersecurity emphasize the necessity of developing effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) to safeguard networks. The importance of efficient IDS escalates as attackers devise new types of attacks and network volumes expand. Furthermore, IDS aims to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data transmitted across networked systems by preventing unauthorized access. Following numerous studies utilizing machine learning (ML) to develop effective IDS, the focus has shifted towards deep learning (DL) techniques as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and DL systems have become prevalent. ANNs are capable of generating features autonomously, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This paper introduces an innovative adaptive recurrent neural network-based fox optimizer (ARNN-FOX) method. The primary objective of the ARNN-FOX system is to efficiently detect and classify network intrusions, thereby enhancing network security. Data normalization is conducted to scale the incoming data into a usable format. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method is proposed for selecting the optimal subset of features for the ARNN-FOX method. In the proposed approach, the fox algorithm (FOX) is utilized for the adjustment of hyperparameters in the ARNN model. The efficacy of the ARNN-FOX approach is assessed using benchmark datasets. Based on comparative results, the ARNN-FOX method demonstrates superior performance in parameters such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1 Score, recall value, and precision values over existing models. The proposed ARNN-FOX-based IDS model for the network security in terms of accuracy is 15.12%, 8.79%, 6.45%, and 4.21% better than RNN, CNN-LSTM, DASO-RNN, and ChCSO-LSTM, respectively. Similarly, with respect to specificity, the suggested ARNN-FOX-based IDS model for network security outperforms RNN, CNN-LSTM, DASO-RNN, and ChCSO-LSTM by 32.43%, 8.89%, 3.16%, and 2.08%, respectively.},

This research proposes a novel fusion model for early GDM prediction. It uses conventional Machine Learning (ML) and advanced Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. Subsequently, it combines the strengths of both ML and DL algorithms using various ensemble techniques. It incorporates a meta-classifier that further reinforces its robust prediction performance. The dataset is split into training and testing sets in a 70/30 ratio. The initial steps involve exploratory analysis and data preprocessing techniques such as iterative imputation and feature engineering. Subsequently, oversampling is applied to the training set to address class imbalance which ensures the model learns effectively. The testing set remains imbalanced to maintain the credibility of the model’s performance evaluation. The fusion model achieves an accuracy of 98.21%, precision of 97.72%, specificity of 98.64%, recall of 97.47%, F1 score of 97.59%, and an Accuracy Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.91%.

Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques are utilized to interpret the model’s decisions.

  abstract     = {In the preliminary stages of public health emergencies, many regional public health systems do not have enough medical resources to address the needs that arise from the emergencies. Additionally, due to the rapid development of emergency situations, it is difficult to accurately understand all medical material demands. Thus, we develop a multi-category emergency medical materials robust scheduling method for multi-period, which continuously schedules the availability of multi-category emergency medical materials during times of uncertain demand. First, we developed a single-period Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) model to provide a powerful strategy for scheduling multi-category emergency medical materials with little information on material demand. In the DRO model, we prioritize medical material requirements into different categories, assuming only that the means and variances of information on the demand are available to seek an optimal implementation strategy in a single period. We then combine the DRO scheduling model with the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and extend it to the multi-period Distributionally Robust Optimization Markov Decision Process scheduling model (DRO-MDP). Our DRO-MDP model provides encouraging guidelines to solve the multi-period scheduling problem of multi-category emergency medical materials in uncertain situations. A simulated experiment is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The simulation uses COVID-19 data from New Delhi, India in the spring of 2021. It is important to note that the model we propose can be easily generalized as a framework for any multi-category resource allocation problem with uncertain needs.},

  abstract     = {Suspicious event detection (SED) identifies anomalous activities in surveillance data using computer vision and machine learning techniques. However, existing approaches have high false positive rates difficulty distinguishing suspicious from normal behaviors, and limited adaptability to dynamic environments. This research introduces a novel deep learning-based SED-NET model for detecting suspicious events in public places. Initially, input images are collected from two data for detecting Suspicious events. Surveillance camera videos are converted into frames and the suspicious images are pre-processed using a Gaussian adaptive bilateral filter (GABF) to reduce noise while preserving edges. A Sobel edge detector is used to detect the fine edges in the pre-processed frames for enhancing the structural details. Di-Stream Neural Network (DSNN) is introduced with the dual-branch EfficientNet-based feature extractor that retrieves both motion and pose features. The weighted Average Fusion method is used to combine pose and motion features to classify suspicious activities using the Simplified Spiking Neural Network (SSNN). The effectiveness of the proposed SED-NET method was evaluated using specificity, accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score. The proposed SED-NET model attains an accuracy of 98.97% for UCSD Pedestrian and 98.84% for CUHK Avenue datasets. Moreover, the proposed SED-NET improved the overall accuracy by 7.44%, 4.18%, and 2.73% better than DenseNet121, SegAD, and 3DCNN, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The hesitant fuzzy $$\beta $$ -covering rough set offers stronger representational capabilities than earlier hesitant fuzzy rough sets. Its flexibility makes it more suitable for hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). As a result, it has become a popular research focus in decision analysis and has drawn significant attention from scholars. However, the existing hesitant fuzzy $$\beta $$ -covering rough set based on t-norms cannot handle the overlap and correlation between hesitant information well. Addressing this problem, we propose the hesitant fuzzy overlap function and hesitant fuzzy $$\beta $$ -covering $$({\mathcal {I}},$$ $${\mathcal {O}})$$ rough set (HF $$\beta $$ CIORS) models based on the hesitant fuzzy overlap function. First, we establish the definition of the hesitant overlap function and representable hesitant fuzzy overlap function on a partial order relation. Based on proposed definitions, we provide examples of representable and unrepresentable hesitant fuzzy overlap functions and offer a detailed proof to explain the unrepresentable function. Second, we construct four types of HF $$\beta $$ CIORS models and prove some of its important properties. Thirdly, we integrate the HF $$\beta $$ CIORS models with the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method and apply them to solve MADM problems. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through a practical application, and its stability and effectiveness are confirmed via sensitivity and comparative analyses. Based on these validations, our method proves effective in addressing MADM problems, offering reliable decision-making support.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the foremost reasons behind the death of people worldwide. Prevention and early diagnosis are the only ways to control its progression and onset. Thus, there is an urgent need for a detection model comprising intelligent technologies, including Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning, to predict the future state of an individual suffering from cardiovascular disease by effectively analyzing patient data. This study aims to propose a hybrid model that provides a deep insight into the data under consideration to enhance model accuracy for effectively detecting cardiovascular disease. This current research proposes a hybrid model comprising four stages. In the first stage of the proposed hybrid model, the data imbalance problem is solved using a hybrid sampling technique named Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique-Edited Nearest Neighbors Rule. In the second stage, the Chi-square is applied as a feature selection method to select the highly relevant features from the records of 1190 with 11 clinical features, curated by combining the 5 most popular datasets, including Long Beach VA, Hungarian, Switzerland, and Statlog (Heart). In the third stage, the preprocessed dataset is passed to a stacking ensemble model comprising three base learners: Random Forest Tree (RFT), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), and AdaBoost classifier and one meta-learner: Logistic Regression (LR), optimized with Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV) optimization approach, whose performance is evaluated against individual classifier. In the fourth stage, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and ROC_AUC score.. The comparative results prove that the proposed hybrid model scored the highest accuracy of 97.8%, 96.15% sensitivity, and 96.75% specificity and 98.6% ROC_AUC score when compared with the existing techniques and models after applying the SMOTE–ENN (for data balancing) and Chi-square (for feature selection) methods for the efficient detection of cardiovascular disease. The implementation results demonstrate that the suggested hybrid model may accurately identify cardiovascular disease among patients. It facilitates the application of robust clinical treatment strategies.},

  abstract     = {In recent studies, several machine learning and deep learning prediction models have been proposed for the early detection and classification of various stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Many years before the actual onset of AD, there occur several structural changes in the brain. These structural brain features can be utilized in learning the disease progression from an early stage of the disease. The various stages of pathology cause mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal cognition and AD from normal cognition. This work intends to develop a weighted and hybrid random forest learning model that utilizes a relevant subset of predictors to diagnose the progression of the disease. The conversion from normal cognition to MCI is identified at an early stage of the onset of structural brain changes. The importance of proposed research works lies in more early identification of significant feature that increase disease progression and appropriate interventions greatly improve subjects’ recovery. The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuro Imaging Initiative (ADNI) cross-sectional MRI data were analyzed in this study that utilized brain curvature, grey matter density, white matter density, the volume of cortical and sub-cortical structures, shape of hippocampus, hippocampal subfield volume, Mini-mental state exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Estimated Total Intracranial Volume, Normalize Whole Brain Volume, and Atlas Scaling Factor for constructing randomized trees and thus predicting the features that cause the progression of disease stages from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease that causes dementia. Based on previous studies, there is a significant shortfall in understanding Alzheimer’s disease progression from pre-MCI stages and the classification of progressive and stable MCI groups. As a consequence of this challenge discussed, whether all the mild cognitively impaired people change to AD cohorts or remain in normal cognition and identification of the structural and functional features remains underexplored. Thus, the proposed Weighted Hybrid Random Forest algorithm (WHBM) utilized the 63 features that comprise the whole brain volume. The most significant and weighted features are derived which segregate 39% of subjects with cognitively progressive MCI and 51% of subjects with normal age-related cognitive decline. This implementation model proved to give robust AD conversion probability and identify significant features with 93% accuracy and 88% sensitivity that are sufficient for future clinical inferences. The optimized model thus resulted in the prediction of disease conversion probability from Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD because of significant structural features that are key-requisite for affected geriatric cohorts.},

However, the significant debt accumulated by these vehicles presents considerable long-term risks, including challenges to fiscal sustainability, threats to financial system stability, and disruptions to regional economic development. Timely monitoring of LGFV debt risks is essential for enabling effective interventions. This study develops a robust risk evaluation system for LGFVs by leveraging multi-source data and employing the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. We collected and analyzed a sample of 1584 Chinese LGFVs from a major state-owned bank. Through an examination of the mechanisms underlying LGFV debt risk and a review of relevant literature, we identified seven primary categories and 20 key risk indicators to construct our risk indicator system. After comparing several machine learning algorithms, we selected the RF algorithm to build the LGFV debt risk prediction model due to its superior performance. Our findings emphasize the External Guarantee Ratio, GDP growth rate, and proportion of the tertiary industry as critical risk indicators. The model evaluation demonstrates high accuracy, underscoring its significant potential for practical application. This study contributes to the management of local government debt risks and introduces a novel methodology with potential applicability in other areas of risk management.},

This method acquires the diagnosis, care-taking, and environmental factors validated using the two levels of FDS. The first FDS handles the quality improvement and the second deals with recommendations. From the previous patient suggestions/complaints, the quality improvements are performed such that the varying inputs result in high service recommendations. The first FDS and the overall recommendations (from patients) towards the above considerations are accounted for in the second fuzzification process. This consideration assimilates the service demands and is the highest patient response for retaining the same level. Therefore, the fuzzification performs the different condition verification in the second decision-making.

  abstract     = {Due to limited support in registered courses, students frequently struggle to complete their courses in higher education institutions. To combat this, educational systems are incorporating intelligent prediction tools to help students improve their academic performance by predicting their grades. Students&#39; demographic information, past performance in the subject, and course characteristics are some of the factors used by the grade prediction system to foretell how they will do in future. Complexity and non-linearity in the analysis of inter-variable connections pose problems for traditional prediction models. Our solution to these problems is a GGCNN, or Genetic Algorithm with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. In order to improve the accuracy of predictions, GGCNN examines educational data and finds intricate linkages. Using a graph structure, the graph convolution model emphasizes the interdependencies among academic metrics, course features, and student performance. Relationships and correlations can be better predicted with the use of this dependency metric. Use of the genetic algorithm improves the grade prediction system by optimizing the network and making better use of features. Administrators and teachers alike can find ways to boost their kids&#39; grades through the optimization process. To test how well the system performs on different measures, we utilize the Student Performance Kaggle dataset. This continues until the convergence requirements are satisfied. With Python as its implementation, the system was able to get an accuracy of 0.98% after 100 epochs and 0.97% after 1000 epochs.},

  abstract     = {A Tenant Virtual Machine (TVM) user in the cloud may misuse its computing power to launch malware attack against other tenant VMs, Host OS, Hypervisor, or any other computing devices/resources inside the cloud environment of a Cloud Service Provider. The security solutions deployed within the TVM may not be reliable, as malware can disable them or remain undetected due to its hidden nature. Therefore, security solutions deployed outside the virtual machine are necessary. This research proposes deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) at the Hypervisor layer, utilizing time series system call data and employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately detect the presence of malicious (malware) computer programs within virtual machines. The raw VMM system call traces are transformed into novel Time Series System Call patterns and utilized by a deep learning algorithm for training and building the classifier model. A deep learning model, CNN, is used to build the classifier model for detecting intrusions with high accuracy. It is capable of detecting both known and unknown malware. The CNN model is compared with machine learning algorithms for the results and discussions, and it outperforms ML algorithms in terms of intrusion detection accuracy when utilizing novel time series system call data..},

  abstract     = {In today’s world, cancer stands out as one of the most perilous diseases, caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of cells within the human body. Early detection is paramount to ensuring that patients receive the necessary medical intervention in a timely manner. Recently, deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks, have proven to be incredibly effective in developing computer-aided diagnosis systems due to their remarkable accuracy in analyzing medical images. However, the process of training these neural networks from scratch is often complex and requires significant computational resources. Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful solution to overcome this challenge. This study examines the fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic systems. It underscores the significant role of transfer learning in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. It also illustrates the various transfer learning models employed to diagnose various cancer forms, including skin cancer, brain tumors, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and cervical cancer.

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network of interconnected physical objects that has improved the conditions for a computer-based physical world and improved efficiency. With the increase in communication in an IoT system, Internet security has decreased, and the most dangerous and sophisticated attacks in the IoT have emerged, i.e., DDoS and Botnet attacks. DDoS attacks are a serious threat to the availability of Internet services, especially since botnets can now be launched by almost anyone. In this situation, the use of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to detect intruders and maintain the security of IoT networks. In this paper, a new IDS is proposed to detect IoT-Botnet DDoS attacks. This IDS is a new three-phase system, the first phase is related to preprocessing on the dataset and the second phase includes a new hybrid method for feature selection using filter and wrapper methods based on the Grey Wolf (GW) algorithm and genetics called GW-GA. In this method, the initial population is randomly selected and then at each stage, feature selection is done by both algorithms simultaneously and the final answer is compared and the best solutions are given as a new population to both algorithms and the third phase includes the use of machine learning and metaheuristic algorithms as classifiers. In the proposed method and to verify the performance, it is evaluated using the large BOT-IoT dataset. The results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the feature and also increases the classification accuracy compared to other methods, and the RF and Bagging algorithms have achieved a maximum recognition accuracy of 0.999. The dimensions of BOT-IoT have been reduced from 46 features to 12.},

  abstract     = {Credit risk assessment uses finance-based behavioural patterns for micro-lending purposes and organizations. The repayment behaviour and credit stability patterns are analyzed across varying repayment tenures and financed amounts. Due to limited borrower data and fluctuating financial patterns, micro-lending platforms have substantial hurdles when it comes to effectively evaluating credit risk. This article introduces a Collaborative Filtering Method using Lending Pattern Analysis (CFM-LPA). The proposed method is enhanced through collaborative federated learning, enabling the analysis of these patterns. This approach evaluates the return rate, credit limit, and consumer response behaviours. Federated learning processes one or more of these factors to assess diverse lending patterns. Based on these evaluations, the behavioural factor is updated for each return period, influencing the credit risk for subsequent return periods and supporting the financial stability of micro-lending operations. The model is trained individually on the identified factors, allowing the behavioural factor to be filtered. New credit risks are identified using this filtered factor from the previous return period. These insights help define new behavioural patterns for the specified credit limit. The proposed method enhances risk detection accuracy by 14.03% and improves return rate analysis by 13.28% across financed amounts. The above abstract is also graphically presented.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumor incidence and mortality rates are increasing due to unique location and treatment challenges. Early detection, robust diagnosis, and prompt treatment are crucial for better clinical evaluations. However, traditional neural network-based diagnostic methods often overlook issues such as variation in multimodality information, loss of spatial information, and under-utilization of boundary information. This study presents the Multi-View Coupled Cross-Modal Attention Network (MSegNet), a novel Transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates cross-modal attention mechanisms and a multi-view architecture. MSegNet is designed to exploit multimodal MRI data’s spatial and depth dimensions, effectively capturing nuanced intermodal relationships and modeling long-range dependencies. The proposed framework also employs three data augmentation methods, which help prevent overfitting and improve the performance of segmentation network training, enhancing the model’s robustness and generalizability. The proposed model is validated using BraTS2019, BraTS2020 and Figshate brain datasets and is compared against three state-of-the-art 3D segmentation networks. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analyses, highlight MSegNet’s robust performance. The dice scores for the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC) and enhancing tumor (ET) regions improved by 13. 96%, 12. 39%, and 11. 83%, respectively, while the Hausdorff distances were reduced by 3.64 mm, 2.98 mm, and 14.72 mm. These results demonstrate the model’s efficacy in enhancing segmentation precision, making it a valuable tool for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.},

This study proposes the RT-DETR-improved model to overcome these issues based on the real-time detection transformer (RT-DETR). First, we incorporate the high-low frequency (HiLo) attention into the encoder, therefore enhancing the model’s detection performance. Furthermore, we present a nonlinear feature fusion module that fuses information from various feature scales and contexts more successfully. We also introduce a novel loss function, InnerMPDIoU, to enhance detection efficacy in congested environments. To evaluate our model’s performance, extensive experiments are conducted on the CityPersons dataset. Compared to the baseline model, the RT-DETR-improved model attains a 4.2% enhancement in mAP50, a 2.0% improvement in mAP, a 2.2% rise in accuracy, and a 3.1% gain in recall.

  abstract     = {The Distributed Permutation Flow-Shop Scheduling Problem (DPFSP) is a classic issue in distributed scheduling that involves job allocation and processing order within a factory, and it is known to be NP-hard. Numerous researchers have proposed various intelligent optimization algorithms to address the DPFSP; however, there are fewer studies related to the multi-objective DPFSP problem, and the algorithms for solving this problem also suffer from poor solution quality and tend to fall into local optimization and so on. To tackle the multi-objective DPFSP, this paper proposes a novel hybrid differential evolutionary algorithm aimed at minimizing both the maximum completion time and total delay time. In this algorithm, Bernoulli chaotic mapping is applied during the population initialization process to enhance the diversity of the initial population. Additionally, an adaptive mutation factor and crossover rate are designed to balance the global and local search capabilities of the algorithm. Furthermore, a novel selection strategy is constructed based on the NEH algorithm, specular reflection learning, and Pareto dominance relation to improve the quality of the solution set when solving instances of varying sizes. This strategy enhances the algorithm&#39;s optimization ability and helps it escape local optima. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are verified through 24 instances of different sizes. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other improved algorithms in terms of convergence, and the uniformity and diversity of the solution set, making it an effective solution for the multi-objective distributed permutation flow-shop scheduling problem.},

Drawing upon the cascade failure theory in complex networks, we employ the BA scale-free network model to construct an industrial cluster innovation network. We develop a cascade propagation model for collaborative innovation risk, addressing three dimensions: risk load, risk capacity, and load redistribution following node failures. To enhance the model, we propose a risk load distribution strategy that considers the heterogeneity among innovation entities, focusing on the similarity degree, importance degree, and cooperation degree of neighboring innovative entities. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the integrated allocation strategy significantly improves the resistance to destruction of industrial cluster innovation networks. However, under intentional attacks, the resilience of these networks remains relatively weak. Further investigation reveals that the risk load capacity enhanced by the integrated allocation strategy can somewhat fortify the resistance of industrial cluster innovation networks to such attacks. The findings offer valuable insights for risk management and stability enhancement in industrial cluster innovation networks.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance image (MRI) is the primary diagnostic test used clinically for the diagnosis and assessment of a wide range of diseases. In recent years, many studies have employed artificial intelligence techniques for MRI segmentation. Deep learning methods have demonstrated potential to enhance segmentation performance. However, they still face two challenges: annotation scarcity and domain shift. The annotation of MRI is both challenging and costly, and well-annotated datasets are scarce and valuable. Moreover, due to variations in MRI machines, ensuring the independence and identical distribution between model training data and real-world data is difficult, which may lead to noisy model predictions and weak generalization ability. We aim to address the challenges through a multi-pronged approach. First, we propose a method that integrates confidence and uncertainty for generating reliable pseudo-labels. Second, we introduce a consistency learning method that employs self-perturbation at both the image and feature levels to encourage the learning of more generalized feature representations. Finally, we optimize pseudo-labels end-to-end with the teacher–student framework. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on six different MRI segmentation datasets. The results showed that our method was superior to the existing methods in DSC, ASD and HD95 metrics. In addition, we evaluated the quality and quantity of the generated pseudo-labels, and the results showed that our method generated better pseudo-labels than other methods. Overall, our proposed method shows promising potential in assisting clinicians in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) framework integrates multiple heuristic components to solve Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems through synergistic cooperation. Understanding the characteristics of these components in the underlying architecture provides crucial insights for designing corresponding methods to enhance the performance of CDCL solvers. Although numerous studies from diverse perspectives have been conducted, there remains a need to develop efficient methods and algorithms to meet the requirements for enhancing the performance efficiency of SAT solving. In this paper, we introduced two fundamental innovations: deep restart, a strategic reset mechanism that clears variable activity states while preserving learned clauses and making phase randomization, and assignment coverage time (CoverT), a novel metric quantifying the minimum—conflict count required to assign all variables at least once during search exploration. The CoverT metric provided unique insight into the characteristics of the instance structure, allowing dynamic adaptation of branching heuristics in our proposed Deep Restart-Enhanced Conflict-Driven Clause Learning algorithm framework (DR-CDCL). Experimental validation in 2021–2023 SAT Competition benchmarks demonstrated statistically significant improvements: Notably, the performance trade-off analysis revealed that while deep restart enhances solution diversity for satisfiable instances, it introduced a 2.1% overhead on unsatisfiable proofs due to clause learning pattern disruption, a phenomenon requiring further investigation. This work advances solver architecture design by establishing formal connections between exploratory search patterns and instance structural complexity. The implemented solution prototype and benchmark data are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.},
