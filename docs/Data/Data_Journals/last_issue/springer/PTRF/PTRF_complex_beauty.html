  abstract     = {We consider the Glauber dynamics of a ferromagnetic Ising-Kac model on a three-dimensional periodic lattice of size $$(2 N + 1)^3$$ , in which the flipping rate of each spin depends on an average field in a large neighborhood of radius $$\gamma ^{-1}&lt;\!\!&lt; N$$ . We study the random fluctuations of a suitably rescaled coarse-grained spin field as $$N \rightarrow \infty $$ and $$\gamma \rightarrow 0$$ ; we show that near the mean-field value of the critical temperature, the process converges in distribution to the solution of the dynamical $$\Phi ^4_3$$ model on a torus. Our result settles a conjecture from Giacomin et al. (1999). The dynamical $$\Phi ^4_3$$ model is given by a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) which is driven by an additive space-time white noise and which requires renormalisation of the non-linearity. A rigorous notion of solution for this SPDE and its renormalisation is provided by the framework of regularity structures (Hairer in Invent Math 198(2):269–504, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00222-014-0505-4 ). As in the two-dimensional case (Mourrat and Weber in Commun Pure Appl Math 70(4):717–812, 2017), the renormalisation corresponds to a small shift of the inverse temperature of the discrete system away from its mean-field value.},

  abstract     = {We study the regularity of the law of a quadratic form Q(X, X), evaluated in a sequence $$X = (X_{i})$$ of independent and identically distributed random variables, when $$X_{1}$$ can be expressed as a sufficiently smooth function of a Gaussian field. This setting encompasses a large class of important and frequently used distributions, such as, among others, Gaussian, Beta, for instance uniform, Gamma distributions, or else any polynomial transform of them. Let us present an emblematic application. Take $$X = (X_{i})$$ a sequence of independent and identically distributed centered random variables, with unit variance, following such distribution. Consider also $$(Q_{n})$$ a sequence of quadratic forms, with associated symmetric Hilbert–Schmidt operators $$({\textsf{A}}^{(n)})$$ . Assume that $${{\,\textrm{Tr}\,}}[ ({\textsf{A}}^{(n)})^{2} ] = 1/2$$ , $${\textsf{A}}^{(n)}_{ii} =0$$ , and the spectral radius of $${\textsf{A}}^{(n)}$$ tends to 0. Then, $$(Q_{n}(X))$$ converges in a strong sense to the standard Gaussian distribution. Namely, all derivatives of the densities, which are well-defined for n sufficiently large, converge uniformly on $$\mathbb {R}$$ to the corresponding derivatives of the standard Gaussian density. While classical methods, from Malliavin calculus or $$\Gamma $$ -calculus, generally consist in bounding negative moments of the so-called carré du champ operator $$\Gamma (Q(X),Q(X))$$ , we provide a new paradigm through a second-order criterion involving the eigenvalues of a Hessian-type matrix related to Q(X). This Hessian is built by iterating twice a tailor-made gradient, the sharp operator $$\sharp $$ , obtained via a Gaussian representation of the carré du champ. We believe that this method, recently developed by the authors in the current paper and Herry et al. (Ann Probab 52(3):1162–1200, 2024), is of independent interest and could prove useful in other settings.},

We show that under the assumption that the critical FK percolation converges to a conformally invariant scaling limit (which is known to hold for the FK-Ising model,i.e. $$q=2$$ ), the obtained coloring converges to variants of Conformal Loop Ensembles constructed, described and studied by Miller, Sheffield and Werner. Based on discrete considerations, we also show that the arm exponents for this coloring in the discrete model are identical to the ones of the continuum model.

Various properties of the associated semigroup and the asymptotics of the expected stopping time for Lévy flight based random searches for small targets, also known as the “narrow capture problem&quot;, are then obtained using our newfound understanding of the infinitesimal generator. Our study also relates to the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis in the field of biology as we compute the expected time for finding a small target by using the Lévy flight random search. Compared to the random search time for Brownian motion on surfaces done in Nursultanov et al. ( arXiv:2209.12425 ), our result suggests that Lévy flight may not always be the optimal strategy, consistent with the conclusion obtained in Palyulin et al.

It has been conjectured that this statistical-computation gap is fundamental, and moreover that the optimal accuracy achievable by polynomial-time estimators coincides with the accuracy achieved by certain approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms. We provide evidence towards this conjecture by proving that no estimator in the (broader) class of constant-degree polynomials can surpass AMP.},

Our construction relies on a rearranged version of the stochastic heat equation on the circle driven by a coloured noise. Formally, this stochastic equation writes as a reflected equation in infinite dimension. Under the action of the rearrangement, the solution is forced to live in a space of quantile functions that is isometric to the space of probability measures on the real line. We prove the equation to be solvable by means of an Euler scheme in which we alternate flat dynamics in the space of random variables on the circle with a rearrangement operation that projects back the random variables onto the subset of quantile functions. A first challenge is to prove that this scheme is tight. A second one is to provide a consistent theory for the limiting reflected equation and in particular to interpret in a relevant manner the reflection term. The last step in our work is to establish the aforementioned Lipschitz property of the semigroup by adapting earlier ideas from the Bismut–Elworthy–Li formula.},
