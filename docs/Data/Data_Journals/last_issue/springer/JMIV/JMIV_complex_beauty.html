Specifically, we incorporate the curvature prior into the traditional variational model to guide the evolution in the direction that maintains the curvature information. Theoretically, we investigate the properties of the proposed model and give a detailed discussion based on the mathematical foundation about the existence of the solution. Numerically, we formulate an effective and efficient algorithm to solve the proposed minimization problem based on the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model is better than that of other testing methods for several testing color images.},

In this manuscript, the axial symmetry of 2D star-shaped sets is analyzed. For such a purpose, different measures of axial symmetry of a star-shaped set are proposed and the concept of a best symmetry axis is also introduced. By means of them, families of symmetry measures for star-shaped sets quantifying the degree of symmetry of a set of that class are introduced. All of them are discussed in detail, providing their main properties and the existence of at least a best axis of symmetry, which could be not unique, for any star-shaped set. Some examples illustrate the concepts and results of the manuscript.},

  abstract     = {We devise an L-BFGS method for optimization problems in which the objective is the sum of two functions, where the Hessian of the first function is computationally unavailable while the Hessian of the second function has a computationally available approximation that allows for cheap matrix–vector products. This is a prototypical setting for many inverse problems. The proposed L-BFGS method exploits the structure of the objective to construct a more accurate Hessian approximation than in standard L-BFGS. In contrast with existing works on structured L-BFGS, we choose the first part of the seed matrix, which approximates the Hessian of the first function, as a diagonal matrix rather than a multiple of the identity. We derive two suitable formulas for the coefficients of the diagonal matrix and show that this boosts performance on real-life image registration problems, which are highly non-convex inverse problems. The new method converges globally and linearly on non-convex problems under mild assumptions in a general Hilbert space setting, making it applicable to a broad class of inverse problems. An implementation of the method is freely available.},

Unlike conventional methodologies that depend on total variation-based penalty functions, our model represents cartoon images using an edge-preserving WLS penalty. This approach effectively enhances edges and suppresses texture through iterative updates of an edge-preserving weight matrix. For the texture component, we introduce a low-rank penalty function to capture the structured regularity of texture patterns. By leveraging the repetitive nature of texture, our low-rank models can accurately represent these components. We employ a prediction–correction approach based on a three-block separable alternating direction multiplier method to solve the minimization problem, providing closed-form solutions for all subproblems. We also provide a convergence proof for the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method in successfully separating cartoon and texture components while preserving edges.},

A new family of fuzzy shape-based measures ranges the interval (0, 1] where a maximum value equal to 1 is reached if and only if the shape under consideration is a fuzzy disk. This family is theoretically well grounded having the behavior that corresponds to human perception and can be predicted in advance. Additionally, a new family of fuzzy shape-based measures is invariant to rotation, translation, and scaling of the considered fuzzy shape. Various experiments on both synthetically generated and real images are included to provide a better understanding of the behavior of the new measures and to confirm the theoretically proven results. The performance of the new family of fuzzy circularity is extensively tested on several standard, well-known image datasets such as MPEG-7 CE-1, Animal, Swedish Leaf, and Galaxy Zoo datasets. Experimental evaluations also illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the new shape descriptors in various object classification and recognition tasks by comparing them with other known analysis approaches.},

  abstract     = {Blind image deconvolution is a challenging issue in image processing. In blind image deconvolution, the typical approach involves iteratively estimating both the blur kernel and latent image until convergence to the blur kernel of the observed image is achieved. Recently, several approaches have been attempted to develop a sophisticated regularization to obtain the clean image. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively handle ringing artifacts and local blur. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fractional-order variational model. This model alleviates the ringing artifacts through the selection of an optimal derivative. Subsequently, to refine the latent image further, we leverage the local prior, namely patch-wise minimal pixels (PMP) prior. Since the PMP prior of clean images blocks is much sparser than that of blurred ones, it is capable of discriminating between clean and blurred image blocks. We illustrate the effective integration of the fractional-order operations and the PMP prior within our proposed approach. Moreover, the convergence of our algorithm has been proved as the values of the objective function monotonically decrease. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with other methods in terms of reconstruction quality for blind deconvolution.},

Until now, mainly Euclidean colour spaces have been considered in this context, but recent years have seen a renewed interest in and importance of non-Euclidean colour geometry. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of the equations for anisotropic diffusion in Riemannian colour geometry. It is demonstrated that it contains several well-known solutions such as Perona–Malik diffusion and Tschumperlé–Deriche diffusion as special cases. Furthermore, it is shown how it is non-trivially connected to Sochen’s general framework for low-level vision. The main significance of the method is that it decouples the coordinates used for solving the diffusion equation from the ones that define the metric of the colour manifold, and thus directs the magnitude and direction of the diffusion through the diffusion tensor. It also enables the use of non-Euclidean colour manifolds and metrics for applications such as denoising, inpainting, and demosaicing, based on anisotropic diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Full convexity has been recently proposed as an alternative definition of digital convexity in $$\mathbb {Z}^n$$ . In contrast to classical definitions, fully convex sets are always connected and even simply connected whatever the dimension, while remaining digitally convex in the usual sense. In order to better understand the properties of full convexity, we present here two new and radically different characterizations of full convexity. The first one mimics the usual continuous convexity via segments inclusion. We show an equivalence of full convexity with this segment convexity in dimensions 1 and 2, and counterexamples starting from dimension 3. If we now ask that the cells touched by all d-simplices (instead of just 2-simplices aka segments) are within the cells touched by the digital set, we achieve an equivalence in arbitrary dimension d. The second characterization is recursive with respect to the dimension and relies on convexity of its axis-aligned projections. We provide several applications of these characterizations: the full convexity of balls and subsets of the hypercube, a natural measure of full convexity for digital sets, a new and faster algorithm to check the full convexity of digital sets. Finally, we study the main drawback of full convexity: Its envelope operator may not be an increasing operator. We characterize fully convex sets that have anti-monotonous subsets, and we show that they must be thin in a precise sense.},

In particular, we show that the problem of determining the epipole has at most four distinct real solutions when the left image plane is parallel to a certain face of the tetrahedron consisting of four control points.
