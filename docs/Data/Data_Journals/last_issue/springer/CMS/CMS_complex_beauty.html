  abstract     = {Motivated by the need of modeling and inference for high-order integer-valued threshold time series models, this paper introduces a pth-order two-regime self-excited threshold integer-valued autoregressive (SETINAR(2, p)) model. Basic probabilistic and statistical properties of the model are discussed. The parameter estimation problem is addressed by means of conditional least squares and conditional maximum likelihood methods. The asymptotic properties of the estimators, including the threshold parameter, are obtained. A method to test the nonlinearity of the underlying process is provided. Some simulation studies are conducted to show the performances of the proposed methods. Finally, an application to the number of people suffering from meningococcal disease in Germany is provided.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a stochastic geometric iterative method (S-GIM) to approximate the high-resolution 3D models by finite loop subdivision surfaces. Given an input mesh as the fitting target, the initial control mesh is generated using the mesh simplification algorithm. Then, our method adjusts the control mesh iteratively to make its finite loop subdivision surface approximate the input mesh. In each geometric iteration, we randomly select part of points on the subdivision surface to calculate the difference vectors and distribute the vectors to the control points. Finally, the control points are updated by adding the weighted average of these difference vectors. We prove the convergence of S-GIM and verify it by demonstrating error curves in the experiment. In addition, compared with existing geometric iterative methods, S-GIM has a shorter running time under the same number of iteration steps.},

  abstract     = {Case–cohort studies are commonly used in various investigations, and many methods have been proposed for their analyses. However, most of the available methods are for right-censored data or assume that the censoring is independent of the underlying failure time of interest. In addition, they usually apply only to a specific model such as the Cox model that may often be restrictive or violated in practice. To relax these assumptions, we discuss regression analysis of interval-censored data, which arise more naturally in case–cohort studies than and include right-censored data as a special case, and propose a two-step inverse probability weighting estimation procedure under a general class of semiparametric transformation models. Among other features, the approach allows for informative censoring. In addition, an EM algorithm is developed for the determination of the proposed estimators and the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. Simulation results indicate that the approach works well for practical situations and it is applied to a HIV vaccine trial that motivated this investigation.},

  abstract     = {Many data that exhibit asymmetrical behavior can be well modeled with skew-normal random errors. Moreover, data that arise from a heterogeneous population can be efficiently analyzed by a finite mixture of regression models. These observations motivate us to propose a novel finite mixture of mode regression model based on a mixture of the skew-normal distributions to explore asymmetrical data from several subpopulations. Thanks to the stochastic representation of the skew-normal distribution, we construct a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework and then develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to generate posterior samples for obtaining the Bayesian estimates of the unknown parameters and their corresponding standard errors. Simulation studies and a real-data example are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed Bayesian methodology.},

Given that sure independence screening (SIS) method by marginal Pearson’s correlation learning may omit some important observation variables due to measurement errors, a corrected SIS called EVSIS is proposed to rank the importance of features according to their corrected marginal correlation with the response variable. Also, a corrected error variance procedure is proposed to accurately estimate the error variance, which could greatly attenuate the influence of measurement errors and spurious correlations, simultaneously. Under some regularization conditions, the proposed EVSIS possesses sure screening property and consistency in ranking and the corrected error variance estimator is also proved to be asymptotically normal. The two methodologies are illustrated by some simulations and a real data example, which suggests that the proposed methods perform well.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian process (GP) is a stochastic process that has been successfully applied in finance, black-box modeling of biosystems, machine learning, geostatistics, multitask learning or robotics and reinforcement learning. Effectively estimating the spectral density function (SDF) and degree of memory (DOM) of a long-memory stationary GP (LMSGP) is needed to get accurate information about the process. The practice demonstrated that the periodogram estimator (PE) and lag window estimator (LWE) that are the extremely used estimators of the SDF and DOM have some drawbacks, especially for LMSGPs. The behaviors of the PEs and LWEs are soundly investigated numerically; however, the theoretical justifications are limited and thus the challenge to improve them is still daunting. This paper gives a closer look at the theoretical justifications of the efficiency of the LWEs that provides new sufficient conditions (NSCs) for improving the LWEs of the SDF and DOM for LMSGPs. The precision, the convergence rate of the bias and variance, and the asymptotic distributions of the LWEs under the NSCs are studied. A comparison study among the LWEs under the NSCs, the LWEs without the NSCs and the PEs is given to investigate the significance of the NSCs. The main theoretical and simulation results show that: the LWEs under the NSCs are asymptotically unbiased and consistent and better than the LWEs without the NSCs and the PEs, and the asymptotic distributions of the LWEs under the NSCs are chi-square for SDF and normal for DOM.},

  abstract     = {A 3D T-mesh is generally a cuboid grid which allows hanging vertices. Here, a hanging vertex is an interior vertex, but it is not a corner point of eight cells. Spline function spaces with high order smoothness over 3D T-meshes have great application prospect due to their local refinement and relatively low degrees of freedom, for example, 3D isogeometric analysis and implicit representation of surfaces. However, there are still no available dimension formulae of those kinds of spline spaces for application. In this paper, we explore the dimensions of trivariate quadratic spline spaces with $$ C^1 $$ continuity over hierarchical 3D T-meshes. By using space embedding method, the problem is converted into a system of linear constraints, and then a lower bound on the dimension of the spline space over a hierarchical 3D T-mesh is provided. For a special type of hierarchical 3D T-meshes, the explicit dimension formula is obtained. In addition, a topological explanation of the dimension is given, which presents a way to construct basis functions.},
