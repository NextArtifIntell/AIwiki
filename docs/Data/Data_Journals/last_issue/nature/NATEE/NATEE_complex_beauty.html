  abstract     = {A pressing question resulting from global warming is how climate change will affect infectious diseases. Answering this question requires research into the effects of weather on the population dynamics of transmission and infection; elucidating these effects, however, has proved difficult due to the challenges of assessing causality from the predominantly observational data available in epidemiological research. Here we show how concepts from causal inference—the sub-field of statistics aiming at inferring causality from data—can guide that research. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how such concepts can help assess study design and strategically choose a study’s location, evaluate and reduce the risk of bias, and interpret the multifaceted effects of meteorological variables on transmission. More broadly, we argue that interdisciplinary approaches based on explicit causal frameworks are crucial for reliably estimating the effect of weather and accurately predicting the consequences of climate change. A series of case studies is used to illustrate how concepts from causal interference can be used to guide research into the effects of weather on the transmission and population dynamics of infectious diseases.},

  abstract     = {Our understanding of animal ornaments and the mating preferences driving their exaggeration is limited by knowledge of their genetics. Post-copulatory sexual selection is credited with the rapid evolution of female sperm-storage organ morphology and corresponding sperm quality traits across diverse taxa. In Drosophila, the mechanisms by which longer flagella convey an advantage in the competition among sperm for limited storage space in the female, and by which female sperm-storage organ morphology biases fertilization in favour of longer sperm have been resolved. However, the evolutionary genetics underlying this model post-copulatory ornament and preference system have remained elusive. Here we combined comparative analyses of 149 Drosophila species, a genome-wide association study in Drosophila melanogaster and molecular evolutionary analysis of ~9,400 genes to elucidate how sperm and female sperm-storage organ length co-evolved into one of nature’s most extreme ornaments and preferences. Our results reveal a diverse repertoire of pleiotropic genes linking sperm length and seminal receptacle length expression to central nervous system development and sensory biology. Sperm length development appears condition-dependent and is governed by conserved hormonal (insulin/insulin-like growth factor) and developmental (including Notch and Fruitless) pathways. Central developmental pathway genes, including Notch, also comprised the majority of a restricted set of genes contributing to both intraspecific and interspecific variation in sperm length. Our findings support ‘good genes’ models of female preference evolution. A comparative analysis of morphological data across 149 species of Drosophilidae shows that sperm length in males has co-evolved with the length of the sperm-storage organ in females. Combining a genome-wide association study of these traits in Drosophila melanogaster with molecular evolutionary analyses of the genomes of 15 Drosophila species, the authors find that the genetic architecture underlying sperm length is associated with indirect genetic benefits in females, providing support for the ‘good genes’ hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {The probability of parallel genetic evolution is a function of the strength of selection and constraints imposed by genetic architecture. Inversions capture locally adapted alleles and suppress recombination between them, which limits the range of adaptive responses. In addition, the combined phenotypic effect of alleles within inversions is likely to be greater than that of individual alleles; this should further increase the contributions of inversions to parallel evolution. We tested the hypothesis that inversions contribute disproportionately to parallel genetic evolution in independent dune ecotypes of Helianthus petiolaris. We analysed habitat data and identified variables underlying parallel habitat shifts. Genotype–environment association analyses of these variables indicated parallel responses of inversions to shared selective pressures. We also confirmed larger seed size across the dunes and performed quantitative trait locus mapping with multiple crosses. Quantitative trait loci shared between locations fell into inversions more than expected by chance. We used whole-genome sequencing data to identify selective sweeps in the dune ecotypes and found that the majority of shared swept regions were found within inversions. Phylogenetic analyses of shared regions indicated that within inversions, the same allele typically was found in the dune habitat at both sites. These results confirm predictions that inversions drive parallel divergence in the dune ecotypes. Analysis of habitat data, quantitative trait locus mapping of seed size and selective sweeps show parallel selection acting on inversions in two independent dune ecotypes of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris.},

  abstract     = {Environmental filtering and dispersal history limit plant distributions and affect biogeographical patterns, but how their relative importance varies across evolutionary timescales is unresolved. Phylogenetic beta diversity quantifies dissimilarity in evolutionary relatedness among assemblages and might help resolve the ecological and biogeographical mechanisms structuring biodiversity. Here, we examined the effects of environmental dissimilarity and geographical distance on phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover for ~270,000 seed plant species globally and across evolutionary timescales. We calculated past and present dispersal barriers using palaeogeographical reconstructions and calculated geographical linear and least-cost distances, accounting for dispersal over water, mountains or areas with unsuitable climates. Environmental dissimilarity and geographical distance jointly explained most of the deviance in taxonomic (up to 86.4%) and phylogenetic turnover (65.6%). While environmental dissimilarity consistently showed strongly positive effects, the effect of geographical distance on phylogenetic turnover was less pronounced further back in evolutionary time. Past physiogeographical barriers explained a relatively low amount of the variation across all timescales, with a slight peak at intermediate timescales (20–50 Myr bp). Our results suggest that while old lineages have generally dispersed widely, the imprint of environmental filtering on range expansion persists, providing insights into biogeographical and evolutionary processes underlying global biodiversity patterns. This modelling study integrates comprehensive regional plant inventories, environmental conditions and palaeogeographical reconstructions to assess the relative roles of environmental filtering and dispersal barriers in shaping global seed plant diversity, demonstrating that environmental filtering has a persistent effect on species distribution patterns across evolutionary timescales.},

While previous studies have often examined the extreme scenario of complete pollinator removal, showing negative impacts on plant reproductive success, we take a more realistic approach by focusing on the effects of decreasing pollinator diversity. Our global meta-analysis reveals a notable negative impact of reduced pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success measures, such as seed set, fruit set and fruit weight. Notably, this effect varies across plant families, impacting both self-incompatible and self-compatible species. We also find that wild plant species suffer more than cultivated ones. Furthermore, the loss of invertebrate, nocturnal and wild pollinators has a more substantial impact than the loss of vertebrate, diurnal or managed pollinators. Overall, our findings consistently underscore the positive role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning, highlighting the urgency of mitigating factors that lead to the decline in pollinator species diversity. A meta-analysis finds that decreasing diversity of pollinator species has a negative affect on multiple measures of plant reproductive success, with wild plant species affected more than cultivated species, and loss of invertebrate, nocturnal and wild pollinators being particularly problematic.},

  abstract     = {Anthropogenic landscape modification may lead to the proliferation of a few species and the loss of many. Here we investigate mechanisms and functional consequences of this winner–loser replacement in six human-modified Amazonian and Atlantic Forest regions in Brazil using a causal inference framework. Combining floristic and functional trait data for 1,207 tree species across 271 forest plots, we find that forest loss consistently caused an increased dominance of low-density woods and small seeds dispersed by endozoochory (winner traits) and the loss of distinctive traits, such as extremely dense woods and large seeds dispersed by synzoochory (loser traits). Effects on leaf traits and maximum tree height were rare or inconsistent. The independent causal effects of landscape configuration were rare, but local degradation remained important in multivariate trait-disturbance relationships and exceeded the effects of forest loss in one Amazonian region. Our findings highlight that tropical forest loss and local degradation drive predictable functional changes to remaining tree assemblages and that certain traits are consistently associated with winners and losers across different regional contexts. Tropical forest landscapes are increasingly being modified by human activities. Here the authors apply a causal inference approach to Neotropical forest data to disentangle the role of landscape-level and local drivers and reveal replacement of ‘loser’ by ‘winner’ tree species with distinct functional profiles.},

Even with other climatic factors controlled (for example, moisture index, temperature and vapour pressure deficit), wind speed clearly affected plant hydraulics; for example, on average, species from windier sites constructed sapwood with smaller D and lower KS that was more resilient to drought (more negative P50), deploying less leaf total area for a given sapwood cross-section. Species with these traits may be at an advantage under future climates with higher wind speeds. A global analysis of hydraulic traits in 1,922 woody plant species shows that wind speed has substantial effects on key traits related to plant water transport, independently of other climatic factors.},

Phenological changes may be unequal within and among trophic levels, potentially impacting the intricate interactions that regulate ecosystem functioning. Here we compile and analyse a global dataset of terrestrial phenological observations, including nearly half a million time series for both plants and animals. Our analysis reveals an increasing phenological asynchronization between plants and animals from 1981 to 2020, with a stronger overall advancement of late-season phenophases for plants than for animals. Almost 30% of temporal variations in plant phenophases can be explained by the timing of the preceding phenophases. This temporal dependency allows the advancement caused by warming to accumulate and propagate through seasons, advancing later phenophases more than earlier phases. By contrast, animals rely on various environmental cues and resource-tracking strategies to initiate their life-cycle activities, which weakens their cross-phenophase linkage and undermines the effect of warming. Our results suggest that future warming may increase phenological asynchronization between plants and animals and potentially disturb trophic interactions and ecosystem stability. Climate change is inducing widespread shifts in the phenology of terrestrial organisms. This global analysis reveals a growing asymmetry between plant and animal responses, with more pronounced phenological shifts in plants.},

  abstract     = {Testing the extent to which ecological communities are structured by deterministic (niche-based) assembly processes, resulting in predictable species abundance and composition, is a fundamental goal of ecology. Here we use a 10-year dataset of 55,156 lianas comprising 86 species in an old-growth tropical forest in Panama to test whether community assembly is consistent with niche-based assembly processes. We find that species diversity and community composition was maintained because species conformed to four general requirements of coexistence theory: (1) species have negative conspecific frequency-dependent feedback that control their local population size; (2) species have a stronger negative effect on their own population than that of heterospecifics; (3) the equilibrium frequencies of species correspond to their relative abundance; and (4) species have positive invasibility. These results indicate that coexistence through deterministic niche-based processes controls local population sizes and prevents any one species from displacing others. Rare species persisted because particularly strong negative feedbacks maintained them at their relatively low equilibrium abundances, thus preventing them from going extinct. Furthermore, we show that it is necessary to use population demography to test coexistence theory because stem mortality alone does not reflect species demography. These findings have broad implications for species coexistence and diversity maintenance in tropical forests and possibly other ecosystems. Ecological communities may arise through distinct assembly processes, which are difficult to disentangle. Here the authors show that deterministic niche-based, not neutral dispersal, assembly processes explain the vast majority of the structure of a tropical forest liana community.},

  abstract     = {Plant communities are composed of species that differ both in functional traits and evolutionary histories. As species’ functional traits partly result from their individual evolutionary history, we expect the functional diversity of communities to increase with increasing phylogenetic diversity. This expectation has only been tested at local scales and generally for specific growth forms or specific habitat types, for example, grasslands. Here we compare standardized effect sizes for functional and phylogenetic diversity among 1,781,836 vegetation plots using the global sPlot database. In contrast to expectations, we find functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity to be only weakly and negatively correlated, implying a decoupling between these two facets of diversity. While phylogenetic diversity is higher in forests and reflects recent climatic conditions (1981 to 2010), functional diversity tends to reflect recent and past climatic conditions (21,000 years ago). The independent nature of functional and phylogenetic diversity makes it crucial to consider both aspects of diversity when analysing ecosystem functioning and prioritizing conservation efforts. Functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity are expected to be positively correlated. Here the authors show that the covariation between these metrics in vascular plant communities around the world is often either inconsistent or negative.},

  abstract     = {Genomic and ancient DNA data have revolutionized palaeoanthropology and our vision of human evolution, with indisputable landmarks like the sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. Yet, using genetic data to identify, date and quantify evolutionary events—such as ancient bottlenecks or admixture—is not straightforward, as inferences may depend on model assumptions. In the last two decades, the idea that Neanderthals and members of the Homo sapiens lineage interbred has gained momentum. From the status of unlikely theory, it has reached consensus among human evolutionary biologists. This theory is mainly supported by statistical approaches that depend on demographic models minimizing or ignoring population structure, despite its widespread occurrence and the fact that, when ignored, population structure can lead to the inference of spurious demographic events. We simulated genomic data under a structured and admixture-free model of human evolution, and found that all the tested admixture approaches identified long Neanderthal fragments in our simulated genomes and an admixture event that never took place. We also observed that several published admixture models failed to predict important empirical diversity or admixture statistics, and that we could identify several scenarios from our structured model that better predicted these statistics jointly. Using a simulated time series of ancient DNA, the structured scenarios could also predict the trajectory of the empirical D statistics. Our results suggest that models accounting for population structure are fundamental to improve our understanding of human evolution, and that admixture between Neanderthals and H. sapiens needs to be re-evaluated in the light of structured models. Beyond the Neanderthal case, we argue that ancient hybridization events, which are increasingly documented in many species, including with other hominins, may also benefit from such re-evaluation. Simulating a metapopulation of human evolution without Neanderthal introgression into Homo sapiens still identifies Neanderthal fragments in simulated genomes, and an admixture event that never took place. This indicates that population structure must be accounted for in human evolutionary genomics and that putative ancient hybridization events should be reinterpreted in this light.},

  abstract     = {Ex situ living plant collections play a crucial role in providing nature-based solutions to twenty-first century global challenges. However, the complex dynamics of these artificial ecosystems are poorly quantified and understood, affecting biodiversity storage, conservation and utilization. To evaluate the management of ex situ plant diversity, we analysed a century of data comprising 2.2 million records, from a meta-collection currently holding ~500,000 accessions and 41% of global ex situ species diversity. Our study provides critical insights into the historical evolution, current state and future trajectory of global living collections. We reveal sigmoidal growth of a meta-collection that has reached capacity in both total accessions and total diversity, and identify intrinsic constraints on biodiversity management, including a median survival probability of 15 years. We explore the impact of external constraints and quantify the influence of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which we link to reduced acquisition of wild-origin and internationally sourced material by 44% and 38%, respectively. We further define the impact of these constraints on ex situ conservation but highlight targeted initiatives that successfully mitigate these challenges. Ultimately, our study underscores the urgent need for strategic prioritization and the re-evaluation of ex situ biodiversity management to achieve both scientific and conservation goals. The authors collate a meta-collection of ex situ living plant diversity held in 50 botanical collections worldwide, spanning a century of data and currently containing ~500,000 accessions. Their analyses examine the capacities and constraints within living plant collections, reveal the impact of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its consequences for material exchange and conservation, and call for the re-evaluation of strategic priorities.},

  abstract     = {Rapid growth in bio-logging—the use of animal-borne electronic tags to document the movements, behaviour, physiology and environments of wildlife—offers opportunities to mitigate biodiversity threats and expand digital natural history archives. Here we present a vision to achieve such benefits by accounting for the heterogeneity inherent to bio-logging data and the concerns of those who collect and use them. First, we can enable data integration through standard vocabularies, transfer protocols and aggregation protocols, and drive their wide adoption. Second, we need to develop integrated data collections on standardized data platforms that support data preservation through public archiving and strategies that ensure long-term access. We outline pathways to reach these goals, highlighting the need for resources to govern community data standards and guide data mobilization efforts. We propose the launch of a community-led coordinating body and provide recommendations for how stakeholders—including government data centres, museums and those who fund, permit and publish bio-logging work—can support these efforts. Animal-borne electronic tags, or bio-loggers, are increasingly used for research and wildlife conservation. This Perspective discusses the importance of standardization, long-term archiving and sharing of bio-logging data, and outlines a roadmap to achieve these goals.},

  abstract     = {The use of herbaria for science and conservation is enabling greatly enhanced scopes and scales of discovery, exploration and protection of biodiversity. The availability of digital, open-access herbarium data is, perhaps counter-intuitively, expanding the use of physical collections by researchers who use digital collections to find specimens and then sample physical collections for multiomics investigations, including genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and microbiomics. These investigations are leading to new scientific insights and supporting the development of conservation actions, but they come with a substantial cost: the partial or complete destruction of often irreplaceable specimens, which constitute a global heritage that should be permanently safeguarded for future reference. Here we provide a set of recommended best practices for the sustainable, equitable and ethical sampling of herbarium specimens. Our recommendations are intended for two complementary and partially overlapping audiences—users and stewards—who together build, use and protect herbarium collections. Greater availability of digital herbarium data is leading to more researchers seeking to sample physical herbarium collections. This Perspective provides recommendations for stewards and users of herbarium collections to ensure optimal preservation of herbarium specimens.},
