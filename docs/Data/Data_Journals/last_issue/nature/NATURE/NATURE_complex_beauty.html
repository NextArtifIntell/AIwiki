  abstract     = {The γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues enables Ca2+-mediated membrane assembly of protein complexes that support broad physiological functions, including haemostasis, calcium homeostasis, immune response and endocrine regulation1–4. Modulating γ-carboxylation levels provides prevalent treatments for haemorrhagic and thromboembolic diseases5. This unique post-translational modification requires vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) to drive highly demanding reactions6 catalysed by the membrane-integrated γ-carboxylase (VKGC). Here, to decipher the underlying mechanisms, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VKGC in unbound form, with KH2 and four haemostatic and non-haemostatic proteins possessing propeptides and glutamate-rich domains in different carboxylation states. VKGC recognizes substrate proteins through knob-and-hole interactions with propeptides, thereby bringing tethered glutamate-containing segments for processive carboxylation within a large chamber that provides steric control. Propeptide binding also triggers a global conformational change to signal VKGC activation. Through sequential deprotonation and KH2 epoxidation, VKGC generates a free hydroxide ion as an exceptionally strong base that is required to deprotonate the γ-carbon of glutamate for CO2 addition. The diffusion of this superbase—protected and guided by a sealed hydrophobic tunnel—elegantly resolves the challenge of coupling KH2 epoxidation to γ-carboxylation across the membrane interface. These structural insights and extensive functional experiments advance membrane enzymology and propel the development of treatments for γ-carboxylation disorders. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal the mechanisms underlying multiple-substrate specificity, coupling of epoxidation with carboxylation and allosteric motions during VKGC catalysis, offering potential strategies for targeting haemostatic and non-haemostatic disorders associated with defects in γ-carboxylation.},

  abstract     = {γ-Glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) is the sole identified enzyme that uses vitamin K (VK) as a cofactor in humans. This protein catalyses the oxidation of VK hydroquinone to convert specific glutamate residues to γ-carboxyglutamate residues in VK-dependent proteins (VDPs), which are involved in various essential biological processes and diseases1–3. However, the working mechanism of GGCX remains unclear. Here we report three cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human GGCX: in the apo state, bound to osteocalcin (a VDP) and bound to VK. The propeptide of the VDP binds to the lumenal domain of GGCX, which stabilizes transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of GGCX to create the VK-binding pocket. After binding of VK, residue Lys218 in GGCX mediates the oxidation of VK hydroxyquinone, which leads to the deprotonation of glutamate residues and the construction of γ-carboxyglutamate residues. Our structural observations and results from binding and cell&amp;nbsp;biological assays and molecular dynamics simulations show that a cholesterol molecule interacts with the transmembrane helices of GGCX to regulate its protein levels in cells. Together, these results establish a link between cholesterol metabolism and VK-dependent pathways.

Although the function of Spo11 has been known for 27 years, previous efforts to reconstitute DSB formation in vitro have been unsuccessful. Here we biochemically characterize the mouse SPO11–TOP6BL protein complex, and show that this complex cleaves DNA and covalently attaches to the 5′ terminus of DNA breaks in vitro. Using a point-mutation strategy, we reveal that Mg2+ is essential for the DNA-cleavage activity of this complex in vitro, as confirmed by knock-in mice carrying a point mutation in SPO11 that disrupts its binding to Mg2+, thereby abolishing DSB formation. However, the activity of the SPO11 complex is ATP-independent. We also present evidence that the mouse SPO11 complex is biochemically distinct from the ancestral topoisomerase VI. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework for understanding the first steps of meiotic recombination. The in vitro characterization of a key event in the early stages of meiosis—the induction of double-strand DNA breaks by the SPO11–TOP6BL complex—provides insight into the catalytic mechanism and evolution of SPO11.},

  abstract     = {SPO11 initiates meiotic recombination through the induction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1,2, but this catalytic activity has never been reconstituted in vitro3,4. Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyses break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5′ broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization for the reconstitution of two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyses DNA cleavage with an activity similar to that of SPO11 alone. However, this complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role after cleavage. We propose a model in which additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11–TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs. A biochemical system recapitulates the hallmarks of meiotic double-strand break formation, with mouse&amp;nbsp;SPO11 catalysing break formation in the absence of any partners and remaining covalently attached to 5′ broken strands.},

  abstract     = {Meiotic recombination starts with SPO11 generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1. SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species, but it generates dangerous DSBs with mutagenic2 and gametocidal3 potential. Cells must therefore utilize the beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks4—how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to TOP6BL. SPO11–TOP6BL complexes are monomeric (1:1) in solution and bind tightly to DNA, but dimeric (2:2) assemblies cleave DNA to form covalent 5′ attachments that require SPO11 active-site residues, divalent metal ions and SPO11 dimerization. SPO11 can also reseal DNA that it has nicked. Structure modelling with AlphaFold 3 suggests that DNA is bent prior to cleavage5. In vitro cleavage displays a sequence bias that partially explains DSB site preferences in vivo. Cleavage is inefficient on complex DNA substrates, partly because SPO11 is readily trapped in DSB-incompetent (presumably monomeric) binding states that exchange slowly. However, cleavage is improved with substrates that favour dimer assembly or by artificially dimerizing SPO11. Our results inform a model in which intrinsically weak dimerization restrains SPO11 activity in vivo, making it exquisitely dependent on accessory proteins that focus and control DSB formation. Reconstitution of recombinantly expressed SPO11–TOP6BL complex recapitulates its DNA cleavage function and together with structural modelling and biochemical experiments, provides insights into the regulation and mechanism of SPO11 activity.},

Here, using 18 single, double and triple whole-body and tissue-specific knockout and mutant mice, along with systematic mitochondrial morphology analysis, untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered that the synergy between two stress-responsive systems—the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin and the metalloprotease OMA1—safeguards mitochondrial structure and genome by mitochondrial fusion, mediated by the outer membrane GTPase MFN1 and the inner membrane GTPase OPA1. Whereas the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses. Thus, our data show that Parkin and OMA1 maintain a dual regulatory mechanism that controls mitochondrial fusion at the two membranes, even in the absence of extrinsic stress. We find that, in mice, although the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses.},

  abstract     = {Elevated or ectopic expression of neuronal receptors promotes tumour progression in many cancer types1,2; neuroendocrine (NE) transformation of adenocarcinomas has also been associated with increased aggressiveness3. Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells4,5. Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte–neuron metabolite shuttle6. Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential. Electrical excitability in neuroendocrine SCLC cells promotes tumour progression through action potential firing, increasing ATP demand and oxidative phosphorylation dependency, whereas non-neuroendocrine cells provide metabolic support, driving a tumour-autonomous cycle that enhances tumorigenesis and metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide1,2. HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that&amp;nbsp;accumulate progressive driver mutations3, with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin2. However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is broadly independent of the underlying aetiologies4. Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC, outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations5,6. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC7. Here we generated a suite of genetically driven immunocompetent in vivo and matched in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance and metastasis. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human–mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with the human histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard-of-care treatment&amp;nbsp;and used a linked in vitro–in vivo pipeline&amp;nbsp;to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not previously been linked to HCC treatment. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy. As proof of principle, an analysis using a suite of human-aligned&amp;nbsp;immunocompetent mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma identifies a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, which acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy.},

  abstract     = {Although cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for anti-tumour immunity, they are frequently dysfunctional in tumours1. Cytokines that sustain CTL activity are attractive for cancer immunotherapy, but avoiding inflammatory toxicity remains a challenge for their clinical use2. Here we show that expression of a CTL signature is strongly associated with IL27 expression in human and mouse tumours. In mice, IL-27 acts directly on tumour-specific CTLs to promote their persistence and effector function in the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, treatment with inducible IL-27 overexpression or a half-life-extended IL-27 protein in vivo is well tolerated, induces regression of established tumours, drives an enhanced cytotoxic program in anti-tumour CTLs and synergizes with PD-L1 blockade. In patients with cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, high expression of IL-27 correlates with a favourable clinical response, and IL-27 supports human CTL function during chronic antigen stimulation ex vivo. Our data demonstrate that endogenous IL-27 is essential for anti-tumour immunity and that IL-27 receptor agonism can safely improve anti-tumour T cell responses alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade.

  abstract     = {The development of animal models is crucial for studying and treating mitochondrial diseases. Here we optimized adenine and cytosine deaminases to reduce off-target effects on the transcriptome and the mitochondrial genome, improving the accuracy and efficiency of our newly developed mitochondrial base editors (mitoBEs)1. Using these upgraded mitoBEs (version 2 (v2)), we targeted 70 mouse mitochondrial DNA mutations analogous to human pathogenic variants2, establishing a foundation for mitochondrial disease mouse models. Circular RNA-encoded mitoBEs v2 achieved up to 82% editing efficiency in mice without detectable off-target effects in the nuclear genome. The edited mitochondrial DNA persisted across various tissues and was maternally inherited, resulting in F1 generation mice with mutation loads as high as 100% and some mice exhibiting editing only at the target site. By optimizing the transcription activator-like effector (TALE)&amp;nbsp;binding site, we developed a single-base-editing mouse model for the mt-Nd5 A12784G mutation. Phenotypic evaluations led to the creation of mouse models for the mt-Atp6 T8591C and mt-Nd5 A12784G mutations, exhibiting phenotypes corresponding to the reduced heart rate seen in Leigh syndrome and the vision loss characteristic of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, respectively. Moreover, the mt-Atp6 T8591C mutation proved to be more deleterious than mt-Nd5 A12784G, affecting embryonic development and rapidly diminishing through successive generations. These upgraded mitoBEs offer a highly efficient and precise strategy for constructing mitochondrial disease models, laying a foundation for further research in this field. A study reports optimized mitochondrial base editors with reduced off-target effects to facilitate the generation of mouse models of human mitochondrial diseases.},

  abstract     = {Caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) and pyrin domains are important facilitators of inflammasome activity and pyroptosis1. Following pathogen recognition by nucleotide binding-domain, leucine-rich, repeat-containing (NLR)&amp;nbsp;proteins, CARDs recruit and activate caspases, which, in turn, activate gasdermin pore-forming proteins to induce pyroptotic cell death2. Here we show that CARD domains are present in defence systems that protect bacteria against phage. The bacterial CARD domain is essential for protease-mediated activation of certain bacterial gasdermins, which promote cell death once phage infection is recognized. We further show that multiple anti-phage defence systems use CARD domains to activate a variety of cell death effectors, and that CARD domains mediate protein–protein interactions in these systems. We find that these systems are triggered by a conserved immune-evasion protein used by phages to overcome the bacterial defence system RexAB3, demonstrating that phage proteins inhibiting one defence system can activate another. Our results suggest that CARD domains represent an ancient component of innate immune systems conserved from bacteria to humans, and that CARD-dependent activation of gasdermins is shared in organisms across the tree of life.

  abstract     = {Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning&amp;nbsp;(RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions3. Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons4–9 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL. D1- and D2-expressing striatal neurons encode separate parts of a learned reward distribution, paralleling modern approaches in machine learning.},

  abstract     = {The hypothalamus is a brain region that plays a key role in coordinating fundamental biological functions1. However, our understanding of the underlying cellular components and neurocircuitries have, until recently, emerged primarily from rodent studies2,3. Here we combine single-nucleus sequencing of 433,369 human hypothalamic cells with spatial transcriptomics, generating a comprehensive spatio-cellular transcriptional map of the hypothalamus, the ‘HYPOMAP’. Although conservation of neuronal cell types between humans and mice, as&amp;nbsp;based on transcriptomic identity, is generally high, there are notable exceptions. Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find that&amp;nbsp;291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 ‘effector’ genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these (MC4R, PCSK1, POMC, CALCR, BSN and CORO1A) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI. Thus, HYPOMAP provides a detailed atlas of the human hypothalamus in a spatial context and serves as an important resource to identify new druggable targets for treating a wide range of conditions, including reproductive, circadian and metabolic disorders. HYPOMAP integrates single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data to create a comprehensive spatio-cellular map of the human hypothalamus.},

  abstract     = {Human recombination maps are a valuable resource for association and linkage studies and crucial for many inferences of population history and natural selection. Existing maps1–5 are based solely on cross-over (CO) recombination, omitting non-cross-overs (NCOs)—the more common form of recombination6—owing to the difficulty in detecting them. Using whole-genome sequence data in families, we estimate the number of NCOs transmitted from parent to offspring and derive complete, sex-specific recombination maps including both NCOs and COs. Mothers have fewer but longer NCOs than fathers, and oocytes accumulate NCOs in a non-regulated fashion with maternal age. Recombination, primarily NCO, is responsible for 1.8% (95% confidence interval: 1.3–2.3) and 11.3% (95% confidence interval: 9.0–13.6) of paternal and maternal de novo mutations, respectively, and may drive the increase in de novo mutations with maternal age. NCOs are substantially more prominent than COs in centromeres, possibly to avoid large-scale genomic changes that may cause aneuploidy. Our results demonstrate that NCOs highlight to a much greater extent than COs the differences in the meiotic process between the sexes, in which maternal NCOs may reflect the safeguarding of oocytes from infancy until ovulation. Complete human recombination maps are presented that enable exploration of both cross-over and non-cross-over events during meiosis, with the potential to provide insight into the causes of aneuploidies and pregnancy loss.},

  abstract     = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is widespread across eukaryotes and can promote adaptive evolution1–4. However, given the instability of newly formed polyploid genomes5–7, understanding how WGDs arise in a population, persist, and underpin adaptations remains a challenge. Here, using our ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE)8, we show that diploid snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under selection for larger multicellular size rapidly evolve to be tetraploid. From their origin within the first 50 days of the experiment, tetraploids persisted for the next 950 days (nearly 5,000 generations, the current leading edge of our experiment) in 10 replicate populations, despite being genomically unstable. Using synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modelling and counter-selection, we found that tetraploidy evolved because it confers immediate fitness benefits under this selection, by producing larger, longer cells that yield larger clusters. The same selective benefit also maintained tetraploidy over long evolutionary timescales, inhibiting the reversion to diploidy that is typically seen in laboratory evolution experiments. Once established, tetraploidy facilitated novel genetic routes for adaptation, having a key role in the evolution of macroscopic multicellular size via the origin of evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy. These results provide unique empirical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and impacts of WGD, showing how it can initially arise due to its immediate adaptive benefits, be maintained by selection and fuel long-term innovations by creating additional dimensions of heritable genetic variation. In the Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment, diploid yeast evolve to be tetraploid under selection for larger multicellular size, revealing how whole-genome duplication can arise due to its immediate benefits, persist under selection, and fuel long-term innovations via aneuploidy.},

  abstract     = {How new structures emerge during evolution has long fascinated biologists. An example is how the diminutive bones of the mammalian middle ear arose from ancestral fish jawbones1. By contrast, the evolutionary origin of the outer ear, another mammalian innovation, remains a mystery, partly because it is supported by non-mineralized elastic cartilage, which is rarely recovered in fossils. Whether the outer ear arose de novo or through the reuse of ancestral developmental programs has remained unknown. Here we show that the outer ear shares gene regulatory programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians for both its initial outgrowth and the later development of the elastic cartilage. Comparative single-nucleus multiomics of the human outer ear and zebrafish gills reveals conserved gene expression and putative enhancers enriched for common transcription factor binding motifs. This is reflected by the transgenic activity of human outer-ear enhancers in gills, and of fish gill enhancers in the outer ear. Furthermore, single-cell multiomics of the cartilaginous book gills of horseshoe crabs reveals a&amp;nbsp;developmental program shared with the distal-less homeobox (DLX)-mediated gill program of vertebrates, with a book-gill distal-less enhancer driving expression in zebrafish gills. We propose that elements of an invertebrate gill program were reutilized in vertebrates to generate first gills and then the outer ear. A study on the evolutionary origin of the mammalian outer ear finds that it shares genetic programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians, indicating that elements of an ancestral gill have been reused.},

Here we surveyed children in Kolkata and Delhi, India, who work in markets (n = 1,436), to investigate whether maths skills acquired in real-world settings transfer to the classroom and vice versa. Nearly all these children used complex arithmetic calculations effectively at work. They were also proficient in solving hypothetical market maths problems and verbal maths problems that were anchored to concrete contexts. However, they were unable to solve arithmetic problems of equal or lesser complexity when presented in the abstract format typically used in school. The children’s performance in market maths problems was not explained by memorization, access to help, reduced stress with more familiar formats or high incentives for correct performance. By contrast, children with no market-selling experience (n = 471), enrolled in nearby schools, showed the opposite pattern. These children performed more accurately on simple abstract problems, but only 1% could correctly answer an applied market maths problem that more than one third of working children solved (β = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = 0.30–0.40, P &amp;lt; 0.001). School children used highly inefficient written calculations, could not combine different operations and arrived at answers too slowly to be useful in real-life or in higher maths. These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal maths. Children who learn maths&amp;nbsp;working in markets and children who learn maths only from school were both unable to transfer their skills to new contexts, highlighting a need to reconsider how maths is taught in school.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding1. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns2, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe3. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy&amp;nbsp;rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers. Long-term increases in heavy daily and hourly precipitation in Austria from different climatic mechanisms emphasize the need for flood management adaptation, especially in smaller catchments affected by the increased hourly rainfall.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art climate models project a substantial decline in precipitation for the Mediterranean region in the future1. Supporting this notion, several studies based on observed precipitation data spanning recent decades have suggested a decrease in Mediterranean precipitation2–4, with some attributing a large fraction of this change to anthropogenic influences3,5. Conversely, certain researchers have underlined that Mediterranean precipitation exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variability driven by atmospheric circulation patterns6,7 maintaining stationarity over the long term8,9. These conflicting perspectives underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes in this region, given the profound social, economic and environmental implications. Here we show that Mediterranean precipitation has largely remained stationary&amp;nbsp;from 1871 to 2020, albeit with significant multi-decadal and interannual variability. This conclusion is based on the most comprehensive dataset available for the region, encompassing over 23,000 stations across 27 countries. While trends can be identified for some periods and subregions, our findings attribute these trends primarily to atmospheric dynamics, which would be mostly linked to internal variability. Furthermore, our assessment reconciles the observed precipitation trends with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations, neither of which indicate a prevailing past precipitation trend in the region. The implications of our results extend to environmental, agricultural and water resources planning in one of the world’s prominent climate change hotspots10.

  abstract     = {Rates of relative sea-level rise during the final stage of the last deglaciation, the early Holocene, are key to understanding future ice melt and sea-level change under a warming climate1. Data about these rates are scarce2, and this limits insight into the relative contributions of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets to global sea-level rise during the early Holocene. Here we present an early Holocene sea-level curve based on 88 sea-level data points (13.7–6.2 thousand years ago (ka)) from the North Sea (Doggerland3,4). After removing the pattern of regional glacial isostatic adjustment caused by the melting of the Eurasian Ice Sheet, the residual sea-level signal highlights two phases of accelerated sea-level rise. Meltwater sourced from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets drove these two phases, peaking around 10.3 ka and 8.3 ka with rates between 8 mm yr−1 and 9 mm yr−1. Our results also show that global mean sea-level rise between 11 ka and 3 ka amounted to 37.7 m (2σ range, 29.3–42.2 m), reconciling the mismatch that existed between estimates of global mean sea-level rise based on ice-sheet reconstructions and previously limited early Holocene sea-level data. With its broad spatiotemporal coverage, the North Sea dataset provides critical constraints on the patterns and rates of the late-stage deglaciation of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets, improving our understanding of the Earth-system response to climate change. An early Holocene sea-level curve based on data from the North Sea reveals two phases of accelerated sea-level rise owing to meltwater from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets.},

  abstract     = {The Antarctic ozone ‘hole’ was discovered in 1985 (ref. 1) and man-made ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are its primary cause2. Following reductions of ODSs under the Montreal Protocol3, signs of ozone recovery have been reported, based largely on observations and broad yet compelling model–data comparisons4. Although such approaches are highly valuable, they do not provide rigorous statistical detection of the temporal and spatial structure of Antarctic ozone recovery in the presence of internal climate variability. Here we apply pattern-based detection and attribution methods as used in climate-change studies5–11 to separate anthropogenically forced ozone responses from internal variability, relying on trend pattern information as a function of month and height. The analysis uses satellite observations together with single-model and multi-model ensemble simulations to identify and quantify the month–height Antarctic ozone recovery ‘fingerprint’12. We demonstrate that the data and simulations show compelling agreement in the fingerprint pattern of the ozone response to decreasing ODSs since 2005. We also show that ODS forcing has enhanced ozone internal variability during the austral spring, influencing detection of forced responses and their time of emergence. Our results provide robust statistical and physical evidence that actions taken under the Montreal Protocol to reduce ODSs are indeed resulting in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery, defined as increases in ozone consistent with expected month–height patterns. Pattern-based detection and attribution methods that make use of trend pattern information as a function of month and height provide evidence that reduction of ozone-depleting substances has resulted in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery.},

These qualities make them ideal for lightweight, miniaturized and multi-functional structures3–8. However, achieving high enthalpy is&amp;nbsp;challenging, as it requires combining conflicting properties: high stiffness, high strength and large recoverable strain9–11. Here, to address this challenge, we construct high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials from freely rotatable chiral metacells. Compared with existing non-chiral lattices, the non-optimized chiral metamaterials simultaneously maintain high stiffness, sustain larger recoverable strain, offer a wider buckling plateau, improve the buckling strength by 5–10 times, enhance enthalpy by 2–160 times and increase energy per mass by 2–32 times. These improvements arise from torsional buckling deformation that is triggered by chirality and is absent in conventional metamaterials. This deformation mode stores considerable additional energy while having a minimal impact on peak stresses that define material failure. Our findings identify a mechanism and provide insight into the design of metamaterials and structures with high mechanical energy storage capacity, a fundamental and general problem of broad engineering interest. High-enthalpy elastic metamaterials constructed from freely rotatable chiral metacells have high stiffness, large recoverable strain and improved buckling strength.},

  abstract     = {The electroluminescence performance of heavy-metal-free blue quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) is much lower than that of state-of-the-art cadmium-based counterparts. Ecofriendly ZnSeTe QDs are an ideal alternative to cadmium-based blue QDs1,2, but face issues with colour impurity and inferior stability caused by the aggregated tellurium (Ten≥2) that dominates compositional inhomogeneity3,4. Here we developed an isoelectronic control strategy using congeneric sulfur coordinated with triphenyl phosphite (TPP-S) to construct homogeneous ZnSeTeS QDs with pure-blue emissions and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. TPP with low electron-donating capability promotes the reactivity balance among anionic precursors, favouring the growth of QDs with uniform composition. The acceptor-like S with high electronegativity weakens the hole localization of the Te atoms by interfering with their surrounding carriers, thereby suppressing the formation of Ten≥2 isoelectronic centres. Furthermore, the congeneric S increases the configurational entropy of the QDs and eliminates the stacking faults and oxygen defects, leading to improved structural stability and reduced non-radiative carrier density. Consequently, the resulting pure-blue QLEDs based on core–shell ZnSeTeS/ZnSe/ZnS QDs emitting at 460 nm show a high external quantum efficiency of 24.7%, a narrow linewidth of 17 nm, and long operational half-lifetime (T50) close to 30,000 hours at 100 cd cm−2, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue QLEDs. By suppressing compositional heterogeneities in cadmium-free quantum dots, environmentally friendly pure-blue-light-emitting diodes with enhanced efficiencies, lifetimes and spectral purity are achieved, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue quantum-dot light-emitting diodes.},

Generative models accelerate&amp;nbsp;materials design by directly generating new materials given desired property constraints, but current methods have a low success rate in proposing stable crystals or can satisfy only&amp;nbsp;a limited set of property constraints4–11. Here we present MatterGen, a model that generates stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property constraints. Compared with previous generative models4,12, structures produced by MatterGen are more than twice as likely to be new and stable, and more than ten times closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully generates stable, new materials with desired chemistry, symmetry and mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. As a proof of concept, we synthesize one of the generated structures and measure its property value to be within 20% of our target. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of abilities of MatterGen represent an important advancement towards creating a foundational generative model for materials design.

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) edge devices1–12 demand high-precision energy-efficient computations, large on-chip model storage, rapid wakeup-to-response time and cost-effective foundry-ready solutions. Floating&amp;nbsp;point (FP) computation provides precision exceeding that of integer (INT) formats at the cost of higher power and storage overhead. Multi-level-cell (MLC) memristor compute-in-memory (CIM)13–15 provides compact non-volatile storage and energy-efficient computation but is prone to accuracy loss owing to process variation. Digital static random-access memory (SRAM)-CIM16–22 enables lossless computation; however, storage is low as a result of large bit-cell area and model loading is required during inference. Thus, conventional approaches using homogeneous CIM architectures and computation formats impose a trade-off between efficiency, storage, wakeup latency and inference accuracy. Here we present a mixed-precision heterogeneous CIM AI edge processor, which supports the layer-granular/kernel-granular partitioning of network layers among on-chip CIM architectures (that is, memristor-CIM, SRAM-CIM and tiny-digital units) and computation number formats (INT and FP) based on sensitivity to error. This layer-granular/kernel-granular flexibility allows simultaneous optimization within the two-dimensional design space at the hardware level. The proposed hardware achieved high energy efficiency (40.91 TFLOPS W−1 for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and 28.63 TFLOPS W−1 for MobileNet-v2 with ImageNet), low accuracy degradation (&amp;lt;0.45% for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and for MobilNet-v2 with ImageNet) and rapid&amp;nbsp;wakeup-to-response time (373.52 μs).

So far, these systems are primarily handcrafted by domain experts and tweaked through heuristics rather than being automatically optimized, presenting a substantial challenge to accelerating progress. The development of artificial neural networks faced a similar challenge until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turnkey. Analogously, here we introduce TextGrad, a versatile framework that performs optimization by backpropagating LLM-generated feedback to improve AI systems. By leveraging natural language feedback to critique and suggest improvements to any part of a system—from prompts to outputs such as molecules or treatment plans—TextGrad enables the automatic optimization of generative AI systems across diverse tasks. We demonstrate TextGrad’s generality and effectiveness through studies in solving PhD-level science problems, optimizing plans for radiotherapy treatments, designing molecules with specific properties, coding, and optimizing agentic systems. TextGrad empowers scientists and engineers to easily develop impactful generative AI systems.

Intuitively, disorder is considered detrimental, requiring efforts to mitigate its effects in conventional topological photonics6–9. We propose a counter-intuitive approach that exploits a real–momentum topological photonic crystal that harnesses real-space disorder to generate a Pancharatnam–Berry phase10,11, without disrupting the momentum-space singularity originating from bound states in the continuum12. This methodology allows flat optical devices to encode spatial information or even extra topological charge in real space while preserving the topology of bound states in the continuum in momentum space with inherent alignment. Here, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous and independent generation of a real-space broadband vortex or a holographic image alongside resonant momentum-space vortex beams with a narrow bandwidth, which cannot be achieved with conventional methods. Such engineered disorder contributes to vast intrinsic freedoms without adding extra dimensions or compromising the optical flatness13,14. Our findings of real–momentum duality not only lay the foundation for disorder engineering in topological photonics but also open new avenues for optical wavefront shaping, encryption and communications.

By directly investigating evolutionary dynamics in real time, these approaches have provided unparallelled insights into the complex interplay between evolutionary process and pattern. These approaches can reveal oscillations, stochastic fluctuations and systematic trends that unfold over extended periods, expose critical time lags between environmental shifts and population responses, and illuminate how subtle effects may accumulate into significant evolutionary patterns. Long-term studies can also reveal otherwise cryptic trends that unfold over extended periods, and offer the potential for serendipity: observing rare events that spur new evolutionary hypotheses and research directions. Despite the challenges of conducting long-term research, exacerbated by modern funding landscapes favouring short-term projects, the contributions of long-term studies to evolutionary biology are indispensable. This is particularly true in our rapidly changing, human-dominated world, where such studies offer a crucial window into how environmental changes and altered species interactions shape evolutionary trajectories. In this Review article, we showcase the groundbreaking discoveries of long-term evolutionary studies, underscoring their crucial role in advancing our understanding of the complex nature of evolution across multiple systems and timescales.
