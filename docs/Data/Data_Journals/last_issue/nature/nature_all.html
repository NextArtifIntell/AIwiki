  abstract     = {Soft materials underpin many domains of science and engineering, including soft robotics, structured fluids, and biological and particulate media. In response to applied mechanical, electromagnetic or chemical stimuli, such materials typically change shape, often dramatically. Predicting their structure is of great interest to facilitate design and mechanistic understanding, and can be cast as an optimization problem where a given energy function describing the physics of the material is minimized with respect to the shape of the domain and additional fields. However, shape-optimization problems are very challenging to solve, and there is a lack of suitable simulation tools that are both readily accessible and general in purpose. Here we present an open-source programmable environment, Morpho, and demonstrate its versatility by showcasing a range of applications from different areas of soft-matter physics: swelling hydrogels, complex fluids that form aspherical droplets, soap films and membranes, and filaments. This study introduces an extensible framework—Morpho—for shape optimization, enabling researchers to predict the structure of soft materials, such as complex fluids, gels, particulate and biological materials.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how visual information is encoded in biological and artificial systems often requires the generation of appropriate stimuli to test specific hypotheses, but available methods for video generation are scarce. Here we introduce the spatiotemporal style transfer (STST) algorithm, a dynamic visual stimulus generation framework that allows the manipulation and synthesis of video stimuli for vision research. We show how stimuli can be generated that match the low-level spatiotemporal features of their natural counterparts, but lack their high-level semantic features, providing a useful tool to study object recognition. We used these stimuli to probe PredNet, a predictive coding deep network, and found that its next-frame predictions were not disrupted by the omission of high-level information, with human observers also confirming the preservation of low-level features and lack of high-level information in the generated stimuli. We also introduce a procedure for the independent spatiotemporal factorization of dynamic stimuli. Testing such factorized stimuli on humans and deep vision models suggests a spatial bias in how humans and deep vision models encode dynamic visual information. These results showcase potential applications of the STST algorithm as a versatile tool for dynamic stimulus generation in vision science. The spatiotemporal style transfer (STST) algorithm enables video generation by selectively manipulating the spatial and temporal features of natural videos, fostering vision science research in both biological and artificial systems.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules; however, most existing machine learning models for molecular electronic properties use density functional theory (DFT) databases as ground truth in training, and their prediction accuracy cannot surpass that of DFT. In this work we developed a unified machine learning method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms DFT with several widely used hybrid and double-hybrid functionals in terms of both computational cost and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. We apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers, evaluating both ground- and excited-state properties. The results demonstrate the model’s accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that cannot be calculated using CCSD(T)-level methods due to scaling. A multi-task deep learning method for molecular electronic structures, called MEHnet, is developed to predict various molecular properties in a unified framework, approaching chemical accuracy while exhibiting local DFT-level computational costs.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies have improved our understanding of the contributions of coding and noncoding rare variants to complex human traits. Leveraging association effect sizes across multiple traits in WGS rare variant association analysis can improve statistical power over single-trait analysis, and also detect pleiotropic genes and regions. Existing multi-trait methods have limited ability to perform rare variant analysis of large-scale WGS data. We propose MultiSTAAR, a statistical framework and computationally scalable analytical pipeline for functionally informed multi-trait rare variant analysis in large-scale WGS studies. MultiSTAAR accounts for relatedness, population structure and correlation among phenotypes by jointly analyzing multiple traits, and further empowers rare variant association analysis by incorporating multiple functional annotations. We applied MultiSTAAR to jointly analyze three lipid traits in 61,838 multi-ethnic samples from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program. We discovered and replicated new associations with lipid traits missed by single-trait analysis. MultiSTAAR provides a general and flexible statistical framework for functionally informed multi-trait rare variant analysis of biobank-scale sequencing studies by jointly analyzing multiple traits and incorporating annotation information.},

  abstract     = {Computational analysis of a large number of genomes requires a data structure that can represent the dataset compactly while also enabling efficient operations on variants and samples. However, encoding genetic data in existing tabular data structures and file formats has become costly and unsustainable. Here we introduce the genotype representation graph (GRG), a fully connected hierarchical data structure that losslessly encodes phased whole-genome polymorphisms. Exploiting variant-sharing across samples enables GRG to compress 200,000 UK Biobank phased human genomes to 5–26 gigabytes per chromosome, also enabling graph-traversal algorithms to reuse computed values in random access memory. Constructing and processing GRG files scales to a million whole genomes. Using allele frequencies and association effects as examples, we show that computation on GRG via graph traversal runs the fastest among all tested alternatives. GRG-based algorithms have the potential to increase the scalability and reduce the cost of analyzing large genomic datasets. The genotype representation graph (GRG) is a compact data structure that encodes 200,000 human genomes in just 5–26 gigabytes per chromosome. Computation on GRG via graph traversal greatly accelerates genome-wide analysis.},

  abstract     = {Crystallization of amorphous precursors into metastable crystals plays a fundamental role in the formation of new matter, from geological to biological processes in nature to the synthesis and development of new materials in the laboratory. Reliably predicting the outcome of such a process would enable new research directions in these areas, but has remained beyond the reach of molecular modeling or ab initio methods. Here we show that candidates for the crystallization products of amorphous precursors can be predicted in many inorganic systems by sampling the local structural motifs at the atomistic level using universal deep learning interatomic potentials. We show that this approach identifies, with high accuracy, the most likely crystal structures of the polymorphs that initially nucleate from amorphous precursors, across a diverse set of material systems, including polymorphic oxides, nitrides, carbides, fluorides, chlorides, chalcogenides and metal alloys. This study introduces a2c, a computational method that leverages machine learning and atomistic simulations to predict the most likely crystallization products upon annealing of amorphous precursors. The a2c tool was demonstrated on a variety of materials, including oxides, nitrides and metallic glasses, and can assist researchers in discovering synthesis pathways for materials design.},

  abstract     = {A pressing question resulting from global warming is how climate change will affect infectious diseases. Answering this question requires research into the effects of weather on the population dynamics of transmission and infection; elucidating these effects, however, has proved difficult due to the challenges of assessing causality from the predominantly observational data available in epidemiological research. Here we show how concepts from causal inference—the sub-field of statistics aiming at inferring causality from data—can guide that research. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how such concepts can help assess study design and strategically choose a study’s location, evaluate and reduce the risk of bias, and interpret the multifaceted effects of meteorological variables on transmission. More broadly, we argue that interdisciplinary approaches based on explicit causal frameworks are crucial for reliably estimating the effect of weather and accurately predicting the consequences of climate change. A series of case studies is used to illustrate how concepts from causal interference can be used to guide research into the effects of weather on the transmission and population dynamics of infectious diseases.},

  abstract     = {Our understanding of animal ornaments and the mating preferences driving their exaggeration is limited by knowledge of their genetics. Post-copulatory sexual selection is credited with the rapid evolution of female sperm-storage organ morphology and corresponding sperm quality traits across diverse taxa. In Drosophila, the mechanisms by which longer flagella convey an advantage in the competition among sperm for limited storage space in the female, and by which female sperm-storage organ morphology biases fertilization in favour of longer sperm have been resolved. However, the evolutionary genetics underlying this model post-copulatory ornament and preference system have remained elusive. Here we combined comparative analyses of 149 Drosophila species, a genome-wide association study in Drosophila melanogaster and molecular evolutionary analysis of ~9,400 genes to elucidate how sperm and female sperm-storage organ length co-evolved into one of nature’s most extreme ornaments and preferences. Our results reveal a diverse repertoire of pleiotropic genes linking sperm length and seminal receptacle length expression to central nervous system development and sensory biology. Sperm length development appears condition-dependent and is governed by conserved hormonal (insulin/insulin-like growth factor) and developmental (including Notch and Fruitless) pathways. Central developmental pathway genes, including Notch, also comprised the majority of a restricted set of genes contributing to both intraspecific and interspecific variation in sperm length. Our findings support ‘good genes’ models of female preference evolution. A comparative analysis of morphological data across 149 species of Drosophilidae shows that sperm length in males has co-evolved with the length of the sperm-storage organ in females. Combining a genome-wide association study of these traits in Drosophila melanogaster with molecular evolutionary analyses of the genomes of 15 Drosophila species, the authors find that the genetic architecture underlying sperm length is associated with indirect genetic benefits in females, providing support for the ‘good genes’ hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {The probability of parallel genetic evolution is a function of the strength of selection and constraints imposed by genetic architecture. Inversions capture locally adapted alleles and suppress recombination between them, which limits the range of adaptive responses. In addition, the combined phenotypic effect of alleles within inversions is likely to be greater than that of individual alleles; this should further increase the contributions of inversions to parallel evolution. We tested the hypothesis that inversions contribute disproportionately to parallel genetic evolution in independent dune ecotypes of Helianthus petiolaris. We analysed habitat data and identified variables underlying parallel habitat shifts. Genotype–environment association analyses of these variables indicated parallel responses of inversions to shared selective pressures. We also confirmed larger seed size across the dunes and performed quantitative trait locus mapping with multiple crosses. Quantitative trait loci shared between locations fell into inversions more than expected by chance. We used whole-genome sequencing data to identify selective sweeps in the dune ecotypes and found that the majority of shared swept regions were found within inversions. Phylogenetic analyses of shared regions indicated that within inversions, the same allele typically was found in the dune habitat at both sites. These results confirm predictions that inversions drive parallel divergence in the dune ecotypes. Analysis of habitat data, quantitative trait locus mapping of seed size and selective sweeps show parallel selection acting on inversions in two independent dune ecotypes of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris.},

  abstract     = {Environmental filtering and dispersal history limit plant distributions and affect biogeographical patterns, but how their relative importance varies across evolutionary timescales is unresolved. Phylogenetic beta diversity quantifies dissimilarity in evolutionary relatedness among assemblages and might help resolve the ecological and biogeographical mechanisms structuring biodiversity. Here, we examined the effects of environmental dissimilarity and geographical distance on phylogenetic and taxonomic turnover for ~270,000 seed plant species globally and across evolutionary timescales. We calculated past and present dispersal barriers using palaeogeographical reconstructions and calculated geographical linear and least-cost distances, accounting for dispersal over water, mountains or areas with unsuitable climates. Environmental dissimilarity and geographical distance jointly explained most of the deviance in taxonomic (up to 86.4%) and phylogenetic turnover (65.6%). While environmental dissimilarity consistently showed strongly positive effects, the effect of geographical distance on phylogenetic turnover was less pronounced further back in evolutionary time. Past physiogeographical barriers explained a relatively low amount of the variation across all timescales, with a slight peak at intermediate timescales (20–50 Myr bp). Our results suggest that while old lineages have generally dispersed widely, the imprint of environmental filtering on range expansion persists, providing insights into biogeographical and evolutionary processes underlying global biodiversity patterns. This modelling study integrates comprehensive regional plant inventories, environmental conditions and palaeogeographical reconstructions to assess the relative roles of environmental filtering and dispersal barriers in shaping global seed plant diversity, demonstrating that environmental filtering has a persistent effect on species distribution patterns across evolutionary timescales.},

While previous studies have often examined the extreme scenario of complete pollinator removal, showing negative impacts on plant reproductive success, we take a more realistic approach by focusing on the effects of decreasing pollinator diversity. Our global meta-analysis reveals a notable negative impact of reduced pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success measures, such as seed set, fruit set and fruit weight. Notably, this effect varies across plant families, impacting both self-incompatible and self-compatible species. We also find that wild plant species suffer more than cultivated ones. Furthermore, the loss of invertebrate, nocturnal and wild pollinators has a more substantial impact than the loss of vertebrate, diurnal or managed pollinators. Overall, our findings consistently underscore the positive role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning, highlighting the urgency of mitigating factors that lead to the decline in pollinator species diversity. A meta-analysis finds that decreasing diversity of pollinator species has a negative affect on multiple measures of plant reproductive success, with wild plant species affected more than cultivated species, and loss of invertebrate, nocturnal and wild pollinators being particularly problematic.},

  abstract     = {Anthropogenic landscape modification may lead to the proliferation of a few species and the loss of many. Here we investigate mechanisms and functional consequences of this winner–loser replacement in six human-modified Amazonian and Atlantic Forest regions in Brazil using a causal inference framework. Combining floristic and functional trait data for 1,207 tree species across 271 forest plots, we find that forest loss consistently caused an increased dominance of low-density woods and small seeds dispersed by endozoochory (winner traits) and the loss of distinctive traits, such as extremely dense woods and large seeds dispersed by synzoochory (loser traits). Effects on leaf traits and maximum tree height were rare or inconsistent. The independent causal effects of landscape configuration were rare, but local degradation remained important in multivariate trait-disturbance relationships and exceeded the effects of forest loss in one Amazonian region. Our findings highlight that tropical forest loss and local degradation drive predictable functional changes to remaining tree assemblages and that certain traits are consistently associated with winners and losers across different regional contexts. Tropical forest landscapes are increasingly being modified by human activities. Here the authors apply a causal inference approach to Neotropical forest data to disentangle the role of landscape-level and local drivers and reveal replacement of ‘loser’ by ‘winner’ tree species with distinct functional profiles.},

Even with other climatic factors controlled (for example, moisture index, temperature and vapour pressure deficit), wind speed clearly affected plant hydraulics; for example, on average, species from windier sites constructed sapwood with smaller D and lower KS that was more resilient to drought (more negative P50), deploying less leaf total area for a given sapwood cross-section. Species with these traits may be at an advantage under future climates with higher wind speeds. A global analysis of hydraulic traits in 1,922 woody plant species shows that wind speed has substantial effects on key traits related to plant water transport, independently of other climatic factors.},

Phenological changes may be unequal within and among trophic levels, potentially impacting the intricate interactions that regulate ecosystem functioning. Here we compile and analyse a global dataset of terrestrial phenological observations, including nearly half a million time series for both plants and animals. Our analysis reveals an increasing phenological asynchronization between plants and animals from 1981 to 2020, with a stronger overall advancement of late-season phenophases for plants than for animals. Almost 30% of temporal variations in plant phenophases can be explained by the timing of the preceding phenophases. This temporal dependency allows the advancement caused by warming to accumulate and propagate through seasons, advancing later phenophases more than earlier phases. By contrast, animals rely on various environmental cues and resource-tracking strategies to initiate their life-cycle activities, which weakens their cross-phenophase linkage and undermines the effect of warming. Our results suggest that future warming may increase phenological asynchronization between plants and animals and potentially disturb trophic interactions and ecosystem stability. Climate change is inducing widespread shifts in the phenology of terrestrial organisms. This global analysis reveals a growing asymmetry between plant and animal responses, with more pronounced phenological shifts in plants.},

  abstract     = {Testing the extent to which ecological communities are structured by deterministic (niche-based) assembly processes, resulting in predictable species abundance and composition, is a fundamental goal of ecology. Here we use a 10-year dataset of 55,156 lianas comprising 86 species in an old-growth tropical forest in Panama to test whether community assembly is consistent with niche-based assembly processes. We find that species diversity and community composition was maintained because species conformed to four general requirements of coexistence theory: (1) species have negative conspecific frequency-dependent feedback that control their local population size; (2) species have a stronger negative effect on their own population than that of heterospecifics; (3) the equilibrium frequencies of species correspond to their relative abundance; and (4) species have positive invasibility. These results indicate that coexistence through deterministic niche-based processes controls local population sizes and prevents any one species from displacing others. Rare species persisted because particularly strong negative feedbacks maintained them at their relatively low equilibrium abundances, thus preventing them from going extinct. Furthermore, we show that it is necessary to use population demography to test coexistence theory because stem mortality alone does not reflect species demography. These findings have broad implications for species coexistence and diversity maintenance in tropical forests and possibly other ecosystems. Ecological communities may arise through distinct assembly processes, which are difficult to disentangle. Here the authors show that deterministic niche-based, not neutral dispersal, assembly processes explain the vast majority of the structure of a tropical forest liana community.},

  abstract     = {Plant communities are composed of species that differ both in functional traits and evolutionary histories. As species’ functional traits partly result from their individual evolutionary history, we expect the functional diversity of communities to increase with increasing phylogenetic diversity. This expectation has only been tested at local scales and generally for specific growth forms or specific habitat types, for example, grasslands. Here we compare standardized effect sizes for functional and phylogenetic diversity among 1,781,836 vegetation plots using the global sPlot database. In contrast to expectations, we find functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity to be only weakly and negatively correlated, implying a decoupling between these two facets of diversity. While phylogenetic diversity is higher in forests and reflects recent climatic conditions (1981 to 2010), functional diversity tends to reflect recent and past climatic conditions (21,000 years ago). The independent nature of functional and phylogenetic diversity makes it crucial to consider both aspects of diversity when analysing ecosystem functioning and prioritizing conservation efforts. Functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity are expected to be positively correlated. Here the authors show that the covariation between these metrics in vascular plant communities around the world is often either inconsistent or negative.},

  abstract     = {Genomic and ancient DNA data have revolutionized palaeoanthropology and our vision of human evolution, with indisputable landmarks like the sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. Yet, using genetic data to identify, date and quantify evolutionary events—such as ancient bottlenecks or admixture—is not straightforward, as inferences may depend on model assumptions. In the last two decades, the idea that Neanderthals and members of the Homo sapiens lineage interbred has gained momentum. From the status of unlikely theory, it has reached consensus among human evolutionary biologists. This theory is mainly supported by statistical approaches that depend on demographic models minimizing or ignoring population structure, despite its widespread occurrence and the fact that, when ignored, population structure can lead to the inference of spurious demographic events. We simulated genomic data under a structured and admixture-free model of human evolution, and found that all the tested admixture approaches identified long Neanderthal fragments in our simulated genomes and an admixture event that never took place. We also observed that several published admixture models failed to predict important empirical diversity or admixture statistics, and that we could identify several scenarios from our structured model that better predicted these statistics jointly. Using a simulated time series of ancient DNA, the structured scenarios could also predict the trajectory of the empirical D statistics. Our results suggest that models accounting for population structure are fundamental to improve our understanding of human evolution, and that admixture between Neanderthals and H. sapiens needs to be re-evaluated in the light of structured models. Beyond the Neanderthal case, we argue that ancient hybridization events, which are increasingly documented in many species, including with other hominins, may also benefit from such re-evaluation. Simulating a metapopulation of human evolution without Neanderthal introgression into Homo sapiens still identifies Neanderthal fragments in simulated genomes, and an admixture event that never took place. This indicates that population structure must be accounted for in human evolutionary genomics and that putative ancient hybridization events should be reinterpreted in this light.},

  abstract     = {Ex situ living plant collections play a crucial role in providing nature-based solutions to twenty-first century global challenges. However, the complex dynamics of these artificial ecosystems are poorly quantified and understood, affecting biodiversity storage, conservation and utilization. To evaluate the management of ex situ plant diversity, we analysed a century of data comprising 2.2 million records, from a meta-collection currently holding ~500,000 accessions and 41% of global ex situ species diversity. Our study provides critical insights into the historical evolution, current state and future trajectory of global living collections. We reveal sigmoidal growth of a meta-collection that has reached capacity in both total accessions and total diversity, and identify intrinsic constraints on biodiversity management, including a median survival probability of 15 years. We explore the impact of external constraints and quantify the influence of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which we link to reduced acquisition of wild-origin and internationally sourced material by 44% and 38%, respectively. We further define the impact of these constraints on ex situ conservation but highlight targeted initiatives that successfully mitigate these challenges. Ultimately, our study underscores the urgent need for strategic prioritization and the re-evaluation of ex situ biodiversity management to achieve both scientific and conservation goals. The authors collate a meta-collection of ex situ living plant diversity held in 50 botanical collections worldwide, spanning a century of data and currently containing ~500,000 accessions. Their analyses examine the capacities and constraints within living plant collections, reveal the impact of the Convention on Biological Diversity and its consequences for material exchange and conservation, and call for the re-evaluation of strategic priorities.},

  abstract     = {Rapid growth in bio-logging—the use of animal-borne electronic tags to document the movements, behaviour, physiology and environments of wildlife—offers opportunities to mitigate biodiversity threats and expand digital natural history archives. Here we present a vision to achieve such benefits by accounting for the heterogeneity inherent to bio-logging data and the concerns of those who collect and use them. First, we can enable data integration through standard vocabularies, transfer protocols and aggregation protocols, and drive their wide adoption. Second, we need to develop integrated data collections on standardized data platforms that support data preservation through public archiving and strategies that ensure long-term access. We outline pathways to reach these goals, highlighting the need for resources to govern community data standards and guide data mobilization efforts. We propose the launch of a community-led coordinating body and provide recommendations for how stakeholders—including government data centres, museums and those who fund, permit and publish bio-logging work—can support these efforts. Animal-borne electronic tags, or bio-loggers, are increasingly used for research and wildlife conservation. This Perspective discusses the importance of standardization, long-term archiving and sharing of bio-logging data, and outlines a roadmap to achieve these goals.},

  abstract     = {The use of herbaria for science and conservation is enabling greatly enhanced scopes and scales of discovery, exploration and protection of biodiversity. The availability of digital, open-access herbarium data is, perhaps counter-intuitively, expanding the use of physical collections by researchers who use digital collections to find specimens and then sample physical collections for multiomics investigations, including genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and microbiomics. These investigations are leading to new scientific insights and supporting the development of conservation actions, but they come with a substantial cost: the partial or complete destruction of often irreplaceable specimens, which constitute a global heritage that should be permanently safeguarded for future reference. Here we provide a set of recommended best practices for the sustainable, equitable and ethical sampling of herbarium specimens. Our recommendations are intended for two complementary and partially overlapping audiences—users and stewards—who together build, use and protect herbarium collections. Greater availability of digital herbarium data is leading to more researchers seeking to sample physical herbarium collections. This Perspective provides recommendations for stewards and users of herbarium collections to ensure optimal preservation of herbarium specimens.},

In particular, large language models introduce a fresh research paradigm to tackle scientific problems from a natural language processing perspective. Large language models significantly enhance our understanding and generation of molecules, often surpassing existing methods with their capabilities to decode and synthesize complex molecular patterns. However, two key issues remain: how to quantify the match between model and data modalities and how to identify the knowledge-learning preferences of models. To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal benchmark, named ChEBI-20-MM, and perform 1,263 experiments to assess the model’s compatibility with data modalities and knowledge acquisition. Through the modal transition probability matrix, we provide insights into the most suitable modalities for tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a statistically interpretable approach to discover context-specific knowledge mapping by localized feature filtering. Our analysis offers an exploration of the learning mechanism and paves the way for advancing large language models in molecular science. Large language models promise substantial advances in molecular modelling and design. A multimodal benchmark is proposed to analyse performance, and 1,263 experiments are conducted to examine the compatibility of a large language model with data modalities and knowledge acquisition.},

Here we introduce centroid- and orientation-aware disentangling autoencoder (CODAE), an encoder–decoder-based neural network that learns meaningful content of objects in a latent space. Specifically, a combination of a translation- and rotation-equivariant encoder, Euler encoding and an image moment loss enables CODAE to extract features invariant to positions and orientations of objects of interest from randomly translated and rotated images. We evaluate this approach on several publicly available scientific datasets, including protein images from life sciences, four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy data from material science and galaxy images from astronomy. The evaluation shows that CODAE learns centroids, orientations and their invariant features and outputs, as well as aligned reconstructions and the exact view reconstructions of the input images with high quality. Cha and colleagues present a translation- and rotation-equivariant autoencoder-based method for robust image recognition, which they demonstrate on diverse tasks from bioinformatics, material science and astronomy.},

We introduce clinical and omics multimodal analysis enhanced with transfer learning (COMET), a machine learning framework that incorporates large, observational electronic health record databases and transfer learning to improve the analysis of small datasets from omics studies. By pretraining on electronic health record data and adaptively blending both early and late fusion strategies, COMET overcomes the limitations of existing multimodal machine learning methods. Using two independent datasets, we showed that COMET improved the predictive modelling performance and biological discovery compared with the analysis of omics data with traditional methods. By incorporating electronic health record data into omics analyses, COMET enables more precise patient classifications, beyond the simplistic binary reduction to cases and controls. This framework can be broadly applied to the analysis of multimodal omics studies and reveals more powerful biological insights from limited cohort sizes. COMET, an artificial intelligence method that improves the analysis of small medical studies using large clinical databases, has been created. COMET can help develop better artificial intelligence tools and identify key biomarkers across many diseases, potentially changing medical research.},

  abstract     = {The immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising clinical efficacy across various tumour types, yet the percentage of patients who benefit from them remains low. The bindings between tumour antigens and human leukocyte antigen class I/T cell receptor molecules determine the antigen presentation and T cell activation, thereby playing an important role in the immunotherapy response. In this paper, we propose UnifyImmun, a unified cross-attention transformer model designed to simultaneously predict the bindings of peptides to both receptors, providing more comprehensive evaluation of antigen immunogenicity. We devise a two-phase strategy using virtual adversarial training that enables these two tasks to reinforce each other mutually, by compelling the encoders to extract more expressive features. Our method demonstrates superior performance in predicting both peptide-HLA and peptide-TCR binding on multiple independent and external test sets. Notably, on a large-scale COVID-19 peptide-TCR binding test set without any seen peptide in the training set, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by more than 10%. The predicted binding scores significantly correlate with the immunotherapy response and clinical outcomes on two clinical cohorts. Furthermore, the cross-attention scores and integrated gradients reveal the amino acid sites critical for peptide binding to receptors. In essence, our approach marks an essential step towards comprehensive evaluation of antigen immunogenicity. This work proposes a deep learning model based on the cross-attention mechanism to simultaneously predict peptide–HLA and peptide–TCR bindings. Experiments verify that its performance for both prediction tasks on multiple test sets compares favourably with previous methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting battery lifetime in early cycles holds tremendous value in real-world applications. However, this task poses significant challenges due to diverse factors influencing complex battery capacity degradation, such as cycling protocols, ambient temperatures and electrode materials. Moreover, cycling under specific conditions is both resource-intensive and time-consuming. Existing predictive models, primarily developed and validated within a restricted set of ageing conditions, thus raise doubts regarding their extensive applicability. Here we introduce BatLiNet, a deep learning framework tailored to predict battery lifetime reliably across a variety of ageing conditions. The distinctive design is integrating an inter-cell learning mechanism to predict the lifetime differences between two battery cells. This mechanism, when combined with conventional single-cell learning, enhances the stability of lifetime predictions for a target cell under varied ageing conditions. Our experimental results, derived from a broad spectrum of ageing conditions, demonstrate BatLiNet’s superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing models. BatLiNet also exhibits transferring capabilities across different battery chemistries, benefitting scenarios with limited resources. We expect this study could promote exploration of cross-cell insights and facilitate battery research across comprehensive ageing factors. Zhang and colleagues introduce an inter-cell learning mechanism to predict battery lifetime in the presence of diverse ageing conditions.},

Although this lifelong learning capability is considered an essential mechanism that makes up general intelligence, recent advancements in artificial intelligence predominantly excel in narrow, specialized domains and generally lack this lifelong learning capability. Here we introduce a robotic lifelong reinforcement learning framework that addresses this gap by developing a knowledge space inspired by the Bayesian non-parametric domain. In addition, we enhance the agent’s semantic understanding of tasks by integrating language embeddings into the framework. Our proposed embodied agent can consistently accumulate knowledge from a continuous stream of one-time feeding tasks. Furthermore, our agent can tackle challenging real-world long-horizon tasks by combining and reapplying its acquired knowledge from the original tasks stream. The proposed framework advances our understanding of the robotic lifelong learning process and may inspire the development of more broadly applicable intelligence. Humans continuously acquire knowledge and develop complex behaviours. Meng, Bing, Yao and colleagues present a robotic lifelong learning framework using a Bayesian non-parametric knowledge space, enabling agents to dynamically preserve and integrate knowledge from sequential tasks, enhancing adaptability.},

It creates molecules through a painting-like approach that simultaneously depicts local structures and global layout of the molecule. By visualizing molecular structures, various design tasks are unified within a single image-based framework. De novo design becomes sketching new molecular images, whereas editing tasks transform into filling partially drawn images.

MUNIS shows improved performance compared with existing models in predicting peptide presentation and CD8+ T cell epitope immunodominance hierarchies. Moreover, application of MUNIS to proteins from Epstein–Barr virus led to successful identification of both established and novel HLA-I epitopes which were experimentally validated by in vitro HLA-I-peptide stability and T cell immunogenicity assays. MUNIS performs comparably to an experimental stability assay in terms of immunogenicity prediction, suggesting that deep learning can reduce experimental burden and accelerate identification of CD8+ T cell epitopes for rapid T cell vaccine development. Accurate prediction of immunogenic CD8+ T cell epitopes would greatly accelerate T cell vaccine development.

  abstract     = {As artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), become increasingly integrated into decision-making processes, the ability to trust their outputs is crucial. To earn human trust, LLMs must be well calibrated such that they can accurately assess and communicate the likelihood of their predictions being correct. Whereas recent work has focused on LLMs’ internal confidence, less is understood about how effectively they convey uncertainty to users. Here we explore the calibration gap, which refers to the difference between human confidence in LLM-generated answers and the models’ actual confidence, and the discrimination gap, which reflects how well humans and models can distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Our experiments with multiple-choice and short-answer questions reveal that users tend to overestimate the accuracy of LLM responses when provided with default explanations. Moreover, longer explanations increased user confidence, even when the extra length did not improve answer accuracy. By adjusting LLM explanations to better reflect the models’ internal confidence, both the calibration gap and the discrimination gap narrowed, significantly improving user perception of LLM accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of accurate uncertainty communication and highlight the effect of explanation length in influencing user trust in artificial-intelligence-assisted decision-making environments. Understanding how people perceive and interpret uncertainty from large language models (LLMs) is crucial, as users often overestimate LLM accuracy, especially with default explanations. Steyvers et al. show that aligning LLM explanations with their internal confidence improves user perception.},

Despite considerable empirical and computational work on goals and goal-oriented behaviour, models are still far from capturing the richness of everyday human goals. Here we bridge this gap by collecting a dataset of human-generated playful goals (in the form of scorable, single-player games), modelling them as reward-producing programs and generating novel human-like goals through program synthesis. Reward-producing programs capture the rich semantics of goals through symbolic operations that compose, add temporal constraints and allow program execution on behavioural traces to evaluate progress. To build a generative model of goals, we learn a fitness function over the infinite set of possible goal programs and sample novel goals with a quality-diversity algorithm. Human evaluators found that model-generated goals, when sampled from partitions of program space occupied by human examples, were indistinguishable from human-created games. We also discovered that our model’s internal fitness scores predict games that are evaluated as more fun to play and more human-like. To enable artificial agents to generate human-like goals, a model must capture the complexity and diversity of human goals. Davidson et al. model playful goals from a naturalistic experiment as reward-producing programs, mapping an agent’s behaviour to goal success. They then develop a computational model to generate diverse human-like goals.},

Although model merging has emerged as a cost-effective promising approach for creating new models by combining existing ones, it currently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its potential. Here we propose an evolutionary approach that overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. Our approach operates in both parameter space and data flow space, allowing optimization beyond just the weights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates cross-domain merging, generating models such as a Japanese LLM with math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing models with substantially more parameters, despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally aware Japanese vision–language model generated through our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese vision–language models. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source community but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation model development.

  abstract     = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and large models are producing realistic outputs across various domains, such as images, text, speech and music. Creating these advanced generative models requires significant resources, particularly large and high-quality datasets. To minimize training expenses, many algorithm developers use data created by the models themselves as a cost-effective training solution. However, not all synthetic data effectively improve model performance, necessitating a strategic balance in the use of real versus synthetic data to optimize outcomes. Currently, the previously well-controlled integration of real and synthetic data is becoming uncontrollable. The widespread and unregulated dissemination of synthetic data online leads to the contamination of datasets traditionally compiled through web scraping, now mixed with unlabelled synthetic data. This trend, known as the AI autophagy phenomenon, suggests a future where generative AI systems may increasingly consume their own outputs without discernment, raising concerns about model performance, reliability and ethical implications. What will happen if generative AI continuously consumes itself without discernment? What measures can we take to mitigate the potential adverse effects? To address these research questions, this Perspective examines the existing literature, delving into the consequences of AI autophagy, analysing the associated risks and exploring strategies to mitigate its impact. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive perspective on this phenomenon advocating for a balanced approach that promotes the sustainable development of generative AI technologies in the era of large models. With widespread generation and availability of synthetic data, AI systems are increasingly trained on their own outputs, leading to various technical and ethical challenges. The authors analyse this development and discuss measures to mitigate the potential adverse effects of ‘AI eating itself’.},

  abstract     = {The γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues enables Ca2+-mediated membrane assembly of protein complexes that support broad physiological functions, including haemostasis, calcium homeostasis, immune response and endocrine regulation1–4. Modulating γ-carboxylation levels provides prevalent treatments for haemorrhagic and thromboembolic diseases5. This unique post-translational modification requires vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) to drive highly demanding reactions6 catalysed by the membrane-integrated γ-carboxylase (VKGC). Here, to decipher the underlying mechanisms, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human VKGC in unbound form, with KH2 and four haemostatic and non-haemostatic proteins possessing propeptides and glutamate-rich domains in different carboxylation states. VKGC recognizes substrate proteins through knob-and-hole interactions with propeptides, thereby bringing tethered glutamate-containing segments for processive carboxylation within a large chamber that provides steric control. Propeptide binding also triggers a global conformational change to signal VKGC activation. Through sequential deprotonation and KH2 epoxidation, VKGC generates a free hydroxide ion as an exceptionally strong base that is required to deprotonate the γ-carbon of glutamate for CO2 addition. The diffusion of this superbase—protected and guided by a sealed hydrophobic tunnel—elegantly resolves the challenge of coupling KH2 epoxidation to γ-carboxylation across the membrane interface. These structural insights and extensive functional experiments advance membrane enzymology and propel the development of treatments for γ-carboxylation disorders. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal the mechanisms underlying multiple-substrate specificity, coupling of epoxidation with carboxylation and allosteric motions during VKGC catalysis, offering potential strategies for targeting haemostatic and non-haemostatic disorders associated with defects in γ-carboxylation.},

This protein catalyses the oxidation of VK hydroquinone to convert specific glutamate residues to γ-carboxyglutamate residues in VK-dependent proteins (VDPs), which are involved in various essential biological processes and diseases1–3. However, the working mechanism of GGCX remains unclear. Here we report three cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human GGCX: in the apo state, bound to osteocalcin (a VDP) and bound to VK. The propeptide of the VDP binds to the lumenal domain of GGCX, which stabilizes transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of GGCX to create the VK-binding pocket. After binding of VK, residue Lys218 in GGCX mediates the oxidation of VK hydroxyquinone, which leads to the deprotonation of glutamate residues and the construction of γ-carboxyglutamate residues. Our structural observations and results from binding and cell&amp;nbsp;biological assays and molecular dynamics simulations show that a cholesterol molecule interacts with the transmembrane helices of GGCX to regulate its protein levels in cells. Together, these results establish a link between cholesterol metabolism and VK-dependent pathways.

Although the function of Spo11 has been known for 27 years, previous efforts to reconstitute DSB formation in vitro have been unsuccessful. Here we biochemically characterize the mouse SPO11–TOP6BL protein complex, and show that this complex cleaves DNA and covalently attaches to the 5′ terminus of DNA breaks in vitro. Using a point-mutation strategy, we reveal that Mg2+ is essential for the DNA-cleavage activity of this complex in vitro, as confirmed by knock-in mice carrying a point mutation in SPO11 that disrupts its binding to Mg2+, thereby abolishing DSB formation. However, the activity of the SPO11 complex is ATP-independent. We also present evidence that the mouse SPO11 complex is biochemically distinct from the ancestral topoisomerase VI. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework for understanding the first steps of meiotic recombination. The in vitro characterization of a key event in the early stages of meiosis—the induction of double-strand DNA breaks by the SPO11–TOP6BL complex—provides insight into the catalytic mechanism and evolution of SPO11.},

  abstract     = {SPO11 initiates meiotic recombination through the induction of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1,2, but this catalytic activity has never been reconstituted in vitro3,4. Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyses break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5′ broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization for the reconstitution of two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyses DNA cleavage with an activity similar to that of SPO11 alone. However, this complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role after cleavage. We propose a model in which additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11–TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs.

  abstract     = {Meiotic recombination starts with SPO11 generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)1. SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species, but it generates dangerous DSBs with mutagenic2 and gametocidal3 potential. Cells must therefore utilize the beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks4—how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to TOP6BL. SPO11–TOP6BL complexes are monomeric (1:1) in solution and bind tightly to DNA, but dimeric (2:2) assemblies cleave DNA to form covalent 5′ attachments that require SPO11 active-site residues, divalent metal ions and SPO11 dimerization. SPO11 can also reseal DNA that it has nicked. Structure modelling with AlphaFold 3 suggests that DNA is bent prior to cleavage5. In vitro cleavage displays a sequence bias that partially explains DSB site preferences in vivo. Cleavage is inefficient on complex DNA substrates, partly because SPO11 is readily trapped in DSB-incompetent (presumably monomeric) binding states that exchange slowly. However, cleavage is improved with substrates that favour dimer assembly or by artificially dimerizing SPO11. Our results inform a model in which intrinsically weak dimerization restrains SPO11 activity in vivo, making it exquisitely dependent on accessory proteins that focus and control DSB formation. Reconstitution of recombinantly expressed SPO11–TOP6BL complex recapitulates its DNA cleavage function and together with structural modelling and biochemical experiments, provides insights into the regulation and mechanism of SPO11 activity.},

Here, using 18 single, double and triple whole-body and tissue-specific knockout and mutant mice, along with systematic mitochondrial morphology analysis, untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing, we discovered that the synergy between two stress-responsive systems—the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin and the metalloprotease OMA1—safeguards mitochondrial structure and genome by mitochondrial fusion, mediated by the outer membrane GTPase MFN1 and the inner membrane GTPase OPA1. Whereas the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses. Thus, our data show that Parkin and OMA1 maintain a dual regulatory mechanism that controls mitochondrial fusion at the two membranes, even in the absence of extrinsic stress. We find that, in mice, although the individual loss of Parkin or OMA1 does not affect mitochondrial integrity, their combined loss results in small body size, low locomotor activity, premature death, mitochondrial abnormalities and innate immune responses.},

  abstract     = {Elevated or ectopic expression of neuronal receptors promotes tumour progression in many cancer types1,2; neuroendocrine (NE) transformation of adenocarcinomas has also been associated with increased aggressiveness3. Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells4,5. Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte–neuron metabolite shuttle6. Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential. Electrical excitability in neuroendocrine SCLC cells promotes tumour progression through action potential firing, increasing ATP demand and oxidative phosphorylation dependency, whereas non-neuroendocrine cells provide metabolic support, driving a tumour-autonomous cycle that enhances tumorigenesis and metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide1,2. HCC occurs typically from a background of chronic liver disease, caused by a spectrum of predisposing conditions. Tumour development is driven by the expansion of clones that&amp;nbsp;accumulate progressive driver mutations3, with hepatocytes the most likely cell of origin2. However, the landscape of driver mutations in HCC is broadly independent of the underlying aetiologies4. Despite an increasing range of systemic treatment options for advanced HCC, outcomes remain heterogeneous and typically poor. Emerging data suggest that drug efficacies depend on disease aetiology and genetic alterations5,6. Exploring subtypes in preclinical models with human relevance will therefore be essential to advance precision medicine in HCC7. Here we generated a suite of genetically driven immunocompetent in vivo and matched in vitro HCC models. Our models represent multiple features of human HCC, including clonal origin, histopathological appearance and metastasis. We integrated transcriptomic data from the mouse models with human HCC data and identified four common human–mouse subtype clusters. The subtype clusters had distinct transcriptomic characteristics that aligned with the human histopathology. In a proof-of-principle analysis, we verified response to standard-of-care treatment&amp;nbsp;and used a linked in vitro–in vivo pipeline&amp;nbsp;to identify a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, that has not previously been linked to HCC treatment. Cladribine acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy. As proof of principle, an analysis using a suite of human-aligned&amp;nbsp;immunocompetent mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma identifies a promising therapeutic candidate, cladribine, which acts in a highly effective subtype-specific manner in combination with standard-of-care therapy.},

  abstract     = {Although cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for anti-tumour immunity, they are frequently dysfunctional in tumours1. Cytokines that sustain CTL activity are attractive for cancer immunotherapy, but avoiding inflammatory toxicity remains a challenge for their clinical use2. Here we show that expression of a CTL signature is strongly associated with IL27 expression in human and mouse tumours. In mice, IL-27 acts directly on tumour-specific CTLs to promote their persistence and effector function in the tumour microenvironment. Moreover, treatment with inducible IL-27 overexpression or a half-life-extended IL-27 protein in vivo is well tolerated, induces regression of established tumours, drives an enhanced cytotoxic program in anti-tumour CTLs and synergizes with PD-L1 blockade. In patients with cancer who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, high expression of IL-27 correlates with a favourable clinical response, and IL-27 supports human CTL function during chronic antigen stimulation ex vivo. Our data demonstrate that endogenous IL-27 is essential for anti-tumour immunity and that IL-27 receptor agonism can safely improve anti-tumour T cell responses alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade. IL-27 promotes tumour control by preventing dysfunction and enhancing cytotoxicity of tumour-specific CD8+ T cells.},

  abstract     = {The development of animal models is crucial for studying and treating mitochondrial diseases. Here we optimized adenine and cytosine deaminases to reduce off-target effects on the transcriptome and the mitochondrial genome, improving the accuracy and efficiency of our newly developed mitochondrial base editors (mitoBEs)1. Using these upgraded mitoBEs (version 2 (v2)), we targeted 70 mouse mitochondrial DNA mutations analogous to human pathogenic variants2, establishing a foundation for mitochondrial disease mouse models. Circular RNA-encoded mitoBEs v2 achieved up to 82% editing efficiency in mice without detectable off-target effects in the nuclear genome. The edited mitochondrial DNA persisted across various tissues and was maternally inherited, resulting in F1 generation mice with mutation loads as high as 100% and some mice exhibiting editing only at the target site. By optimizing the transcription activator-like effector (TALE)&amp;nbsp;binding site, we developed a single-base-editing mouse model for the mt-Nd5 A12784G mutation. Phenotypic evaluations led to the creation of mouse models for the mt-Atp6 T8591C and mt-Nd5 A12784G mutations, exhibiting phenotypes corresponding to the reduced heart rate seen in Leigh syndrome and the vision loss characteristic of Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, respectively. Moreover, the mt-Atp6 T8591C mutation proved to be more deleterious than mt-Nd5 A12784G, affecting embryonic development and rapidly diminishing through successive generations. These upgraded mitoBEs offer a highly efficient and precise strategy for constructing mitochondrial disease models, laying a foundation for further research in this field. A study reports optimized mitochondrial base editors with reduced off-target effects to facilitate the generation of mouse models of human mitochondrial diseases.},

  abstract     = {Caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) and pyrin domains are important facilitators of inflammasome activity and pyroptosis1. Following pathogen recognition by nucleotide binding-domain, leucine-rich, repeat-containing (NLR)&amp;nbsp;proteins, CARDs recruit and activate caspases, which, in turn, activate gasdermin pore-forming proteins to induce pyroptotic cell death2. Here we show that CARD domains are present in defence systems that protect bacteria against phage. The bacterial CARD domain is essential for protease-mediated activation of certain bacterial gasdermins, which promote cell death once phage infection is recognized. We further show that multiple anti-phage defence systems use CARD domains to activate a variety of cell death effectors, and that CARD domains mediate protein–protein interactions in these systems. We find that these systems are triggered by a conserved immune-evasion protein used by phages to overcome the bacterial defence system RexAB3, demonstrating that phage proteins inhibiting one defence system can activate another. Our results suggest that CARD domains represent an ancient component of innate immune systems conserved from bacteria to humans, and that CARD-dependent activation of gasdermins is shared in organisms across the tree of life.

  abstract     = {Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning&amp;nbsp;(RL)1. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum2, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions3. Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated. In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding. Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively. We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons4–9 to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL. D1- and D2-expressing striatal neurons encode separate parts of a learned reward distribution, paralleling modern approaches in machine learning.},

  abstract     = {The hypothalamus is a brain region that plays a key role in coordinating fundamental biological functions1. However, our understanding of the underlying cellular components and neurocircuitries have, until recently, emerged primarily from rodent studies2,3. Here we combine single-nucleus sequencing of 433,369 human hypothalamic cells with spatial transcriptomics, generating a comprehensive spatio-cellular transcriptional map of the hypothalamus, the ‘HYPOMAP’. Although conservation of neuronal cell types between humans and mice, as&amp;nbsp;based on transcriptomic identity, is generally high, there are notable exceptions. Specifically, there are significant disparities in the identity of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and in the expression levels of G-protein-coupled receptors between the two species that carry direct implications for currently approved obesity treatments. Out of the 452 hypothalamic cell types, we find that&amp;nbsp;291 neuronal clusters are significantly enriched for expression of body mass index (BMI) genome-wide association study genes. This enrichment is driven by 426 ‘effector’ genes. Rare deleterious variants in six of these (MC4R, PCSK1, POMC, CALCR, BSN and CORO1A) associate with BMI at population level, and CORO1A has not been linked previously to BMI. Thus, HYPOMAP provides a detailed atlas of the human hypothalamus in a spatial context and serves as an important resource to identify new druggable targets for treating a wide range of conditions, including reproductive, circadian and metabolic disorders. HYPOMAP integrates single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data to create a comprehensive spatio-cellular map of the human hypothalamus.},

  abstract     = {Human recombination maps are a valuable resource for association and linkage studies and crucial for many inferences of population history and natural selection. Existing maps1–5 are based solely on cross-over (CO) recombination, omitting non-cross-overs (NCOs)—the more common form of recombination6—owing to the difficulty in detecting them. Using whole-genome sequence data in families, we estimate the number of NCOs transmitted from parent to offspring and derive complete, sex-specific recombination maps including both NCOs and COs. Mothers have fewer but longer NCOs than fathers, and oocytes accumulate NCOs in a non-regulated fashion with maternal age. Recombination, primarily NCO, is responsible for 1.8% (95% confidence interval: 1.3–2.3) and 11.3% (95% confidence interval: 9.0–13.6) of paternal and maternal de novo mutations, respectively, and may drive the increase in de novo mutations with maternal age. NCOs are substantially more prominent than COs in centromeres, possibly to avoid large-scale genomic changes that may cause aneuploidy. Our results demonstrate that NCOs highlight to a much greater extent than COs the differences in the meiotic process between the sexes, in which maternal NCOs may reflect the safeguarding of oocytes from infancy until ovulation. Complete human recombination maps are presented that enable exploration of both cross-over and non-cross-over events during meiosis, with the potential to provide insight into the causes of aneuploidies and pregnancy loss.},

  abstract     = {Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is widespread across eukaryotes and can promote adaptive evolution1–4. However, given the instability of newly formed polyploid genomes5–7, understanding how WGDs arise in a population, persist, and underpin adaptations remains a challenge. Here, using our ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE)8, we show that diploid snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under selection for larger multicellular size rapidly evolve to be tetraploid. From their origin within the first 50 days of the experiment, tetraploids persisted for the next 950 days (nearly 5,000 generations, the current leading edge of our experiment) in 10 replicate populations, despite being genomically unstable. Using synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modelling and counter-selection, we found that tetraploidy evolved because it confers immediate fitness benefits under this selection, by producing larger, longer cells that yield larger clusters. The same selective benefit also maintained tetraploidy over long evolutionary timescales, inhibiting the reversion to diploidy that is typically seen in laboratory evolution experiments. Once established, tetraploidy facilitated novel genetic routes for adaptation, having a key role in the evolution of macroscopic multicellular size via the origin of evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy. These results provide unique empirical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and impacts of WGD, showing how it can initially arise due to its immediate adaptive benefits, be maintained by selection and fuel long-term innovations by creating additional dimensions of heritable genetic variation. In the Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment, diploid yeast evolve to be tetraploid under selection for larger multicellular size, revealing how whole-genome duplication can arise due to its immediate benefits, persist under selection, and fuel long-term innovations via aneuploidy.},

  abstract     = {How new structures emerge during evolution has long fascinated biologists. An example is how the diminutive bones of the mammalian middle ear arose from ancestral fish jawbones1. By contrast, the evolutionary origin of the outer ear, another mammalian innovation, remains a mystery, partly because it is supported by non-mineralized elastic cartilage, which is rarely recovered in fossils. Whether the outer ear arose de novo or through the reuse of ancestral developmental programs has remained unknown. Here we show that the outer ear shares gene regulatory programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians for both its initial outgrowth and the later development of the elastic cartilage. Comparative single-nucleus multiomics of the human outer ear and zebrafish gills reveals conserved gene expression and putative enhancers enriched for common transcription factor binding motifs. This is reflected by the transgenic activity of human outer-ear enhancers in gills, and of fish gill enhancers in the outer ear. Furthermore, single-cell multiomics of the cartilaginous book gills of horseshoe crabs reveals a&amp;nbsp;developmental program shared with the distal-less homeobox (DLX)-mediated gill program of vertebrates, with a book-gill distal-less enhancer driving expression in zebrafish gills. We propose that elements of an invertebrate gill program were reutilized in vertebrates to generate first gills and then the outer ear. A study on the evolutionary origin of the mammalian outer ear finds that it shares genetic programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians, indicating that elements of an ancestral gill have been reused.},

Here we surveyed children in Kolkata and Delhi, India, who work in markets (n = 1,436), to investigate whether maths skills acquired in real-world settings transfer to the classroom and vice versa. Nearly all these children used complex arithmetic calculations effectively at work. They were also proficient in solving hypothetical market maths problems and verbal maths problems that were anchored to concrete contexts. However, they were unable to solve arithmetic problems of equal or lesser complexity when presented in the abstract format typically used in school. The children’s performance in market maths problems was not explained by memorization, access to help, reduced stress with more familiar formats or high incentives for correct performance. By contrast, children with no market-selling experience (n = 471), enrolled in nearby schools, showed the opposite pattern. These children performed more accurately on simple abstract problems, but only 1% could correctly answer an applied market maths problem that more than one third of working children solved (β = 0.35, s.e.m. = 0.03; 95% confidence interval = 0.30–0.40, P &amp;lt; 0.001). School children used highly inefficient written calculations, could not combine different operations and arrived at answers too slowly to be useful in real-life or in higher maths. These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal maths.

  abstract     = {Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding1. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns2, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe3. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy&amp;nbsp;rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers. Long-term increases in heavy daily and hourly precipitation in Austria from different climatic mechanisms emphasize the need for flood management adaptation, especially in smaller catchments affected by the increased hourly rainfall.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art climate models project a substantial decline in precipitation for the Mediterranean region in the future1. Supporting this notion, several studies based on observed precipitation data spanning recent decades have suggested a decrease in Mediterranean precipitation2–4, with some attributing a large fraction of this change to anthropogenic influences3,5. Conversely, certain researchers have underlined that Mediterranean precipitation exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variability driven by atmospheric circulation patterns6,7 maintaining stationarity over the long term8,9. These conflicting perspectives underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes in this region, given the profound social, economic and environmental implications. Here we show that Mediterranean precipitation has largely remained stationary&amp;nbsp;from 1871 to 2020, albeit with significant multi-decadal and interannual variability. This conclusion is based on the most comprehensive dataset available for the region, encompassing over 23,000 stations across 27 countries. While trends can be identified for some periods and subregions, our findings attribute these trends primarily to atmospheric dynamics, which would be mostly linked to internal variability. Furthermore, our assessment reconciles the observed precipitation trends with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations, neither of which indicate a prevailing past precipitation trend in the region. The implications of our results extend to environmental, agricultural and water resources planning in one of the world’s prominent climate change hotspots10. Our assessment of a 27-country weather station dataset in the Mediterranean region revealed long-term stability in precipitation over 150 years, along with substantial short-term variability on annual to decadal scales driven by atmospheric circulation; these findings align with the precipitation trends seen in&amp;nbsp;CMIP6 models.},

  abstract     = {Rates of relative sea-level rise during the final stage of the last deglaciation, the early Holocene, are key to understanding future ice melt and sea-level change under a warming climate1. Data about these rates are scarce2, and this limits insight into the relative contributions of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets to global sea-level rise during the early Holocene. Here we present an early Holocene sea-level curve based on 88 sea-level data points (13.7–6.2 thousand years ago (ka)) from the North Sea (Doggerland3,4). After removing the pattern of regional glacial isostatic adjustment caused by the melting of the Eurasian Ice Sheet, the residual sea-level signal highlights two phases of accelerated sea-level rise. Meltwater sourced from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets drove these two phases, peaking around 10.3 ka and 8.3 ka with rates between 8 mm yr−1 and 9 mm yr−1. Our results also show that global mean sea-level rise between 11 ka and 3 ka amounted to 37.7 m (2σ range, 29.3–42.2 m), reconciling the mismatch that existed between estimates of global mean sea-level rise based on ice-sheet reconstructions and previously limited early Holocene sea-level data. With its broad spatiotemporal coverage, the North Sea dataset provides critical constraints on the patterns and rates of the late-stage deglaciation of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets, improving our understanding of the Earth-system response to climate change. An early Holocene sea-level curve based on data from the North Sea reveals two phases of accelerated sea-level rise owing to meltwater from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets.},

  abstract     = {The Antarctic ozone ‘hole’ was discovered in 1985 (ref. 1) and man-made ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are its primary cause2. Following reductions of ODSs under the Montreal Protocol3, signs of ozone recovery have been reported, based largely on observations and broad yet compelling model–data comparisons4. Although such approaches are highly valuable, they do not provide rigorous statistical detection of the temporal and spatial structure of Antarctic ozone recovery in the presence of internal climate variability. Here we apply pattern-based detection and attribution methods as used in climate-change studies5–11 to separate anthropogenically forced ozone responses from internal variability, relying on trend pattern information as a function of month and height. The analysis uses satellite observations together with single-model and multi-model ensemble simulations to identify and quantify the month–height Antarctic ozone recovery ‘fingerprint’12. We demonstrate that the data and simulations show compelling agreement in the fingerprint pattern of the ozone response to decreasing ODSs since 2005. We also show that ODS forcing has enhanced ozone internal variability during the austral spring, influencing detection of forced responses and their time of emergence. Our results provide robust statistical and physical evidence that actions taken under the Montreal Protocol to reduce ODSs are indeed resulting in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery, defined as increases in ozone consistent with expected month–height patterns. Pattern-based detection and attribution methods that make use of trend pattern information as a function of month and height provide evidence that reduction of ozone-depleting substances has resulted in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery.},

These qualities make them ideal for lightweight, miniaturized and multi-functional structures3–8. However, achieving high enthalpy is&amp;nbsp;challenging, as it requires combining conflicting properties: high stiffness, high strength and large recoverable strain9–11. Here, to address this challenge, we construct high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials from freely rotatable chiral metacells. Compared with existing non-chiral lattices, the non-optimized chiral metamaterials simultaneously maintain high stiffness, sustain larger recoverable strain, offer a wider buckling plateau, improve the buckling strength by 5–10 times, enhance enthalpy by 2–160 times and increase energy per mass by 2–32 times. These improvements arise from torsional buckling deformation that is triggered by chirality and is absent in conventional metamaterials. This deformation mode stores considerable additional energy while having a minimal impact on peak stresses that define material failure. Our findings identify a mechanism and provide insight into the design of metamaterials and structures with high mechanical energy storage capacity, a fundamental and general problem of broad engineering interest. High-enthalpy elastic metamaterials constructed from freely rotatable chiral metacells have high stiffness, large recoverable strain and improved buckling strength.},

  abstract     = {The electroluminescence performance of heavy-metal-free blue quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) is much lower than that of state-of-the-art cadmium-based counterparts. Ecofriendly ZnSeTe QDs are an ideal alternative to cadmium-based blue QDs1,2, but face issues with colour impurity and inferior stability caused by the aggregated tellurium (Ten≥2) that dominates compositional inhomogeneity3,4. Here we developed an isoelectronic control strategy using congeneric sulfur coordinated with triphenyl phosphite (TPP-S) to construct homogeneous ZnSeTeS QDs with pure-blue emissions and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. TPP with low electron-donating capability promotes the reactivity balance among anionic precursors, favouring the growth of QDs with uniform composition. The acceptor-like S with high electronegativity weakens the hole localization of the Te atoms by interfering with their surrounding carriers, thereby suppressing the formation of Ten≥2 isoelectronic centres. Furthermore, the congeneric S increases the configurational entropy of the QDs and eliminates the stacking faults and oxygen defects, leading to improved structural stability and reduced non-radiative carrier density. Consequently, the resulting pure-blue QLEDs based on core–shell ZnSeTeS/ZnSe/ZnS QDs emitting at 460 nm show a high external quantum efficiency of 24.7%, a narrow linewidth of 17 nm, and long operational half-lifetime (T50) close to 30,000 hours at 100 cd cm−2, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue QLEDs. By suppressing compositional heterogeneities in cadmium-free quantum dots, environmentally friendly pure-blue-light-emitting diodes with enhanced efficiencies, lifetimes and spectral purity are achieved, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue quantum-dot light-emitting diodes.},

After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully generates stable, new materials with desired chemistry, symmetry and mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. As a proof of concept, we synthesize one of the generated structures and measure its property value to be within 20% of our target. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of abilities of MatterGen represent an important advancement towards creating a foundational generative model for materials design.

Floating&amp;nbsp;point (FP) computation provides precision exceeding that of integer (INT) formats at the cost of higher power and storage overhead. Multi-level-cell (MLC) memristor compute-in-memory (CIM)13–15 provides compact non-volatile storage and energy-efficient computation but is prone to accuracy loss owing to process variation. Digital static random-access memory (SRAM)-CIM16–22 enables lossless computation; however, storage is low as a result of large bit-cell area and model loading is required during inference. Thus, conventional approaches using homogeneous CIM architectures and computation formats impose a trade-off between efficiency, storage, wakeup latency and inference accuracy. Here we present a mixed-precision heterogeneous CIM AI edge processor, which supports the layer-granular/kernel-granular partitioning of network layers among on-chip CIM architectures (that is, memristor-CIM, SRAM-CIM and tiny-digital units) and computation number formats (INT and FP) based on sensitivity to error. This layer-granular/kernel-granular flexibility allows simultaneous optimization within the two-dimensional design space at the hardware level. The proposed hardware achieved high energy efficiency (40.91 TFLOPS W−1 for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and 28.63 TFLOPS W−1 for MobileNet-v2 with ImageNet), low accuracy degradation (&amp;lt;0.45% for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and for MobilNet-v2 with ImageNet) and rapid&amp;nbsp;wakeup-to-response time (373.52 μs).

So far, these systems are primarily handcrafted by domain experts and tweaked through heuristics rather than being automatically optimized, presenting a substantial challenge to accelerating progress. The development of artificial neural networks faced a similar challenge until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turnkey. Analogously, here we introduce TextGrad, a versatile framework that performs optimization by backpropagating LLM-generated feedback to improve AI systems. By leveraging natural language feedback to critique and suggest improvements to any part of a system—from prompts to outputs such as molecules or treatment plans—TextGrad enables the automatic optimization of generative AI systems across diverse tasks. We demonstrate TextGrad’s generality and effectiveness through studies in solving PhD-level science problems, optimizing plans for radiotherapy treatments, designing molecules with specific properties, coding, and optimizing agentic systems. TextGrad empowers scientists and engineers to easily develop impactful generative AI systems. Generative artificial intelligence (AI)&amp;nbsp;systems can be optimized using TextGrad, a framework that performs optimization by backpropagating large-language-model-generated feedback; TextGrad enables optimization across diverse tasks, including radiotherapy treatment plans and molecule generation.},

Intuitively, disorder is considered detrimental, requiring efforts to mitigate its effects in conventional topological photonics6–9. We propose a counter-intuitive approach that exploits a real–momentum topological photonic crystal that harnesses real-space disorder to generate a Pancharatnam–Berry phase10,11, without disrupting the momentum-space singularity originating from bound states in the continuum12. This methodology allows flat optical devices to encode spatial information or even extra topological charge in real space while preserving the topology of bound states in the continuum in momentum space with inherent alignment. Here, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous and independent generation of a real-space broadband vortex or a holographic image alongside resonant momentum-space vortex beams with a narrow bandwidth, which cannot be achieved with conventional methods. Such engineered disorder contributes to vast intrinsic freedoms without adding extra dimensions or compromising the optical flatness13,14. Our findings of real–momentum duality not only lay the foundation for disorder engineering in topological photonics but also open new avenues for optical wavefront shaping, encryption and communications. A real–momentum topological photonic crystal that harnesses real-space disorder is used to generate a Pancharatnam–Berry phase while preserving momentum-space topology.},

  abstract     = {From experimental evolution in the laboratory to sustained measurements of natural selection in the wild, long-term studies have revolutionized our understanding of evolution. By directly investigating evolutionary dynamics in real time, these approaches have provided unparallelled insights into the complex interplay between evolutionary process and pattern. These approaches can reveal oscillations, stochastic fluctuations and systematic trends that unfold over extended periods, expose critical time lags between environmental shifts and population responses, and illuminate how subtle effects may accumulate into significant evolutionary patterns. Long-term studies can also reveal otherwise cryptic trends that unfold over extended periods, and offer the potential for serendipity: observing rare events that spur new evolutionary hypotheses and research directions. Despite the challenges of conducting long-term research, exacerbated by modern funding landscapes favouring short-term projects, the contributions of long-term studies to evolutionary biology are indispensable. This is particularly true in our rapidly changing, human-dominated world, where such studies offer a crucial window into how environmental changes and altered species interactions shape evolutionary trajectories. In this Review article, we showcase the groundbreaking discoveries of long-term evolutionary studies, underscoring their crucial role in advancing our understanding of the complex nature of evolution across multiple systems and timescales. Long-term studies provide insights into the complex interplay between evolutionary process and pattern across multiple systems and timescales.},

  abstract     = {The creation of hosts capable of accommodating different guest molecules may enable these hosts to play useful roles in chemical purifications, among other applications. Metal–organic cages are excellent hosts for various guests, but they generally incorporate rigid structural units that hinder dynamic adaptation to specific guests. Here we report a conformationally adaptable pseudo-cubic cage that can dynamically increase its cavity volume to fit guests with differing sizes. This pseudo-cube incorporates a tetramine subcomponent with 2,6-naphthalene arms that cooperatively adopt a non-planar conformation, enabling the cage faces to switch between endo and exo states. A wide range of guest molecules were observed to bind within the cavity of this cage, spanning a range of sizes from 46% to 154% of the cavity volume of the empty cage. Experimental and computational evidence characterizes the flipping of cage faces from endo to exo, expanding the cavity upon binding of larger guests. Synthetic nanocages that can adapt the size and shape of their cavity in response to a given guest have potential applications in various areas, including chemical purification. Now a flexible, pseudo-cubic metal–organic cage has been developed that is able to dynamically expand its cavity from 46% to 154% of its initial volume by flipping its cage faces.},

Natural vesicles are composed of a lipid layer that forms a membrane for the enclosure of substances inside. Here we report a coacervate vesicle formed by the liquid–liquid phase separation of cholesterol-modified DNA and histones. Unlike a phospholipid-based membrane-bounded vesicle, a coacervate vesicle lacks a membrane structure on the surface and is organized with a high-density liquid layer and a water-filled cavity. Through a straightforward coacervation process, we demonstrate that various biological agents, including virus particles, mRNA, cytokines and peptides, can be innocuously and directly enriched in the liquid phase. In contrast to the droplet-like coacervates that are prone to aggregation challenges, coacervate vesicles display superior kinetic stability, positioning them as a versatile delivery vehicle for biopharmaceuticals. We validate that incorporating oncolytic viruses into these coacervate vesicles endows them with potent oncolytic efficacy and elicits robust anti-tumour immune responses in mouse models. Natural vesicles typically consist of a lipid membrane enclosing substances. Now a coacervate vesicle formed by liquid–liquid phase separation of cholesterol-modified DNA and histones has been developed. Unlike traditional vesicles, these lack a membrane and feature a high-density liquid layer around a water-filled cavity, offering enhanced kinetic stability and potential as a biopharmaceutical delivery system.},

Transition-metal catalysis has the potential to greatly expand the scope of nucleophilic substitution reactions of alkyl electrophiles; unfortunately, in the case of alkyl amines as nucleophiles, only one success has been described so far: the selective mono-alkylation of primary amines to form secondary amines. Here, using photoinduced copper catalysis, we report the synthesis of tertiary alkyl amines from secondary amines and unactivated alkyl electrophiles, two readily available coupling partners. Utilizing an array of tools, we have analysed the mechanism of this process; specifically, we have structurally characterized the three principal copper-based intermediates that are detected during catalysis and provided support for the key steps of the proposed catalytic cycle, including the coupling of a copper(II)–amine intermediate with an alkyl radical to form a C–N bond. Alkyl amines are found in a wide array of bioactive compounds, making strategies for their synthesis very important. Now, a method has been developed to synthesize tertiary alkyl amines via photoinduced, copper-catalysed nucleophilic substitution of unactivated alkyl halides by secondary alkyl amines, with key copper intermediates elucidated in a detailed mechanistic study.},

  abstract     = {The chemistry of low-valent bismuth compounds has recently unlocked new concepts in catalysis and unique electronic structure fundamentals. In this work, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a highly reduced bismuth salt featuring a cationic core based on three contiguous Bi(I) centres. The triatomic bismuth-based core exhibits an electronic configuration that mimics the canonical description of the archetypical carbon-based π-allyl cation. Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical analyses validate the unique π-delocalization between the bismuth’s highly diffused 6p orbitals, resulting in a bonding situation in which the three bismuth atoms are interconnected by two bonds, formally possessing a 1.5 bond order each. This electronic situation defines this complex as the heaviest and stable π-allyl cation of the periodic table. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the newly synthesized complex is able to act as a synthon for the transfer of a Bi(I) cation to forge other low-valent organobismuth complexes. Heavier analogues of unsaturated organic molecules are of interest because of their bonding situation and their potential use in synthesis. Now, a Bi(I)-based allyl cation, which can be seen as a heavy congener of all-carbon π-allyl cations, has been reported. This complex serves as a synthon for Bi(I) transfer, enabling access to low-valent organobismuth compounds.},

  abstract     = {The biosynthesis of the lincosamide antibiotics lincomycin A and celesticetin involves the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes LmbF and CcbF, which are responsible for bifurcation of the biosynthetic pathways. Despite recognizing the same S-glycosyl-l-cysteine structure of the substrates, LmbF catalyses thiol formation through β-elimination, whereas CcbF produces S-acetaldehyde through decarboxylation-coupled oxidative deamination. The structural basis for the diversification mechanism remains largely unexplored. Here we conduct structure–function analyses of LmbF and CcbF. X-ray crystal structures, docking and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that active-site aromatic residues play important roles in controlling the substrate binding mode and the reaction outcome. Furthermore, the reaction selectivity and oxygen-utilization of LmbF and CcbF were rationally engineered through structure- and calculation-based mutagenesis. Thus, the catalytic function of CcbF was switched to that of LmbF, and, remarkably, both LmbF and CcbF variants gained the oxidative-amidation activity to produce an unnatural S-acetamide derivative of lincosamide. The reaction mechanisms of the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes LmbF and CcbF—involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic lincosamide—are characterized here. Structure–function analyses reveal structural features responsible for S-alkyl moiety diversification in lincosamides. Using structure- and calculation-based enzyme engineering, the selectivity profiles of these enzymes are designed to generate an unnatural lincosamide derivative.},

However, the role of anions in the formation of the solid–electrolyte interphase remains unclear. Here we combine electrochemical analyses and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, both with and without sample washing, together with computational simulations, to propose the reaction pathways of electrolyte decomposition and correlate the interphase component solubility with the efficacy of passivation. We discover that not all the products derived from interphase-forming reactions are incorporated into the resulting passivation layer, with a notable portion present in the liquid electrolyte. We also find that the high-performance electrolytes can afford a sufficiently passivating interphase with minimized electrolyte decomposition, by incorporating more anion-decomposition products. Overall, this work presents a systematic approach of coupling electrochemical and surface analyses to paint a comprehensive picture of solid–electrolyte interphase formation, while identifying the key attributes of high-performance electrolytes to guide future designs. Li-metal batteries often utilize liquid electrolytes that yield a solid–electrolyte interphase on electrodes; however, the role of anions in interphase formation remains unclear. Now it has been shown that anion-decomposition products provide varying contributions to interphase formation and that high-performance electrolytes balance effective interfacial passivation with minimized degradation.},

De novo peptide structures could be built by combining enzymes from different pathways, but determining the rules of their use is difficult. We present a biophysical model to combine enzymes sourced from bacterial ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) gene clusters. Using a pipeline to evaluate more than 1,000 peptides, the model was parameterized under uniform conditions in Escherichia coli for enzymes from different classes (graspetide, spliceotide, pantocin, cyanobactin, glycocin, lasso peptide and lanthipeptide). Synthetic leader peptides with recognition sequences for up to three enzymes were designed to modify core sequences sharing no identity to natural RiPPs. Empirically, RiPPs with the desired modifications constituted 7–67% of the total peptides produced, and 6 of our 8 peptide designs were successfully modified. This work is an example of the design of enzyme-modified peptides and libraries, using a framework that can be expanded to include new enzymes and chemical moieties. Combining enzymes from different pathways in nature could enable de novo peptide design, but determining enzyme-specificity rules is non-trivial. Here a biophysical model combining enzymes sourced from bacterial ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) gene clusters was generated to formalize enzyme-specificity rules and create peptide scaffolds with defined post-translational modifications.},

  abstract     = {sp2-carbon-linked covalent organic frameworks (sp2c-COFs) are crystalline porous polymers with repeat organic units linked by sp2 carbons, and have attracted increasing interest due to their robust skeleton and tunable semiconducting properties. Single-crystalline sp2c-COFs with well-defined structures can represent an ideal platform for investigating fundamental physics properties and device performance. However, the robust olefin bonds inhibit the reversible-reaction-based crystal self-correction, thus yielding polycrystalline or amorphous polymers. Here we report an imine-to-olefin transformation strategy to form single-crystal sp2c-COFs. The isolated single crystals display rectangular nanotube-like domains with sizes up to approximately 24 μm × 0.8 μm × 0.8 μm, and permanent pore distribution around 1.1 nm. The highly conjugated olefin linkage endows the crystals with enhanced electronic connectivity which determines a remarkable room-temperature metal-free ferromagnetism (8.6 × 10−3 emu g−1). Our protocol is robust and generally applicable for the synthesis of single-crystalline sp2c-COFs for future spin-electron devices. Olefin-linked covalent organic frameworks are materials with potential application as organic semiconductors, but their synthesis remains challenging.

Here we report the enantiodivergent dearomative skeletal editing of indoles and pyrroles via an asymmetric carbon-atom insertion, using trifluoromethyl N-triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursors. This strategy provides a straightforward methodology to access enantiomerically enriched six-membered N-heterocycles containing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocentre from planar N-heteroarenes. The synthetic utility of this enantiodivergent methodology was demonstrated by a broad evaluation of reaction scope, product derivatization and concise syntheses of drug analogues. Mechanistic studies reveal that the excellent asymmetric induction arises from the initial cyclopropanation step. The asymmetric single-atom insertion strategy is expected to have a broad impact on the field of single-atom skeletal editing and catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of aromatic compounds.

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamics of membrane protein–ligand interactions within a native lipid bilayer is a major goal for drug discovery. Typically, cell-based assays are used, however, they are often blind to the effects of protein modifications. In this study, using the archetypal G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin, we found that the receptor and its effectors can be released directly from retina rod disc membranes using infrared irradiation in a mass spectrometer. Subsequent isolation and dissociation by infrared multiphoton dissociation enabled the sequencing of individual retina proteoforms. Specifically, we categorized distinct proteoforms of rhodopsin, localized labile palmitoylations, discovered a Gβγ proteoform that abolishes membrane association and defined lipid modifications on G proteins that influence their assembly. Given reports of undesirable side-effects involving vision, we characterized the off-target drug binding of two phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, vardenafil and sildenafil, to the retina rod phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6). The results demonstrate differential off-target reactivity with PDE6 and an interaction preference for lipidated proteoforms of G proteins. In summary, this study highlights the opportunities for probing proteoform–ligand interactions within natural membrane environments. G protein-coupled receptors and their effectors can now be released directly from a lipid bilayer using infrared irradiation for proteoform-level characterization by native top-down mass spectrometry. This represents a critical development for drug discovery, as the direct role of post-translational modifications in protein–protein and protein–drug interactions can be characterized.},

  abstract     = {Oxide–water interfaces host a wide range of important reactions in nature and modern industrial applications; however, accurate knowledge about these interfaces is still lacking at the molecular level owing to difficulties in accessing buried oxide surfaces. Here we report an experimental scheme enabling in situ sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy of oxide surfaces in liquid water. Application to the silica–water interface revealed the emergence of unexpected surface reaction pathways with water. With ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations, we uncovered a surface reconstruction, triggered by deprotonation of surface hydroxylated groups, that led to unconventional five-coordinated silicon species. The results help demystify the multimodal chemistry of aqueous silica discovered decades ago, bringing in fresh information that modifies the current understanding. Our study will provide new opportunities for future in-depth physical and chemical characterizations of other oxide–water interfaces. Water–oxide interfaces are ubiquitous in nature, yet a molecular-level understanding of these complex environments is still lacking. Now, using in situ nonlinear optical spectroscopy, unconventional reaction pathways have been revealed during the structural evolution of a silicon oxide surface in liquid water, resolving long-standing controversies and providing new microscopic insights.},

  abstract     = {Hard ticks feed on their host for multiple days. To ensure firm attachment, they secrete a protein-rich saliva that eventually forms a solid cement cone. The underlying mechanism of this liquid-to-solid transition is currently not understood. This study focuses on the phase transitions of a disordered glycine-rich protein (GRP) found in tick saliva. We show that GRP undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation via simple coacervation to form biomolecular condensates in salty environments. Cation–π and π–π interactions mediated by periodically placed arginine and aromatic amino-acid residues are the primary driving forces that promote phase separation. Interestingly, GRP condensates exhibit ageing by undergoing liquid-to-gel transition over time and exhibit adhesive properties, similar to the naturally occurring cement cone. Finally, we provide evidence for protein-rich condensates in natural tick saliva. Our findings provide a starting point to gain further insights into the bioadhesion of ticks, to develop novel tick control strategies, and towards achieving biomedical applications such as tissue sealants. Ticks adhere firmly to their host by secreting a protein-rich saliva that eventually forms a solid bioadhesive, but the mechanism underlying this phase transition is not understood. Now it has been shown that a disordered glycine-rich protein present in tick saliva undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation, followed by a liquid-to-gel transition, and exhibits adhesive properties.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of mesoporous metal–organic frameworks (meso-MOFs) is desirable as these materials can be used in various applications. However, owing to the imbalance in structural tension at the micro-scale (MOF crystallization) and the meso-scales (assembly of micelles with MOF subunits), the formation of single-crystal meso-MOFs is challenging. Here we report the preparation of uniform single-crystal meso-MOF nanoparticles with ordered mesopore channels in microporous frameworks with definite arrangements, through a cooperative assembly method co-mediated by strong and weak acids. These nanoparticles feature a truncated octahedron shape with variable size and well-defined two-dimensional hexagonally structured (p6mm) columnar mesopores. Notably, the match between the crystallization kinetics of MOFs and the assembly kinetics of micelles is critical for forming the single-crystal meso-MOFs. On the basis of this strategy, we have constructed a library of meso-MOFs with tunable large pore sizes, controllable mesophases, various morphologies and multivariate components. The imbalance in structural tension between crystalline materials and surfactant micelles makes the synthesis of crystalline mesoporous metal–organic frameworks (meso-MOFs) challenging. Now single-crystalline meso-MOFs featuring ordered mesopores have been prepared through the assembly of surfactant micelles and subunits of crystalline MOFs—a process co-mediated by strong and weak acids.},

The co-crystallization of nanoclusters with functional organic molecules provides opportunities to access an even wider range of structures and properties, but can be challenging to control synthetically. Here we introduce a supramolecular approach to direct the assembly of atomically precise silver nanoclusters into a series of nanocluster‒organic ionic co-crystals with tunable structures and properties. By leveraging non-covalent interactions between anionic silver nanoclusters and cationic organic macrocycles of varying sizes, the orientation of nanocluster surface ligands can be manipulated to achieve in situ resolution of enantiopure nanocluster‒organic ionic co-crystals that feature large chiroptical effects. Beyond chirality, this co-crystal assembly approach provides a promising platform for designing functional solid-state nanomaterials through a combination of supramolecular chemistry and atomically precise nanochemistry. The co-crystallization of nanoclusters with functional organic molecules can provide access to superlattices with unique properties, but this process remains synthetically challenging. Now it has been shown that silver nanoclusters and organic macrocycles can be assembled through a supramolecular approach into ionic co-crystals with tunable structures and large chiroptical effects.},

  abstract     = {Resolving the molecular basis of a Mendelian condition remains challenging owing to the diverse mechanisms by which genetic variants cause disease. To address this, we developed a synchronized long-read genome, methylome, epigenome and transcriptome sequencing approach, which enables accurate single-nucleotide, insertion–deletion and structural variant calling and diploid de novo genome assembly. This permits the simultaneous elucidation of haplotype-resolved CpG methylation, chromatin accessibility and full-length transcript information in a single long-read sequencing run. Application of this approach to an Undiagnosed Diseases Network participant with a chromosome X;13-balanced translocation of uncertain significance revealed that this translocation disrupted the functioning of four separate genes (NBEA, PDK3, MAB21L1 and RB1) previously associated with single-gene Mendelian conditions. Notably, the function of each gene was disrupted via a distinct mechanism that required integration of the four ‘omes’ to resolve. These included fusion transcript formation, enhancer adoption, transcriptional readthrough silencing and inappropriate X-chromosome inactivation of autosomal genes. Overall, this highlights the utility of synchronized long-read multi-omic profiling for mechanistically resolving complex phenotypes. Simultaneous profiling of the genome, methylome, epigenome and transcriptome using single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing and multiplexed arrays isoform sequencing identifies the genetic and molecular basis of an undiagnosed Mendelian disease case with an X;13-balanced translocation.},

However, performing GWASs on millions of samples often leads to trade-offs between computational efficiency and statistical power, reducing the benefits of large-scale data collection efforts. We developed Quickdraws, a method that increases association power in quantitative and binary traits without sacrificing computational efficiency, leveraging a spike-and-slab prior on variant effects, stochastic variational inference and graphics processing unit acceleration. We applied Quickdraws to 79 quantitative and 50 binary traits in 405,088 UK Biobank samples, identifying 4.97% and 3.25% more associations than REGENIE and 22.71% and 7.07% more than FastGWA. Quickdraws had costs comparable to REGENIE, FastGWA and SAIGE on the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform service, while being substantially faster than BOLT-LMM. These results highlight the promise of leveraging machine learning techniques for scalable GWASs without sacrificing power or robustness. Quickdraws is a mixed-model association tool with a noninfinitesimal prior for analyzing binary and quantitative traits, using a scalable variational inference that allows analysis of biobank-scale cohorts.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell genomics technologies have accelerated our understanding of cell-state heterogeneity in diverse contexts. Although single-cell RNA sequencing identifies rare populations that express specific marker transcript combinations, traditional flow sorting requires cell surface markers with high-fidelity antibodies, limiting our ability to interrogate these populations. In addition, many single-cell studies require the isolation of nuclei from tissue, eliminating the ability to enrich learned rare cell states based on extranuclear protein markers. In the present report, we addressed these limitations by developing Programmable Enrichment via RNA FlowFISH by sequencing (PERFF-seq), a scalable assay that enables scRNA-seq profiling of subpopulations defined by the abundance of specific RNA transcripts. Across immune populations (n = 184,126 cells) and fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain tissue (n = 33,145 nuclei), we demonstrated that programmable sorting logic via RNA-based cytometry can isolate rare cell populations and uncover phenotypic heterogeneity via downstream, high-throughput, single-cell genomics analyses.

  abstract     = {A pan-transcriptome describes the transcriptional and post-transcriptional consequences of genome diversity from multiple individuals within a species. We developed a barley pan-transcriptome using 20 inbred genotypes representing domesticated barley diversity by generating and analyzing short- and long-read RNA-sequencing datasets from multiple tissues. To overcome single reference bias in transcript quantification, we constructed genotype-specific reference transcript datasets (RTDs) and integrated these into a linear pan-genome framework to create a pan-RTD, allowing transcript categorization as core, shell or cloud. Focusing on the core (expressed in all genotypes), we observed significant transcript abundance variation among tissues and between genotypes driven partly by RNA processing, gene copy number, structural rearrangements and conservation of promotor motifs. Network analyses revealed conserved co-expression module::tissue correlations and frequent functional diversification. To complement the pan-transcriptome, we constructed a comprehensive cultivar (cv.) Morex gene-expression atlas and illustrate how these combined datasets can be used to guide biological inquiry. A long- and short-read barley pan-transcriptome assembled from 20 diverse barley genotypes offers insights into genotype- and tissue-dependent gene expression and function.},

  abstract     = {Rice production is facing substantial threats from global warming associated with extreme temperatures. Here we report that modifying a heat stress-induced negative regulator, a negative regulator of thermotolerance 1 (NAT1), increases wax deposition and enhances thermotolerance in rice. We demonstrated that the C2H2 family transcription factor NAT1 directly inhibits bHLH110 expression, and bHLH110 directly promotes the expression of wax biosynthetic genes CER1/CER1L under heat stress conditions. In situ hybridization revealed that both NAT1 and bHLH110 are predominantly expressed in epidermal layers. By using gene-editing technology, we successfully mutated NAT1 to eliminate its inhibitory effects on wax biosynthesis and improved thermotolerance without yield penalty under normal temperature conditions. Field trials further confirmed the potential of NAT1-edited rice to increase seed-setting rate and grain yield. Therefore, our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanisms governing wax biosynthesis under heat stress conditions in rice and provide a strategy to enhance heat resilience through the modification of NAT1. Negative regulator of thermotolerance 1 (NAT1) is identified as a negative regulator of thermotolerance in rice through the NAT1–bHLH110–CER1/CER1L module. Modifying NAT1 by targeted gene editing increases wax deposition and enhances thermotolerance in rice.},

  abstract     = {Human adipose depots are functionally distinct. Yet, recent single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analyses largely uncovered overlapping or similar cell-type landscapes. We hypothesized that adipocyte subtypes, differentiation trajectories and/or intercellular communication patterns could illuminate this depot similarity–difference gap. For this, we performed snRNA-seq of human subcutaneous or visceral adipose tissues (five or ten samples, respectively). Of 27,665 adipocyte nuclei in both depots, most were ‘classical’, namely enriched in lipid metabolism pathways. However, we also observed ‘nonclassical’ adipocyte subtypes, enriched in immune-related, extracellular matrix deposition (fibrosis), vascularization or angiogenesis or ribosomal and mitochondrial processes. Pseudo-temporal analysis showed a developmental trajectory from adipose progenitor cells to classical adipocytes via nonclassical adipocytes, suggesting that the classical state stems from loss, rather than gain, of specialized functions. Last, intercellular communication routes were consistent with the different inflammatory tone of the two depots. Jointly, these findings provide a high-resolution view into the contribution of cellular composition, differentiation and intercellular communication patterns to human fat depot differences. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues is used to identify adipocyte subpopulations and explore their developmental trajectories and interactions.},

  abstract     = {Targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs) is crucial for effective cancer treatment, yet resistance mechanisms to LGR5+ CSC depletion in WNT-driven colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In the present study, we revealed that mutant intestinal stem cells (SCs) depart from their canonical identity, traversing a dynamic phenotypic spectrum. This enhanced plasticity is initiated by oncofetal (OnF) reprogramming, driven by YAP and AP-1, with subsequent AP-1 hyperactivation promoting lineage infidelity. The retinoid X receptor serves as a gatekeeper of OnF reprogramming and its deregulation after adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) loss of function establishes an OnF ‘memory’ sustained by YAP and AP-1. Notably, the clinical significance of OnF and LGR5+ states in isolation is constrained by their functional redundancy. Although the canonical LGR5+ state is sensitive to the FOLFIRI regimen, an active OnF program correlates with resistance, supporting its role in driving drug-tolerant states. Targeting this program in combination with the current standard of care is pivotal for achieving effective and durable CRC treatment. Oncofetal (OnF) reprogramming, driven by YAP and AP-1, induces phenotypic plasticity and therapy resistance in WNT-dependent colorectal cancer (CRC). Targeting the OnF state in combination with chemotherapy substantially attenuates tumor growth in mouse models and patient-derived CRC tumoroids.},

  abstract     = {Segmental duplications (SDs) contribute significantly to human disease, evolution and diversity but have been difficult to resolve at the sequence level. We present a population genetics survey of SDs by analyzing 170 human genome assemblies (from 85 samples representing 38 Africans and 47 non-Africans) in which the majority of autosomal SDs are fully resolved using long-read sequence assembly. Excluding the acrocentric short arms and sex chromosomes, we identify 173.2 Mb of duplicated sequence (47.4 Mb not present in the telomere-to-telomere reference) distinguishing fixed from structurally polymorphic events. We find that intrachromosomal SDs are among the most variable, with rare events mapping near their progenitor sequences. African genomes harbor significantly more intrachromosomal SDs and are more likely to have recently duplicated gene families with higher copy numbers than non-African samples. Comparison to a resource of 563 million full-length isoform sequencing reads identifies 201 novel, potentially protein-coding genes corresponding to these copy number polymorphic SDs. Analysis of 170 human genomes assembled using long-read sequencing provides a map of structural variation within regions of segmental duplication and identifies novel candidate protein-coding genes supported by full-length Iso-Seq reads.},

We developed a statistical pipeline to infer fine-scale Ancestry Components and applied it to UK Biobank data. Ancestry Components identify population structure not captured by widely used principal components, improving stratification correction for geographically correlated traits. To estimate the similarity of genetic effect sizes between groups, we developed ANCHOR, which estimates changes in the predictive power of an existing PGS in distinct local ancestry segments. ANCHOR infers highly similar (estimated correlation 0.98 ± 0.07) effect sizes between UK Biobank participants of African and European ancestry for 47 of 53 quantitative phenotypes, suggesting that gene–environment and gene–gene interactions do not play major roles in poor cross-ancestry PGS transferability for these traits in the United Kingdom, and providing optimism that shared causal mutations operate similarly in different populations. This study introduces the concept of Ancestry Components and shows that they can offer improved population stratification correction for geographically correlated traits. By using ancestry-aware polygenic score construction in admixed individuals, the authors find that effect sizes are conserved across ancestry groups.},

We identified ~2.2 million TR molecular quantitative trait loci (TR-xQTLs), linking ~139,000 unique TRs to nearby molecular phenotypes, including many known disease-risk TRs, such as the G2C4 expansion in C9orf72 associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Fine-mapping revealed ~18,700 TRs as potential causal variants. Our in vitro experiments further confirmed the causal and independent regulatory effects of three TRs. Additional colocalization analysis indicated the potential causal role of TR variation in brain-related phenotypes, highlighted by a 3ʹ-UTR TR in NUDT14 linked to cortical surface area and a TG repeat in PLEKHA1, associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Mapping of multi-omic molecular quantitative trait loci associated with tandem repeat size variation in up to 4,412 human brain samples from 1,597 donors offers insights into how these variants affect gene regulation and mediate disease risk.},

Given that obesity strongly influences circulating protein levels, we investigated proteins mediating the effects of obesity on coronary artery disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. By integrating two-step proteome-wide Mendelian randomization, colocalization, epigenomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified five mediators and prioritized collagen type VI α3 (COL6A3). COL6A3 levels were strongly increased by body mass index and increased coronary artery disease risk. Notably, the carboxyl terminus product of COL6A3, endotrophin, drove this effect. COL6A3 was highly expressed in disease-relevant cell types and tissues. Finally, we found that body fat reduction could reduce plasma levels of COL6A3-derived endotrophin, indicating a tractable way to modify endotrophin levels. In summary, we provide actionable insights into how circulating proteins mediate the effects of obesity on cardiometabolic diseases and prioritize endotrophin as a potential therapeutic target. Two-step Mendelian randomization, combined with multiple layers of omics evidence, implicates COL6A3-derived endotrophin as a mediator of coronary artery disease risk in the context of obesity.},

We identified 318 independent genome-wide significant (P ≤ 5 × 10−8) variants, 184 of which were novel. Most demonstrated evidence of replication in an independent cohort (n = 95,768). Meta-analyzing discovery and replication (n = 392,522) identified 447 variants, of which a further 111 were novel. Out-of-sample variance in PSA explained by our genome-wide polygenic risk scores ranged from 11.6% to 16.6% for European ancestry, 5.5% to 9.5% for African ancestry, 13.5% to 18.2% for Hispanic/Latino and 8.6% to 15.3% for Asian ancestry and decreased with increasing age. Midlife genetically adjusted PSA levels were more strongly associated with overall and aggressive prostate cancer than unadjusted PSA levels. Our study highlights how including proportionally more participants from underrepresented populations improves genetic prediction of PSA levels, offering potential to personalize prostate cancer screening.

  abstract     = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) yield large numbers of genetic loci associated with traits and diseases. Predicting the effector genes that mediate these locus-trait associations remains challenging. Here we present the FLAMES (fine-mapped locus assessment model of effector genes) framework, which predicts the most likely effector gene in a locus. FLAMES creates machine learning predictions from biological data linking single-nucleotide polymorphisms to genes, and then evaluates these scores together with gene-centric evidence of convergence of the GWAS signal in functional networks. We benchmark FLAMES on gene-locus pairs derived by expert curation, rare variant implication and domain knowledge of molecular traits. We demonstrate that combining single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based and convergence-based modalities outperforms prioritization strategies using a single line of evidence. Applying FLAMES, we resolve the FSHB locus in the GWAS for dizygotic twinning and further leverage this framework to find schizophrenia risk genes that converge with rare coding evidence and are relevant in different stages of life. FLAMES is a machine learning approach combining variant fine-mapping, SNP-to-gene annotations and convergence-based gene prioritization scores to identify candidate effector genes at genome-wide associated loci with high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Huntington’s disease, one of more than 50 inherited repeat expansion disorders1, is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG expansion in HTT2. Inherited CAG repeat length is the primary determinant of age of onset, with human genetic studies underscoring that the disease is driven by the CAG length-dependent propensity of the repeat to further expand in the brain3–9. Routes to slowing somatic CAG expansion, therefore, hold promise for disease-modifying therapies. Several DNA repair genes, notably in the mismatch repair pathway, modify somatic expansion in Huntington’s disease mouse models10. To identify novel modifiers of somatic expansion, we used CRISPR–Cas9 editing in Huntington’s disease knock-in mice to enable in vivo screening of expansion-modifier candidates at scale. This included testing of Huntington’s disease onset modifier genes emerging from human genome-wide association studies as well as interactions between modifier genes, providing insight into pathways underlying CAG expansion and potential therapeutic targets. A novel in vivo screening strategy identifies new modifiers of somatic CAG repeat expansion that contribute to age of onset in Huntington’s disease.},

Here, with a series of developed lines with or without PFT but all possessing HisR and five HisR-carrying PFT mutant lines created via gene editing, we show that PFT does not confer FHB resistance and that the HisR resistance effect does not require PFT in the tested conditions. We also show that PFT mutations are not associated with morphological and phenological characteristics that often affect FHB severity. Analysis of wheat lines generated through introgression or gene editing provides evidence that Fhb1-mediated resistance to Fusarium head blight is independent of the pore-forming toxin gene PFT.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, our understanding of how new genes originate in diverse organisms has advanced substantially, and more than a dozen molecular mechanisms for generating initial gene structures were identified, in addition to gene duplication. These new genes have been found to integrate into and modify pre-existing gene networks primarily through mutation and selection, revealing new patterns and rules with stable origination rates across various organisms. This progress has challenged the prevailing belief that new proteins evolve from pre-existing genes, as new genes may arise de novo from noncoding DNA sequences in many organisms, with high rates observed in flowering plants. New genes have important roles in phenotypic and functional evolution across diverse biological processes and structures, with detectable fitness effects of sexual conflict genes that can shape species divergence. Such knowledge of new genes can be of translational value in agriculture and medicine. This Review discusses the various molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of new genes and highlights their important functions and phenotypes with an emphasis on the evolutionary forces underlying natural selection and sexual conflict.},

In this Perspective, we identify definitions of broad that have been used interchangeably, despite their distinct implications. We further offer a framework with clarified concepts for genomic data sharing and probe six examples in genomics that produced public data. Finally, we articulate three challenges. First, we explore the need to reinterpret the limits of general research use data. Second, we consider the governance of public data deposition from extant samples. Third, we ask whether, in light of changing concepts of broad, participants should be encouraged to share their status as participants publicly or not. Each of these challenges is followed with recommendations. This Perspective discusses the definitions of ‘broad’ that have been used in the context of sharing of human genomic data and proposes a clarified and reformed terminology for describing genomic data sharing more precisely.},

These behaviours, occurring over hours to days, influence long-term cell fates including differentiation. Here we report a whole-cell movement that occurs in sliding hydrogels at the minutes timescale, termed cell tumbling, characterized by three-dimensional cell dynamics and hydrogel deformation elicited by heightened seconds-to-minutes-scale cytoskeletal and nuclear activity. Studies inhibiting or promoting the cell tumbling of mesenchymal stem cells show that this behaviour enhances differentiation into chondrocytes. Further, it is associated with a decrease in global chromatin accessibility, which is required for enhanced differentiation. Cell tumbling also occurs during differentiation into other lineages and its differentiation-enhancing effects are validated in various hydrogel platforms. Our results establish that cell tumbling is an additional regulator of stem cell differentiation, mediated by rapid niche deformation and nuclear mechanotransduction. Minutes-scale whole-cell movements fuelled by fast cytoskeletal dynamics and nuclear activity regulate mesenchymal stem cells differentiation into chondrocytes in hydrogels, being another process modulating the stem cell fate.},

Patients with B cell lymphoma on effective immunotherapies exhibit diminished antibody production, leading to higher infection rates and reduced vaccine efficacy, even after B cell recovery. Current ex vivo models fail to sustain long-term GC reactions and effectively test B cell responses. Here we developed synthetic hydrogels mimicking the lymphoid tissue microenvironment, enabling human GCs from tonsils and peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived B cells. Immune organoids derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells maintain GC B cells and plasma cells longer than tonsil-derived ones and exhibit unique B cell programming, including GC compartments, somatic hypermutation, immunoglobulin class switching and B cell clones. Chemical inhibition of transcriptional and epigenetic processes enhances plasma cell formation. While integrating polarized CXCL12 protein in a lymphoid organ-on-chip modulates GC responses in healthy donor B cells, it fails with B cells derived from patients with lymphoma. Our system allows rapid, controlled modelling of immune responses and B cell disorders.

  abstract     = {A successful therapeutic outcome in the treatment of solid tumours requires efficient intratumoural drug accumulation and retention. Here we demonstrate that zinc gluconate in oral supplements assembles with plasma proteins to form ZnO nanoparticles that selectively accumulate into papillary Caki-2 renal tumours and promote the recruitment of dendritic cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to tumour tissues. Renal tumour targeting is mediated by the preferential binding of zinc ions to metallothionein-1X proteins, which are constitutively overexpressed in Caki-2 renal tumour cells. This binding event further upregulates intracellular metallothionein-1X expression to induce additional nanoparticle binding and retention. In both tumour animal models and human renal tumour samples, we show that ZnO nanoparticles actively cross the vascular wall to achieve high intratumoural accumulation. We further explore this feature of ZnO nanoparticles for the delivery of chemotherapeutics to mouse and rabbit cancer models. Our findings demonstrate that ZnO nanoparticles derived from supplements can serve as a multifunctional drug delivery and cancer immunotherapy platform. Zinc gluconate in oral supplements associates with plasma proteins to form renal-tumour-accumulating ZnO nanoparticles, which have antitumoural immune activity and can also be used for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents.},

However, their shapes are often transient and hard to reprogramme. Here we construct a synthetic cell model composed of signal-responsive DNA nanorafts, biogenic pores and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We demonstrate that reshaping of DNA rafts at the nanoscale can be coupled to reshaping of GUVs at the microscale. The nanorafts collectively undergo reversible transitions between isotropic and short-range local order on the lipid membrane, programmably remodelling the GUV shape. Assisted by the biogenic pores, during GUV shape recovery the locally ordered DNA rafts perforate the membrane, forming sealable synthetic channels for large cargo transport. Our work outlines a versatile platform for interfacing reconfigurable DNA nanostructures with synthetic cells, expanding the potential of DNA nanotechnology in synthetic biology. The shape of biological matter is central to their function and interaction with other cellular components. A combination of DNA origami nanorafts with biogenic pores reversibly controls the shape and permeability of lipid vesicles at the microscale.},

Here we conduct numerical investigations into the structure–dynamics relationship in model glass-forming liquids, with a specific focus on an elementary particle rearrangement mode known as the ‘T1 process’. We discover that the ability of a T1 process to preserve glassy structural order before and after is pivotal towards determining a liquid’s fragility—whether it exhibits super-Arrhenius-like or Arrhenius-like behaviour. If a T1 process disrupts local structural order, it must occur independently without cooperativity, resulting in Arrhenius-like behaviour. By contrast, if it can maintain order, it sequentially propagates from disordered peripheries to the middle of high-structural-order regions, leading to cooperativity and super-Arrhenius-like behaviour. Our study establishes a microscopic link between liquid-structure ordering, dynamic cooperativity and super-Arrhenius-like dynamics, extending the understanding of the structure–dynamics relationships in supercooled liquids. An elementary particle rearrangement mode known as the T1 process links liquid dynamics and local structural ordering to understand the physical mechanisms of super-Arrhenius-like behaviour in glass-forming liquids.},

Here we introduce hybrid radical pairs constructed from semiconductor quantum dots and organic molecules. The large g-factor difference enables us to directly observe the radical-pair spin quantum beats usually hidden in previous studies, which are further accelerated by the strong exchange coupling of radical pairs enabled by the quantum confinement of quantum dots. The rapid quantum beats enable the efficient and coherent control of charge recombination dynamics at room temperature, with the modulation level of the yield of spin-triplet products reaching 400%.

However, the substantial open-circuit voltage loss in the wide-bandgap perovskite subcell hinders further improvements in power-conversion efficiency. Here we develop wide-bandgap perovskite films with improved (100) crystal orientation that suppress non-radiative recombination. We show that using two-dimensional perovskite as an intermediate phase on the film surface promotes heterogeneous nucleation along the (100) three-dimensional perovskite facets during crystallization. Preferred (100) orientations can be realized by augmenting the quantity of two-dimensional phases through surface composition engineering, without the need for excessive two-dimensional ligands that otherwise impede carrier transport. We demonstrate an open-circuit voltage of 1.373 V for 1.78 eV wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, along with a high fill factor of 84.7%. This yields an open-circuit voltage of 2.21 V and a certified power-conversion efficiency of 29.1% for all-perovskite tandem solar cells, measured under the maximum power-point conditions. Substantial open-circuit voltage loss and inherent non-radiative recombination hinder efficiency improvements in wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells. Here the authors augment two-dimensional perovskite phases on the surface to promote (100) facet growth on three-dimensional perovskite facets, improving the open-circuit voltage and efficiency of the resulting wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) hold great promise for next-generation safe, durable and energy-dense battery technology. However, solid-state sulfur conversion reactions are kinetically sluggish and primarily constrained to the restricted three-phase boundary area of sulfur, carbon and solid electrolytes, making it challenging to achieve high sulfur utilization. Here we develop and implement mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIECs) in sulfur cathodes to replace conventional solid electrolytes and invoke conversion reactions at sulfur–MIEC interfaces in addition to traditional three-phase boundaries. Microscopic and tomographic analyses reveal the emergence of mixed-conducting domains embedded in sulfur at sulfur–MIEC boundaries, helping promote the thorough conversion of active sulfur into Li2S. Consequently, substantially improved active sulfur ratios (up to 87.3%) and conversion degrees (&amp;gt;94%) are achieved in Li–S ASSBs with high discharge capacity (&amp;gt;1,450 mAh g–1) and long cycle life (&amp;gt;1,000 cycles). The strategy is also applied to enhance the active material utilization of other conversion cathodes. Low-cost conversion cathodes are promising for future all-solid-state battery technology, but their poor electronic and ionic conductivity restrict reactions to three-phase boundaries. By using mixed ionic–electronic conductors, conversion reactions can be initiated at two-phase boundaries, resulting in enhanced discharge capacity and lifespan.},

Typically, chemically prepared c-Na2V2(PO4)3, obtained by annealing an equimolar mixture of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3, exhibits a specific sodium-ion distribution (occupancy of the Na(1) site of only 0.66(4)), whereas that of the electrochemically obtained e-Na2V2(PO4)3 (from Na3V2(PO4)3) is close to 1. Unlike conventional Na3V2(PO4)3, when used as positive electrode materials in Na-ion batteries, the NaxV2(PO4)3 compositions lead to unusual single-phase Na+ extraction/insertion mechanisms with continuous voltage changes upon Na+ extraction/insertion. We demonstrate that the average equilibrium operating voltage observed upon Na+ deintercalation from single-phase Na2V2(PO4)3 is increased up to an average value of ~3.70 V versus Na+/Na (thanks to the activation of the V4+/V5+ redox couple) compared to 3.37 V versus Na+/Na in conventional Na3V2(PO4)3, thus leading to an increase in the theoretical energy density from 396.3 Wh kg–1 to 458.1 Wh kg–1. Electrochemical and chemical Na+ deintercalation from c-Na2V2(PO4)3 enables complete Na-ion extraction, increasing energy density. Single-phase NaxV2(PO4)3 compositions obtained by annealing mixtures of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 enable the complete electrochemical extraction of Na+ through the activation of the V4+/V5+ couple.

In van der Waals antiferromagnets, a new type of magnetic polymorphism arises, presenting multiple layer-selective magnetic structures with identical total magnetization. However, resolving and manipulating such magnetic polymorphs remain challenging. Here, phase-resolved magnetic second harmonic generation microscopy is used to elucidate magnetic polymorphism in 2D layered antiferromagnet CrSBr, demonstrating deterministic and layer-selective switching of magnetic polymorphs. Using a nonlinear magneto-optical technique, we unambiguously resolve the polymorphic spin-flip transitions in CrSBr bilayers and tetralayers through both the amplitude and phase of light. Remarkably, the deterministic routing of polymorphic spin-flip transitions originates from a ‘layer-sharing’ effect, where the transitions are governed by laterally extended layers acting as ‘control bits’. We envision that such controllable magnetic polymorphism could be ubiquitous for van der Waals layered antiferromagnets, enabling new designs and constructions of spintronic and opto-spintronic devices for probabilistic computation and neuromorphic engineering.

Here we demonstrate that a multicycle terahertz magnetic-field pulse can be used to induce non-thermal spin switching in antiferromagnets. When a strong pulse is applied to Sm0.7Er0.3FeO3, the magnetic order parameter is first driven away from the barrier between the two potential minima of this antiferromagnet and then, in the subsequent inertial motion towards the opposite direction, it crosses the barrier. Our analysis reveals that the initial motion is driven by a dynamical modification of the magnetic potential, and this modification is enhanced through coupling between the two magnon modes.

Recent advances in the study of chiral systems have stimulated interest in the discovery of symmetry-breaking states that enable exotic phenomena such as spontaneous gyrotropic order and superconductivity. Here we examine the interaction between light chirality and electron spins in indium selenide and study the effect of magnetic field on emerging tunnelling photocurrents at the Van Hove singularity. Although the effect is symmetric under linearly polarized light excitation, a non-symmetric signal emerges when the excitation is circularly polarized, making it possible to electrically detect light’s chirality. Our study shows a negligible out-of-plane g-factor for few-layer indium selenide at the valence band edge, resulting in an unbalanced Zeeman splitting in hexagonal boron nitride spin bands. This finding allows us to measure the change in energy barrier height with exceptional resolution (~15 μeV). Furthermore, we confirm the long-standing theoretical prediction of spin-polarized hole accumulation in the flat valence band at increasing laser powers. Light chirality and electron spin interactions and the dependence of tunnelling photocurrent on the magnetic field are studied in indium selenide, exploiting its non-symmetric response to circularly polarized light to electrically detect chirality.},

In such interfaces, soft materials bring many advantages based on their flexibility, compliance and large stimulus-driven responses. Here, we create electrochemically mutable, soft metasurfaces that capitalize on the swelling of soft conducting polymers to alter the shape and associated resonant response of metasurface elements. Such geometric tuning overcomes the typical trade-off between achieving substantial tuning and low optical loss that is intrinsic to dynamic metasurfaces relying on index tuning of materials. Using the commercial polymer PEDOT:PSS, we demonstrate dynamic, high-resolution colour tuning and high-diffraction-efficiency (&amp;gt;19%) beam-steering devices that operate at CMOS-compatible voltages (~1.5 V). These results highlight how the deformability of soft materials can enable a class of high-performance metasurfaces that are suitable for body-worn technologies. Electrochemically mutable soft metasurfaces based on soft conducting polymers exploit the deformability of soft materials through swelling to dynamically tune the shape and associated resonant response of the metasurface devices.},

  abstract     = {The downscaling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology has produced breakthroughs in electronics, but more extreme scaling has hit a wall of device performance degradation. One key challenge is the development of insulators with high dielectric constant, wide bandgap and high tunnel masses. Here, we show that two-dimensional monocrystalline gadolinium pentoxide, which is devised through combining particle swarm optimization algorithm and theoretical calculations and synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy, could exhibit a high dielectric constant of ~25.5 and a wide bandgap simultaneously. A desirable equivalent oxide thickness down to 1 nm with an ultralow leakage current of ~10−4 A cm−2 even at 5 MV cm−1 is achieved. The molybdenum disulfide transistors gated by gadolinium pentoxide exhibit high on/off ratios over 108 and near-Boltzmann-limit subthreshold swing at an operation voltage of 0.5 V. We also constructed inverter circuits with high gain and nanowatt power consumption. This reliable approach to integrating ultrathin monocrystalline insulators paves the way to future nanoelectronics. Two-dimensional monocrystalline gadolinium pentoxide with high dielectric constant and wide bandgap was prepared through van der Waals epitaxy, allowing the realization of sub-1 nm equivalent oxide thickness and low-power nanoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Batch production of single-crystal two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides is one prerequisite for the fabrication of next-generation integrated circuits. Contemporary strategies for the wafer-scale high-quality crystallinity of 2D materials centre on merging unidirectionally aligned, differently sized domains. However, an imperfectly merged area with a translational lattice brings about a high defect density and low device uniformity, which restricts the application of the 2D materials. Here we establish a liquid-to-solid crystallization in 2D space that can rapidly grow a centimetre-scale single-crystal MoS2 domain with no grain boundaries. The large MoS2 single crystal obtained shows superb uniformity and high quality with an ultra-low defect density. A statistical analysis of field effect transistors fabricated from the MoS2 reveals a high device yield and minimal variation in mobility, positioning this FET as an advanced standard monolayer MoS2 device. This 2D Czochralski method has implications for fabricating high-quality and scalable 2D semiconductor materials and devices. A 2D Czochralski method is introduced for rapidly growing centimetre-scale single-crystal MoS2 domains with low defect density and impressive electrical performance. This method shows potential for fabricating high-quality and scalable 2D semiconductor materials and devices.},

  abstract     = {Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22 mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks. Resetting qubits in a quantum computer requires significant hardware resources. Now, an experiment demonstrates an on-chip quantum refrigerator that uses a thermal gradient to reset a superconducting qubit more effectively than conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics and play an important role in condensed-matter physics. The constituents of gauge theories, for example, charged matter and electric gauge field, are governed by local gauge constraints, which lead to key phenomena such as the confinement of particles that are not fully understood. In this context, quantum simulators may address questions that are challenging for classical methods. Although engineering gauge constraints is highly demanding, recent advances in quantum computing are beginning to enable digital quantum simulations of gauge theories. Here we simulate confinement dynamics in a $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ lattice gauge theory on a superconducting quantum processor. Tuning a term that couples only to the electric field produces confinement of charges, a manifestation of the tight bond that the gauge constraint generates between both. Moreover, we show how a modification of the gauge constraint from $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ towards U(1) symmetry freezes the system dynamics. Our work illustrates the restriction that the underlying gauge constraint imposes on the dynamics of a lattice gauge theory, showcases how gauge constraints can be modified and protected, and promotes the study of other models governed by multibody interactions. Gauge theories host important phenomena such as confinement that are difficult to study theoretically. Advances in quantum computers have now made it possible to perform digital quantum simulations of confinement dynamics in a gauge theory.},

  abstract     = {Understanding thermodynamical measurement noise is of central importance for electrical and optical precision measurements. These range from semiconductor sensors, in which the Brownian motion of charge carriers poses limits, to optical reference cavities for atomic clocks or gravitational wave detection, which are limited by thermo-refractive and thermo-elastic noise. Here we find that charge-carrier density fluctuations give rise to a noise process in electro-optic photonic integrated circuits. We show that the noise exhibited by lithium niobate and lithium tantalate photonic integrated microresonators feature a frequency scaling to the power of −1.2, deviating from thermo-refractive noise theory. This noise is consistent with thermodynamical charge noise, which leads to electrical field fluctuations that are transduced via the strong Pockels effects of electro-optic materials. Our results establish electrical Johnson–Nyquist noise as the fundamental limitation for electro-optic integrated photonics, crucial for determining performance limits for both classical and quantum devices. Thermal agitation of charge carriers, known as Johnson noise, is the dominant noise in electronic circuits. Now it has also been observed as a key noise source in integrated electro-optic photonic circuits, posing challenges for future applications.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction is essential for mitigating hardware errors in quantum computers by encoding logical information into several physical qubits. However, no single error-correcting code intrinsically supports a fault-tolerant implementation of all the gates needed for universal quantum computing. One approach for addressing this problem is to switch between two suitable error-correcting codes that in combination provide a fault-tolerant universal gate set. Here we present the experimental implementation of fault-tolerant code switching between two different codes in a trapped-ion processor. We switch between the 7-qubit colour code, which features fault-tolerant CNOT and H quantum gates, and the 10-qubit code, which allows for a fault-tolerant T gate implementation. Together, these codes form a complementary universal gate set. We construct logical circuits and prepare 12 different logical states that are not accessible natively in a fault-tolerant way within a single code. Finally, we use code switching to entangle two logical qubits using the full universal gate set in a single logical quantum circuit. Our results experimentally demonstrate a route towards deterministic control over logical qubits with low auxiliary qubit overhead and without relying on the probabilistic preparation of resource states. Quantum error correction is essential for reliable quantum computing, but no single code supports all required fault-tolerant gates. The demonstration of switching between two codes now enables universal quantum computation with reduced overhead.},

  abstract     = {Simulations of quantum chemistry and quantum materials are believed to be among the most important applications of quantum information processors. However, realizing practical quantum advantage for such problems is challenging because of the prohibitive computational cost of programming typical problems into quantum hardware. Here we introduce a simulation framework for strongly correlated quantum systems represented by model spin Hamiltonians that uses reconfigurable qubit architectures to simulate real-time dynamics in a programmable way. Our approach also introduces an algorithm for extracting chemically relevant spectral properties via classical co-processing of quantum measurement results. We develop a digital–analogue simulation toolbox for efficient Hamiltonian time evolution using digital Floquet engineering and hardware-optimized multi-qubit operations to accurately realize complex spin–spin interactions. As an example, we propose an implementation based on Rydberg atom arrays. In addition, we show how detailed spectral information can be extracted from the dynamics through snapshot measurements and single-ancilla control, enabling the evaluation of excitation energies and finite-temperature susceptibilities from a single dataset. To illustrate the approach, we show how to use the method to compute key properties of a polynuclear transition-metal catalyst and two-dimensional magnetic materials. Quantum simulations of chemistry and materials are challenging due to the complexity of correlated systems. A framework based on reconfigurable qubit architectures and digital–analogue simulations provides a hardware-efficient path forwards.},

  abstract     = {Malignancies of epithelial tissues, called carcinomas, account for most cancer cases. Research has largely focused on correlating different carcinoma subtypes to genetic alterations. However, as well as a rewiring in the signalling networks, carcinoma progression is accompanied by mechanical changes in the epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix. Here we reveal intricate morphologies in the basement membrane at the onset of bladder cancer and propose that they emerge from a mechanical instability upon epithelial overgrowth. We imaged mouse and human bladder tissue and performed differential growth simulations, and found that stiffness changes in the different mucosa layers can result in aberrant tissue morphologies. The resulting thickening, wrinkles and folds resemble early papillary tumours and carcinomas in situ. Atomic force microscopy confirmed local stiffness changes in the pathological basement membrane. Our findings suggest a possible mechanical origin of the different bladder carcinoma subtypes and may guide future developments in treatment and prophylaxis. Carcinoma subtypes are normally linked to specific genetic alterations, but tissue mechanical changes also play a role. Now, aberrant morphologies resembling bladder carcinoma are shown to emerge from stiffness changes during epithelial overgrowth.},

However, the mechanical signatures that influence the fate of extruding cells remain unknown. Here we show that modified force transmission across adherens junctions inhibits apoptotic cell eliminations. By combining cell experiments with varying levels of E-cadherin junctions and three-dimensional modelling of cell monolayers, we find that these changes not only affect the fate of the extruded cells but also shift extrusion from the apical to the basal side, leading to cell invasion into soft collagen gels. We generalize our findings using xenografts and cysts cultured in matrigel, derived from patients with breast cancer. Our results link intercellular force transmission regulated by cell–cell communication to cell extrusion mechanisms, with potential implications during morphogenesis and invasion of cancer cells. Tissues eliminate unwanted cells through cell extrusion, but the factors determining whether these extuded cells live or die are not fully understood. Now force transmission across adherens junctions is shown to have a role in shaping their fate.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanical properties of soft jammed solids that consist of densely packed particles, such as foams and emulsions, requires insights into the microscopic origins of linear viscoelasticity—how a solid responds to an infinitesimal deformation. Here we perform microrheology experiments on concentrated emulsions and measure the storage and loss moduli for a wide range of frequencies. We applied a linear response formalism for microrheology to a soft sphere model that undergoes the jamming transition. We find that the theory quantitatively explains the experiments. Our analysis reveals that the anomalous viscous loss seen in emulsions results from the boson peak, which is a universal vibrational property of amorphous solids and reflects the marginal stability in soft jammed solids. We show that the anomalous viscous loss is universal in systems with various interparticle interactions as it stems from the universal boson peak; it even survives below the jamming density at which thermal fluctuation is pronounced and the dynamics becomes inherently nonlinear. The viscoelastic response of emulsions shows an anomalous loss. This effect is now shown to be related to the boson peak, a universal vibrational feature of amorphous solids.},

The yielded region of the phase diagram correlates with tissue fluidization, whereas the annealing region explains age-related maturation and stiffening. This suggests that some mechanical changes observed in ageing tissues can partially stem from processes analogous to enhanced ageing observed in active glasses. In addition to showing similar yielding diagrams, we strengthen the correspondence to oscillatory shear by demonstrating diverging time scales to steady states, the possibility of memory encoding and reading, and the importance of stress reversals in the annealing process in both cases. Finally, we study yielding in active solids and demonstrate that given the correct geometry, one can either suppress or promote brittle failure via shear band formation by tuning activity. Active glasses are dense, disordered structures made up of motile constituents.

This effect can be realized in two-dimensional moiré systems hosting flat electronic bands but is not usually seen in inversion-symmetric materials. Here, we show that this physics is manifested in helical trilayer graphene—three graphene layers, each twisted in sequence by the same angle—although the system retains global in-plane inversion symmetry. We uncover a phase diagram of correlated and magnetic states at a magic twist angle of 1.8∘, which is explained by a lattice relaxation that leads to the formation of large periodic domains where in-plane inversion symmetry is broken on the moiré scale. Each domain harbours flat topological bands with opposite Chern numbers in the two valleys. We find correlated states at multiple integer and fractional electron fillings per moiré unit cell and an AHE at a subset of them. The AHE disappears above a critical electric displacement field at one electron per unit cell, indicating a topological phase transition. We establish helical trilayer graphene as a platform that presents an opportunity to engineer topology due to its emergent moiré-scale symmetries. Trilayer graphene with the layers consecutively twisted by the same angle is shown to be a platform in which correlated and topological states exist, driven by local lattice relaxations.},

Helical excitations on quantized vortices, referred to as Kelvin waves, are one example of such a physical system. Kelvin waves play a vital role in energy dissipation within inviscid quantum fluids. However, deliberately exciting Kelvin waves has proven to be challenging. Here we introduce a controlled method for exciting Kelvin waves on a quantized vortex in superfluid helium-4. We used a charged nanoparticle that oscillates when driven by a time-varying electric field to stimulate Kelvin waves on the vortex. Confirmation of the helical nature of Kelvin waves was achieved through three-dimensional image reconstruction, which provided visual evidence of their complex dynamics. Additionally, we determined the dispersion relation and the phase velocity of the Kelvin wave and identified the vorticity direction, thus enhancing our understanding of quantum fluid behaviour. This work elucidates the dynamics of Kelvin waves and initiates an approach for manipulating and observing quantized vortices in three dimensions, thereby opening avenues for exploring quantum fluidic systems. In classical hydrodynamics, Kelvin waves refer to helically vibrating normal modes. Experiments now show that quantum analogues of Kelvin waves can be excited in superfluid helium-4.},

This allows us to control the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to alter the reaction products. We also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics, observing a global enhancement of three-body recombination without favouring particular reaction channels. Our control scheme can be extended to other reaction processes and could be combined with other methods, such as quantum interference of reaction paths, to achieve further tuning capabilities of few-body reactions.

  abstract     = {Flat bands in condensed matter systems can host emergent states of matter, from insulating states in twisted bilayer graphene to fractionalized excitations in frustrated magnets and quantum Hall materials. A key phenomenon in certain flat-band systems is Aharonov–Bohm caging, where particles become localized due to destructive interference caused by gauge fields. Here we report on the experimental realization of highly tunable flat-band models populated by strongly interacting Rydberg atoms. By employing synthetic dimensions, we engineer a flat-band rhombic lattice with twisted boundaries and explore the control of Aharonov–Bohm caging during non-equilibrium dynamics through a tunable gauge field. Microscopic measurements of Rydberg pairs reveal the interaction-driven breakdown of Aharonov–Bohm caging in the limit of strong dipolar interactions, where lattice bands mix. In the limit of weak interactions, where caging persists, we observe effective magnetism arising from the interaction-driven mixing of degenerate flat-band states. These observations offer insights into emergent phenomena in synthetic quantum materials and expand our understanding of quantum many-body physics in engineered lattice systems. The effect of strong interactions on the physics hosted by flat bands remains largely unexplored in atomic systems. An experiment in a synthetic flat-band lattice now demonstrates an interaction-driven transition from localization to delocalization.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a self-consistent optical thermodynamic framework has emerged that offers a systematic methodology to understand, harness and exploit the complex collective dynamics of multimode nonlinear systems. These developments now allow consideration of a series of long-standing problems in optics, including the prospect of funnelling the entire power flowing in a multimode system into its ground state, for which no methodology currently exists. Here we demonstrate an all-optical Joule–Thomson expansion process mediated by photon–photon interactions whereby the temperature of the optical gas drops abruptly to zero. Our experiments in various configurations of coupled multicore nonlinear waveguide arrangements illustrate how light undergoing expansion-induced cooling can be channelled from arbitrary input states into the fundamental mode with near-unity efficiency. We show that the stability of the post-expansion state is ensured through an irreversible process of energy conversion. The all-optical thermodynamic phenomena explored in this study may enable innovative techniques where various uncorrelated but identical sources are merged into a unified spatially coherent state, offering a route for direct beam combining. An optical thermodynamic framework can describe the complex dynamics in highly multimodal systems. Now, the observation of all-optical Joule–Thompson expansion in an optical gas further validates this thermodynamic approach.},

  abstract     = {Counterflow superfluidity is an anomalous quantum phase that was predicted two decades ago in the context of a two-component Bose–Hubbard model. In this phase, although both components exhibit fluidity, their correlated counterflow currents cancel each other out, resulting in the system behaving as an incompressible Mott insulator. However, realizing and identifying this phase experimentally has proven challenging due to the stringent requirements for a single set-up, including defect-free state preparation, minimal heating during coherent manipulations, and spin- and site-resolved detection of the phases. Here, we report on the observation of counterflow superfluidity in a binary Bose mixture in optical lattices. After preparing a low-entropy spin-Mott state by conveying two spin-1/2 bosonic atoms at every single lattice site to form a doublon, we adiabatically drove the system to the counterflow superfluid phase at approximately 1 nK. We observed features of antipair correlations through site- and spin-resolved quantum-gas microscopy in both real and momentum spaces. Finally, we measured long-range off-diagonal spin correlations in the rotated basis, revealing a correlation length approaching the system size. These techniques and observations demonstrated here provide accessibility to Borromean counterfluids. Counterflow superfluidity is a quantum phase in which two fluid components flow in opposite directions without resistance, cancelling out their overall combined motion. This phase has now been observed in an optical lattice system hosting Bose mixtures.},

We determine the 2S hyperfine splitting in antihydrogen and—by comparing our results with those obtained in hydrogen—constrain the charge–parity–time-reversal symmetry-violating coefficients in the standard model extension framework. Our experimental protocol allows the characterization of the relevant spectral lines in 1 day, representing a 70-fold improvement in the data-taking rate. We show that the spectroscopy is applicable to laser-cooled antihydrogen with important implications for future tests of fundamental symmetries. The ALPHA Collaboration reports measurements of the hyperfine components of the 1S–2S transition in trapped antihydrogen.

  abstract     = {Recent theoretical and experimental breakthroughs have given rise to the emerging field of free-electron quantum optics, reshaping the understanding of free-electron physics. Traditionally rooted in classical electrodynamics, this field now reveals quantum-mechanical features that necessitate the frameworks of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics. This shift compels a re-evaluation of well-established areas, bringing quantum-mechanical corrections to accelerator science and to electron-radiation phenomena. Simultaneously, the ability to shape single-electron wavefunctions opens new possibilities in microscopy and spectroscopy. These developments are primarily driven by innovations in electron microscopy and its intersection with laser science, where laser-driven electron modulation substantially influences quantum electron interactions with light and matter. In this Perspective, we review these developments, highlighting the current challenges and future opportunities. We explore the role of the free electron as a quantum resource, complementing conventional two-level systems and harmonic oscillators. In the coming years, free electrons may offer new modalities for reading and writing quantum information on ultrafast timescales, performing quantum-state tomography, and ultrafast quantum gates on the atomic scale. Free-electron quantum optics is an emerging field that requires a quantum-mechanical description of both the electronic and the optical contributions. This Perspective summarizes recent developments and discusses challenges and opportunities.},
