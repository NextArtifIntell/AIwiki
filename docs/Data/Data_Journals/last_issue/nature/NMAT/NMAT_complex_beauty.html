  abstract     = {Cells can deform their local niche in three dimensions via whole-cell movements such as spreading, migration or volume expansion. These behaviours, occurring over hours to days, influence long-term cell fates including differentiation. Here we report a whole-cell movement that occurs in sliding hydrogels at the minutes timescale, termed cell tumbling, characterized by three-dimensional cell dynamics and hydrogel deformation elicited by heightened seconds-to-minutes-scale cytoskeletal and nuclear activity. Studies inhibiting or promoting the cell tumbling of mesenchymal stem cells show that this behaviour enhances differentiation into chondrocytes. Further, it is associated with a decrease in global chromatin accessibility, which is required for enhanced differentiation. Cell tumbling also occurs during differentiation into other lineages and its differentiation-enhancing effects are validated in various hydrogel platforms. Our results establish that cell tumbling is an additional regulator of stem cell differentiation, mediated by rapid niche deformation and nuclear mechanotransduction. Minutes-scale whole-cell movements fuelled by fast cytoskeletal dynamics and nuclear activity regulate mesenchymal stem cells differentiation into chondrocytes in hydrogels, being another process modulating the stem cell fate.},

  abstract     = {Antibodies are produced when naive B cells differentiate into plasma cells within germinal centres (GCs) of lymphoid tissues. Patients with B cell lymphoma on effective immunotherapies exhibit diminished antibody production, leading to higher infection rates and reduced vaccine efficacy, even after B cell recovery. Current ex vivo models fail to sustain long-term GC reactions and effectively test B cell responses. Here we developed synthetic hydrogels mimicking the lymphoid tissue microenvironment, enabling human GCs from tonsils and peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived B cells. Immune organoids derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells maintain GC B cells and plasma cells longer than tonsil-derived ones and exhibit unique B cell programming, including GC compartments, somatic hypermutation, immunoglobulin class switching and B cell clones. Chemical inhibition of transcriptional and epigenetic processes enhances plasma cell formation. While integrating polarized CXCL12 protein in a lymphoid organ-on-chip modulates GC responses in healthy donor B cells, it fails with B cells derived from patients with lymphoma. Our system allows rapid, controlled modelling of immune responses and B cell disorders. Synthetic hydrogels and immune organs-on-chip mimicking human immune tissue developed from blood samples allow effective modelling of immune responses and B cell disorders, with implications for the development of improved immunotherapies and vaccines.},

  abstract     = {A successful therapeutic outcome in the treatment of solid tumours requires efficient intratumoural drug accumulation and retention. Here we demonstrate that zinc gluconate in oral supplements assembles with plasma proteins to form ZnO nanoparticles that selectively accumulate into papillary Caki-2 renal tumours and promote the recruitment of dendritic cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to tumour tissues. Renal tumour targeting is mediated by the preferential binding of zinc ions to metallothionein-1X proteins, which are constitutively overexpressed in Caki-2 renal tumour cells. This binding event further upregulates intracellular metallothionein-1X expression to induce additional nanoparticle binding and retention. In both tumour animal models and human renal tumour samples, we show that ZnO nanoparticles actively cross the vascular wall to achieve high intratumoural accumulation. We further explore this feature of ZnO nanoparticles for the delivery of chemotherapeutics to mouse and rabbit cancer models. Our findings demonstrate that ZnO nanoparticles derived from supplements can serve as a multifunctional drug delivery and cancer immunotherapy platform. Zinc gluconate in oral supplements associates with plasma proteins to form renal-tumour-accumulating ZnO nanoparticles, which have antitumoural immune activity and can also be used for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents.},

  abstract     = {The shape of biological matter is central to cell function at different length scales and determines how cellular components recognize, interact and respond to one another. However, their shapes are often transient and hard to reprogramme. Here we construct a synthetic cell model composed of signal-responsive DNA nanorafts, biogenic pores and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We demonstrate that reshaping of DNA rafts at the nanoscale can be coupled to reshaping of GUVs at the microscale. The nanorafts collectively undergo reversible transitions between isotropic and short-range local order on the lipid membrane, programmably remodelling the GUV shape. Assisted by the biogenic pores, during GUV shape recovery the locally ordered DNA rafts perforate the membrane, forming sealable synthetic channels for large cargo transport. Our work outlines a versatile platform for interfacing reconfigurable DNA nanostructures with synthetic cells, expanding the potential of DNA nanotechnology in synthetic biology. The shape of biological matter is central to their function and interaction with other cellular components. A combination of DNA origami nanorafts with biogenic pores reversibly controls the shape and permeability of lipid vesicles at the microscale.},

  abstract     = {Supercooled liquids display sluggish dynamics, often attributed to their structural characteristics, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we conduct numerical investigations into the structure–dynamics relationship in model glass-forming liquids, with a specific focus on an elementary particle rearrangement mode known as the ‘T1 process’. We discover that the ability of a T1 process to preserve glassy structural order before and after is pivotal towards determining a liquid’s fragility—whether it exhibits super-Arrhenius-like or Arrhenius-like behaviour. If a T1 process disrupts local structural order, it must occur independently without cooperativity, resulting in Arrhenius-like behaviour. By contrast, if it can maintain order, it sequentially propagates from disordered peripheries to the middle of high-structural-order regions, leading to cooperativity and super-Arrhenius-like behaviour. Our study establishes a microscopic link between liquid-structure ordering, dynamic cooperativity and super-Arrhenius-like dynamics, extending the understanding of the structure–dynamics relationships in supercooled liquids. An elementary particle rearrangement mode known as the T1 process links liquid dynamics and local structural ordering to understand the physical mechanisms of super-Arrhenius-like behaviour in glass-forming liquids.},

This control is central to such diverse fields as molecular optoelectronics, quantum sensing, quantum biology and spin chemistry, but its effect is typically fairly weak in pure molecular systems. Here we introduce hybrid radical pairs constructed from semiconductor quantum dots and organic molecules. The large g-factor difference enables us to directly observe the radical-pair spin quantum beats usually hidden in previous studies, which are further accelerated by the strong exchange coupling of radical pairs enabled by the quantum confinement of quantum dots. The rapid quantum beats enable the efficient and coherent control of charge recombination dynamics at room temperature, with the modulation level of the yield of spin-triplet products reaching 400%. Photochemical quantum process in quantum dot–molecule hybrids is normally weak and difficult to be coherently controlled. Radical-pair spin quantum beats can enable the efficient and coherent control of charge recombination at room temperature.},

However, the substantial open-circuit voltage loss in the wide-bandgap perovskite subcell hinders further improvements in power-conversion efficiency. Here we develop wide-bandgap perovskite films with improved (100) crystal orientation that suppress non-radiative recombination. We show that using two-dimensional perovskite as an intermediate phase on the film surface promotes heterogeneous nucleation along the (100) three-dimensional perovskite facets during crystallization. Preferred (100) orientations can be realized by augmenting the quantity of two-dimensional phases through surface composition engineering, without the need for excessive two-dimensional ligands that otherwise impede carrier transport. We demonstrate an open-circuit voltage of 1.373 V for 1.78 eV wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, along with a high fill factor of 84.7%. This yields an open-circuit voltage of 2.21 V and a certified power-conversion efficiency of 29.1% for all-perovskite tandem solar cells, measured under the maximum power-point conditions. Substantial open-circuit voltage loss and inherent non-radiative recombination hinder efficiency improvements in wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells. Here the authors augment two-dimensional perovskite phases on the surface to promote (100) facet growth on three-dimensional perovskite facets, improving the open-circuit voltage and efficiency of the resulting wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) hold great promise for next-generation safe, durable and energy-dense battery technology. However, solid-state sulfur conversion reactions are kinetically sluggish and primarily constrained to the restricted three-phase boundary area of sulfur, carbon and solid electrolytes, making it challenging to achieve high sulfur utilization. Here we develop and implement mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIECs) in sulfur cathodes to replace conventional solid electrolytes and invoke conversion reactions at sulfur–MIEC interfaces in addition to traditional three-phase boundaries. Microscopic and tomographic analyses reveal the emergence of mixed-conducting domains embedded in sulfur at sulfur–MIEC boundaries, helping promote the thorough conversion of active sulfur into Li2S. Consequently, substantially improved active sulfur ratios (up to 87.3%) and conversion degrees (&amp;gt;94%) are achieved in Li–S ASSBs with high discharge capacity (&amp;gt;1,450 mAh g–1) and long cycle life (&amp;gt;1,000 cycles). The strategy is also applied to enhance the active material utilization of other conversion cathodes. Low-cost conversion cathodes are promising for future all-solid-state battery technology, but their poor electronic and ionic conductivity restrict reactions to three-phase boundaries. By using mixed ionic–electronic conductors, conversion reactions can be initiated at two-phase boundaries, resulting in enhanced discharge capacity and lifespan.},

Unlike conventional Na3V2(PO4)3, when used as positive electrode materials in Na-ion batteries, the NaxV2(PO4)3 compositions lead to unusual single-phase Na+ extraction/insertion mechanisms with continuous voltage changes upon Na+ extraction/insertion. We demonstrate that the average equilibrium operating voltage observed upon Na+ deintercalation from single-phase Na2V2(PO4)3 is increased up to an average value of ~3.70 V versus Na+/Na (thanks to the activation of the V4+/V5+ redox couple) compared to 3.37 V versus Na+/Na in conventional Na3V2(PO4)3, thus leading to an increase in the theoretical energy density from 396.3 Wh kg–1 to 458.1 Wh kg–1. Electrochemical and chemical Na+ deintercalation from c-Na2V2(PO4)3 enables complete Na-ion extraction, increasing energy density. Single-phase NaxV2(PO4)3 compositions obtained by annealing mixtures of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 enable the complete electrochemical extraction of Na+ through the activation of the V4+/V5+ couple.

In van der Waals antiferromagnets, a new type of magnetic polymorphism arises, presenting multiple layer-selective magnetic structures with identical total magnetization. However, resolving and manipulating such magnetic polymorphs remain challenging. Here, phase-resolved magnetic second harmonic generation microscopy is used to elucidate magnetic polymorphism in 2D layered antiferromagnet CrSBr, demonstrating deterministic and layer-selective switching of magnetic polymorphs. Using a nonlinear magneto-optical technique, we unambiguously resolve the polymorphic spin-flip transitions in CrSBr bilayers and tetralayers through both the amplitude and phase of light. Remarkably, the deterministic routing of polymorphic spin-flip transitions originates from a ‘layer-sharing’ effect, where the transitions are governed by laterally extended layers acting as ‘control bits’. We envision that such controllable magnetic polymorphism could be ubiquitous for van der Waals layered antiferromagnets, enabling new designs and constructions of spintronic and opto-spintronic devices for probabilistic computation and neuromorphic engineering.

  abstract     = {Driving spin systems to states far from equilibrium is indispensable in investigations of functional nonlinearities of antiferromagnets for spintronics. So far, it has been shown that electric-field pulses in the spectral region from the visible to the terahertz range can be used to induce ultrafast switching between different spin states. Here we demonstrate that a multicycle terahertz magnetic-field pulse can be used to induce non-thermal spin switching in antiferromagnets. When a strong pulse is applied to Sm0.7Er0.3FeO3, the magnetic order parameter is first driven away from the barrier between the two potential minima of this antiferromagnet and then, in the subsequent inertial motion towards the opposite direction, it crosses the barrier. Our analysis reveals that the initial motion is driven by a dynamical modification of the magnetic potential, and this modification is enhanced through coupling between the two magnon modes. The authors realize non-thermal spin switching in a canted antiferromagnet through dynamically modifying the magnetic potential using a strong multicycle terahertz magnetic near field.},

  abstract     = {Chirality, a basic property of symmetry breaking, is crucial for fields such as biology and physics. Recent advances in the study of chiral systems have stimulated interest in the discovery of symmetry-breaking states that enable exotic phenomena such as spontaneous gyrotropic order and superconductivity. Here we examine the interaction between light chirality and electron spins in indium selenide and study the effect of magnetic field on emerging tunnelling photocurrents at the Van Hove singularity. Although the effect is symmetric under linearly polarized light excitation, a non-symmetric signal emerges when the excitation is circularly polarized, making it possible to electrically detect light’s chirality. Our study shows a negligible out-of-plane g-factor for few-layer indium selenide at the valence band edge, resulting in an unbalanced Zeeman splitting in hexagonal boron nitride spin bands. This finding allows us to measure the change in energy barrier height with exceptional resolution (~15 μeV). Furthermore, we confirm the long-standing theoretical prediction of spin-polarized hole accumulation in the flat valence band at increasing laser powers. Light chirality and electron spin interactions and the dependence of tunnelling photocurrent on the magnetic field are studied in indium selenide, exploiting its non-symmetric response to circularly polarized light to electrically detect chirality.},

  abstract     = {Active optical metasurfaces, capable of dynamically manipulating light in ultrathin form factors, enable novel interfaces between humans and technology. In such interfaces, soft materials bring many advantages based on their flexibility, compliance and large stimulus-driven responses. Here, we create electrochemically mutable, soft metasurfaces that capitalize on the swelling of soft conducting polymers to alter the shape and associated resonant response of metasurface elements. Such geometric tuning overcomes the typical trade-off between achieving substantial tuning and low optical loss that is intrinsic to dynamic metasurfaces relying on index tuning of materials. Using the commercial polymer PEDOT:PSS, we demonstrate dynamic, high-resolution colour tuning and high-diffraction-efficiency (&amp;gt;19%) beam-steering devices that operate at CMOS-compatible voltages (~1.5 V). These results highlight how the deformability of soft materials can enable a class of high-performance metasurfaces that are suitable for body-worn technologies. Electrochemically mutable soft metasurfaces based on soft conducting polymers exploit the deformability of soft materials through swelling to dynamically tune the shape and associated resonant response of the metasurface devices.},

  abstract     = {The downscaling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology has produced breakthroughs in electronics, but more extreme scaling has hit a wall of device performance degradation. One key challenge is the development of insulators with high dielectric constant, wide bandgap and high tunnel masses. Here, we show that two-dimensional monocrystalline gadolinium pentoxide, which is devised through combining particle swarm optimization algorithm and theoretical calculations and synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy, could exhibit a high dielectric constant of ~25.5 and a wide bandgap simultaneously. A desirable equivalent oxide thickness down to 1 nm with an ultralow leakage current of ~10−4 A cm−2 even at 5 MV cm−1 is achieved. The molybdenum disulfide transistors gated by gadolinium pentoxide exhibit high on/off ratios over 108 and near-Boltzmann-limit subthreshold swing at an operation voltage of 0.5 V. We also constructed inverter circuits with high gain and nanowatt power consumption. This reliable approach to integrating ultrathin monocrystalline insulators paves the way to future nanoelectronics. Two-dimensional monocrystalline gadolinium pentoxide with high dielectric constant and wide bandgap was prepared through van der Waals epitaxy, allowing the realization of sub-1 nm equivalent oxide thickness and low-power nanoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Batch production of single-crystal two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides is one prerequisite for the fabrication of next-generation integrated circuits. Contemporary strategies for the wafer-scale high-quality crystallinity of 2D materials centre on merging unidirectionally aligned, differently sized domains. However, an imperfectly merged area with a translational lattice brings about a high defect density and low device uniformity, which restricts the application of the 2D materials. Here we establish a liquid-to-solid crystallization in 2D space that can rapidly grow a centimetre-scale single-crystal MoS2 domain with no grain boundaries. The large MoS2 single crystal obtained shows superb uniformity and high quality with an ultra-low defect density. A statistical analysis of field effect transistors fabricated from the MoS2 reveals a high device yield and minimal variation in mobility, positioning this FET as an advanced standard monolayer MoS2 device. This 2D Czochralski method has implications for fabricating high-quality and scalable 2D semiconductor materials and devices. A 2D Czochralski method is introduced for rapidly growing centimetre-scale single-crystal MoS2 domains with low defect density and impressive electrical performance. This method shows potential for fabricating high-quality and scalable 2D semiconductor materials and devices.},
