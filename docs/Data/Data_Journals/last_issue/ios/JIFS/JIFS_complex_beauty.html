  abstract     = {In recent times, the rapid advancement of deep learning has led to increased interest in utilizing Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for automatic speech recognition. However, due to the significant variation observed in EEG signals from different individuals, the field of EEG-based speech recognition faces challenges related to individual differences across subjects, which ultimately impact recognition performance. In this investigation, a novel approach is proposed for EEG-based speech recognition that combines the capabilities of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Graph Attention Network (GAT). The LSTM component of the model is designed to process sequential patterns within the data, enabling it to capture temporal dependencies and extract pertinent features. On the other hand, the GAT component exploits the interconnections among data points, which may represent channels, nodes, or features, in the form of a graph. This innovative model not only delves deeper into the connection between connectivity features and thinking as well as speaking states, but also addresses the challenge of individual disparities across subjects. The experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach. When considering the thinking state, the average accuracy for single subjects and cross-subject are 65.7% and 67.3% respectively. Similarly, for the speaking state, the average accuracies were 65.4% for single subjects and 67.4% for cross-subject conditions, all based on the KaraOne dataset. These outcomes highlight the model’s positive impact on the task of cross-subject EEG speech recognition. The motivations for conducting cross subject are real world applicability, Generalization, Adaptation and personalization and performance evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Precise video moment retrieval is crucial for enabling users to locate specific moments within a large video corpus. This paper presents Interactive Moment Localization with Multimodal Fusion (IMF-MF), a novel interactive moment localization with multimodal fusion model that leverages the power of self-attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance. IMF-MF effectively integrates query context and multimodal features, including visual and audio information, to accurately localize moments of interest. The model operates in two distinct phases: feature fusion and joint representation learning. The first phase dynamically calculates fusion weights for adapting the combination of multimodal video content, ensuring that the most relevant features are prioritized. The second phase employs bi-directional attention to tightly couple video and query features into a unified joint representation for moment localization. This joint representation captures long-range dependencies and complex patterns, enabling the model to effectively distinguish between relevant and irrelevant video segments. The effectiveness of IMF-MF is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets: TVR for closed-world TV episodes and Charades for open-world user-generated videos, DiDeMo dataset, Open-world, diverse video moment retrieval dataset. The empirical results indicate that the proposed approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy, as evaluated by metrics like Recall (R1, R5, R10, and R100) and Intersection-of-Union (IoU). The results consistently demonstrate IMF-MF’s superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the benefits of its innovative interactive moment localization approach and the use of self-attention for feature representation and attention modeling.},

  abstract     = {In the expansive domain of data-driven research, the curse of dimensionality poses challenges such as increased computational complexity, noise sensitivity, and the risk of overfitting models. Dimensionality reduction is vital to handle high-dimensional datasets effectively. The pilot study disease dataset (PSD) with 53 features contains patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Osteoarthritis (OA). Our work aims to reduce the dimension of the features in the PSD dataset, identify a suitable feature selection technique for the reduced-dimensional dataset, analyze an appropriate Machine Learning (ML) model, select significant features to predict the RA and OA disease and reveal significant features that predict the arthritis disease. The proposed study, Progressive Feature Reduction with Varied Missing Data (PFRVMD), was employed to reduce the dimension of features by using PCA loading scores in the random value imputed PSD dataset. Subsequently, notable feature selection methods, such as backward feature selection, the Boruta algorithm, the extra tree classifier, and forward feature selection, were implemented on the reduced-dimensional feature set. The significant features/biomarkers are obtained from the best feature selection technique. ML models such as the K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier (KNNC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) are used to determine the best feature selection method. The results indicated that the Extra Tree Classifier (ETC) is the promising feature selection method for the PSD dataset because the significant features obtained from ETC depicted the highest accuracy on SVC.},

The reason is that their algorithms outperform others only in some aspects such as the estimation accuracy or the computation load. To solve the problem of performance evaluation of state estimation algorithms, in this paper, the comprehensive evaluation measures (CEM) for evaluating the nonlinear estimation algorithm (NEA) is proposed, which can comprehensively reflect the performance of the NEAs. First, we introduce three types of the NEAs. Second, the CEM combining the flatness, estimation accuracy and computation time of the NEAs, is designed to evaluate the above NEAs. Finally, the superiority of the CEM is verified by a numerical example, which helps decision makers of nonlinear estimation algorithms theoretically and technically.},

However, mainstream ESG rating methods ignore the distinction between companies with incomplete information disclosure and companies without information disclosure, which decreases the initiative and enthusiasm of companies to disclose information. In this study, a self-disclosure ESG (SDESG) rating method is proposed to evaluate companies’ ESG performance capabilities. First, based on the fuzzy set, fuzzy data is defined and applied to the SDESG rating method. Second, analogous to the academic reward system of a university, a reward mechanism of disclosure is used in the SDESG rating method. Finally, the effectiveness and reliability of the SDESG rating method are demonstrated through Refinitiv’s case. The results show that the SDESG rating method can distinguish companies with incomplete information disclosure from companies without information disclosure and allow companies that proactively disclose information to obtain better ESG scores under each industry. The implications of the study would increase companies’ enthusiasm to disclose information and maintain transparency within a company.},

The contributions of this paper are (i) Development of license plate database for 547 Indian cars, (ii) Development of an image dataset with 3173 images of 547 Indian cars in 8 classes, (iii) Development of an ensemble model to recognize vehicle make and model from frontal, rear, and side images, and (iv) Development of a framework to authenticate the license plates with frontal, rear, and side images.

  abstract     = {Accurate SARS-CoV-2 screening is made possible by automated Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) which reduces the stress on healthcare systems. Since Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious, the transition chain can be broken through an early diagnosis by clinical knowledge and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Manual findings are time and labor-intensive. Even if Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) delivers quick findings, Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is still a more trustworthy tool for disease classification and assessment. Several studies have been conducted using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for COVID-19 detection. One of the biggest challenges in modernizing healthcare is extracting useful data from high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and complex biological data. Intending to introduce an automated COVID-19 diagnosis model, this paper develops a proficient optimization model that enhances the classification performance with better accuracy. The input images are initially pre-processed with an image filtering approach for noise removal and data augmentation to extend the dataset. Secondly, the images are segmented via U-Net and are given to classification using the Fused U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (FUCNN) model. Here, the performance of U-Net is enhanced through the modified Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithm named Chaotic System-based MFO (CSMFO) by optimizing the weights of U-Net. The significance of the implemented model is confirmed over a comparative evaluation with the state-of-the-art models. Specifically, the proposed CSMFO-FUCNN attained 98.45% of accuracy, 98.63% of sensitivity, 98.98% of specificity, and 98.98% of precision.},

By taking Gaussian linear fuzzy information granules as inputs and outputs, GF-Prophet predicts with significantly smaller cumulative error. Second, noticing that trend extraction affects prediction accuracy seriously, a novel granulation modification algorithm is proposed to merge adjacent information granules that do not have significant differences. This is the first attempt to establish Prophet based on fuzzy information granules to predict trend characteristics. Experiments on public datasets show that the introduction of Gaussian linear fuzzy information granules significantly improves prediction performance of traditional Prophet model. Compared with other classical models, GF-Prophet has not only higher prediction accuracy, but also better interpretability, which can clearly give the change information, fluctuation amplitude and duration of a certain trend in the future that investors actually pay attention to.},

Traffic congestion not only increases travel time but also increases noise pollution, air pollution, and financial losses. There are many factors which affect the speed of a vehicle. Some of the factors are weather, wind speed, road conditions, and construction work. On highways, the low speed of vehicles can cause traffic congestion or delays. Machine learning can play a vital role in the detection of traffic congestion and hence in avoiding delays. When accurate parameters and correct structure are fed to the machine learning model, traffic congestion can be predicted accurately. This paper designs a technique to predict traffic congestion states with the help of the Extra Tree Classifier machine learning model. The proposed Extremely Randomized Machine Learning (ERML) system model predicts 94% accuracy for congestion state classification.
