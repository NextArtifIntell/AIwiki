These -gap breathers are the counterparts to the classical space-localized and time-periodic breathers found in space-periodic systems. Using normal form transformations, we establish rigorously the existence of such solutions with oscillating tails (in the time domain) that can be made arbitrarily small but finite. Due to the presence of the oscillating tails, these solutions are coined generalized -gap breathers. Using a multiple-scale analysis, we also derive a tractable amplitude equation that describes the dynamics of breathers in the limit of small amplitude. In the presence of damping, we demonstrate the existence of transition fronts that connect the trivial state to the time-periodic ones. The analytical results are corroborated by systematic numerical simulations.},

In this paper, we describe the loss of deterministically stable behavior in a fundamental fluid mechanics problem, conditional to whether noise is introduced in the sense of Itô, Stratonovich, or a limit of Wong–Zakai type. We examine this comparison in the wider context of discretizing stochastic differential equations with and without the Lévy area. We study stochastic advection by Lie transport and its derivation from homogenization theory, which introduces drift corrections of the same class naturally. From a numerical viewpoint, we demonstrate that performing higher order discretizations with the use of a Lévy area can also lead to the loss of conserved area and angle quantities. Such behavior is not physically expected in the Stratonovich model. From the viewpoint of homogenization, the qualitative properties of the Wong–Zakai anomaly are physically motivated as arising due to correlations from a fast and mean scale fluid decomposition.},

Here we investigate the existence of families of symmetric periodic solutions as continuation of the elliptic orbits of the three-dimensional Kepler problem for certain symmetric differentiable perturbations using Delaunay coordinates. We consider spatial perturbations of the nonrotating and the rotating Kepler problem that are invariant with respect to some discrete reflection symmetries or have axial symmetry. More precisely, we characterize the sufficient conditions for their existence, and their type of stability is studied by estimating the characteristic multipliers of the symmetric periodic solutions. In addition, we present some results which establish a relation between symmetric periodic solutions obtained by the analytical continuation method and those obtained by the averaging method for 3-DOF Hamiltonian systems. Our study first takes into account that in each method it is necessary to find points from which the initial conditions that generating the families of periodic solutions bifurcate. By imposing a discrete symmetry on the average function, we can relate the previous points. Second, we show that the non-degeneracy condition for the application of the averaging method implies the non-degeneracy condition of the Poincaré continuation method. Finally, we compare the periods and characteristic multipliers of the family of periodic solutions obtained by each method. New families of periodic solutions for the generalized hydrogen atom in external electric and magnetic fields and for the hydrogen atom in van der Waals potential combined with a magnetic field are obtained as an application of our main results.},

We show theoretically the validity of our approach and demonstrate via numerical experiments that it exhibits significant improvements over existing methods in solving prediction problems, especially those with large state or parameter dimensions, and those possessing strongly nonlinear dynamics.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper deals with the problem of simulating dense dispersed systems composed of large numbers of particles undergoing ballistic aggregation. The most classical approaches for dealing with such problems are represented by the so-called event-driven methods. Despite being more accurate, these methods become computationally very expensive as the number of particles increases. Typically, their computational cost is proportional to the square of the number of particles, and thus they become extremely demanding as soon as this number becomes sufficiently large. An alternative approach, called time stepping, consists in evolving the problem over small time intervals and handling all collisions occurring during each time interval simultaneously. In this work, we follow this second direction and introduce a new time stepping method which recasts the problem of the multiple collisions in a minimization framework. The objective of this work is twofold: The first goal is to show that the statistical description of the resulting aggregates obtained with this new time stepping method is sufficiently close to that of the event-driven methods. The second goal consists in showing that, in terms of computational performances, this new approach is competitive and may outperform standard methodologies, especially when the number of particles becomes sufficiently large. Numerical results obtained in the case of spherical particles moving in a two-dimensional box show that these two properties are indeed satisfied.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate an interacting particle model to simulate a foraging colony of ants, where each ant is represented as an active Brownian particle. The interactions among ants are mediated through chemotaxis, aligning their orientations with the upward gradient of the pheromone field. Unlike conventional models, our study introduces a parameter that enables the reproduction of two distinctive behaviors, the well-known Keller–Segel aggregation into spots and the formation of traveling clusters, without relying on external constraints such as food sources or nests. We consider the associated mean-field limit partial differential equation (PDE) of this system and establish the analytical and numerical foundations for understanding these particle behaviors. Remarkably, the mean-field PDE not only supports aggregation spots and lane formation but also unveils a bistable region where these two behaviors compete. The patterns associated with these phenomena are elucidated by the shape of the growing eigenfunctions derived from linear stability analysis. This study not only contributes to our understanding of complex ant colony dynamics but also introduces a novel parameter-dependent perspective on pattern formation in collective systems.},

We consider a class of birth/death like process corresponding to coupled biochemical reactions and consider the problem of quantifying the variance of the molecular species in terms of the rates of the reactions. In particular, we address this problem in a configuration where a species is formed with a rate that depends nonlinearly on another spontaneously formed species. By making use of an appropriately formulated expansion based on the Newton series, in conjunction with spectral properties of the master equation, we derive an analytical expression that provides a hard bound for the variance. We show that this bound is exact when the propensities are linear, with numerical simulations demonstrating that this bound is also very close to the actual variance. An analytical expression for the covariance of the species is also derived.},

In particular, we address the extent to which the time series at a node of the network can be successfully reconstructed when measuring from another node, or subset of nodes, corrupted by observational noise. We will assume the dynamical equations of the network are known, and that the dynamics are not necessarily low-dimensional. The case of linear dynamics is treated first and leads to a definition of observation error magnification factor (OEMF) that measures the magnification of noise in the reconstruction process. Subsequently, the definition is applied to nonlinear and chaotic dynamics. Comparison of OEMF for different target/observer combinations can lead to better understanding of how to optimally observe a network. As part of the study, a computational method for reconstructing time series from partial observations is presented and analyzed.},

These qualities include the locations of periodic orbits, magnetic islands, and chaotic regions of phase space. However, every evaluation of the magnetic return map requires solving an ODE, meaning a detailed Poincaré plot can be expensive to create. Here, we propose a kernel-based method of learning a single labeling function that is approximately invariant under the symplectic map. From the labeling function, we can recover the locations of invariant circles, islands, and chaos with few evaluations of the underlying symplectic map. Additionally, the labeling function comes with a residual, which serves as a measure of how invariant the label function is and therefore as an indirect measure of chaos and map complexity.},

Control-based continuation (CBC) is a general and systematic method to explore the dynamic response of a physical system and perform bifurcation analysis directly during experimental tests. Although CBC has been successfully demonstrated on a wide range of systems, rigorous and general approaches to designing a noninvasive controller underpinning the methodology are still lacking. In this paper, a noninvasive adaptive control strategy for a wide class of nonlinear systems with unknown parameters is proposed. We prove that the proposed adaptive control methodology is such that the states of the dynamical system track a reference signal in a noninvasive manner if and only if the reference is a response of the uncontrolled system to an excitation force. Compared to the existing literature, the proposed method does not require any a priori knowledge of some system parameters, does not require a persistent excitation, and is not restricted to linearly stable systems, facilitating the application of CBC to a much larger class of systems than before. Rigorous mathematical analyses are provided, and the proposed control method is numerically demonstrated on a range of single- and multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear systems, including a Duffing oscillator with multiple static equilibria. It is especifically shown that the unstable periodic orbits of the uncontrolled systems can be stabilized and reached, noninvasively, in controlled conditions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Suppose one wants to monitor a domain with sensors, each sensing a small ball-shaped region, but the domain is hazardous enough that one cannot control the placement of the sensors. A prohibitively large number of randomly placed sensors could be required to obtain static coverage. Instead, one can use fewer sensors by providing mobile coverage, a generalization of the static setup wherein every possible evader is detected by the moving sensors in a bounded amount of time. Here, we use topology in order to implement algorithms certifying mobile coverage that use only local data to solve the global problem. Our algorithms do not require knowledge of the sensors’ locations, only their connectivity information. We experimentally study the statistics of mobile coverage in two dynamical scenarios. We allow the sensors to move independently (billiard dynamics and Brownian motion), or to locally coordinate their dynamics (collective animal motion models). Our detailed simulations show, for example, that collective motion can enhance performance: The expected time until the mobile sensor network achieves mobile coverage is lower for the D’Orsogna collective motion model than for the billiard motion model. Further, we show that even when the probability of static coverage is low, all possible evaders can nevertheless be detected relatively quickly by the mobile sensor network.},

Our results are valid in an asymptotic regime which corresponds to a reaction with high activation energy, and they provide a rigorous and geometrically informative counterpart to formal asymptotic results that have been obtained for similar problems using high activation energy asymptotics. We also go beyond the existing results by (i) proving smoothness of the minimum wave speed function , where is the small parameter, and (ii) providing an asymptotic series for a flat slow manifold which plays a role in the construction of traveling wave solutions for nonminimal wave speeds . The analysis is complicated by the presence of an exponential nonlinearity which leads to two different scaling regimes as , which we refer to herein as the convective-diffusive and diffusive-reactive zones. The main idea of the proof is to use the geometric blow-up method to identify and characterize a -family of heteroclinic orbits which traverse both of these regimes, and correspond to traveling waves in the original ZFK equation. More generally, our analysis contributes to a growing number of studies which demonstrate the utility of geometric blow-up approaches to the study of dynamical systems with singular exponential nonlinearities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a well-established method to generate a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for analysis and prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems. Recently, kernel EDMD (kEDMD) has gained popularity due to its ability to resolve the challenging task of choosing a suitable dictionary by using the kernel’s canonical features and, thus, data-informed observables. In this paper, we provide the first pointwise bounds on the approximation error of kEDMD. The main idea consists of two steps. First, we show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Wendland functions are invariant under the Koopman operator. Second, exploiting that the learning problem given by regression in the native norm can be recast as an interpolation problem, we prove our novel error bounds by using interpolation estimates. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we present a purely data-driven method that uses the Loewner framework along with nonlinear optimization techniques to infer quadratic dynamical systems with affine control that admit Volterra series (VS) representations from input-output time-domain measurements. The proposed method extensively employs optimization tools for interpolating the symmetric generalized frequency response functions (GFRFs) derived in the VS framework. The GFRF estimations are obtained from the Fourier spectrum (phase and amplitude) of the quasi-steady-state system response under harmonic excitation. Appropriate treatment of these measurements under the developed framework allows the identification of low-order in-state dimension quadratic state-space models with nontrivial stable equilibria, such as in the Lorenz ’63 forced system. We thus can achieve low-order global model identification for certain classes of systems that can bifurcate to multiple equilibria after collecting measurements solely from a local stable operational regime. The advanced framework rigorously tests the identification and reduction features across various examples with increasing dimensions and varying complexities. It effectively addresses the inference of a reduced model from measurements of a viscous flow, assuming adherence to the Burgers’ model with Robin boundary conditions. These results provide new prospects for developing low-order predictive models based on input-output data suitable for control.},

Geometrically, this description is organized by asymptotic phase of invariant sets on the horizon. Blow-up solutions in nonautonomous systems can be described in a similar way. As a corollary, normally or partially hyperbolic invariant manifolds on the horizon possessing asymptotic phase are shown to induce blow-ups.},

Here, we present a method for the projection-based model reduction of canonical Hamiltonian systems that is variationally consistent for any choice of linear reduced basis: Hamiltonian models project to Hamiltonian models. Applicable in both intrusive and nonintrusive settings, the proposed method is energy-conserving and symplectic, with error provably decomposable into a data projection term and a term measuring deviation from canonical form. Examples from linear elasticity with realistic material parameters are used to demonstrate the advantages of a variationally consistent approach, highlighting the steady convergence exhibited by consistent models where previous methods reliant on inconsistent techniques or specially designed bases exhibit unacceptably large errors.},

First, periodic orbits in the Circular Restricted 3-Body Problem (CR3BP) representation of the Earth-Moon (EM) system were identified. A Melnikov-type function was used to identify a set of candidate points on the EM CR3BP periodic orbits to start a continuation algorithm. A pseudo-arclength continuation scheme was then used to obtain the corresponding periodic orbit families in the HR4BP when including the effect of the Sun. Bifurcation points were identified in the computed families to obtain additional orbit families.},

We present a new approach to detect the zeros of the slow divergence integral by studying the structure of the set of all probability measures invariant under the corresponding slow relation function. Using the slow relation function, we also show how to estimate (in terms of weak convergence) the transformation of families of probability measures that describe initial point distribution of canard orbits during the passage near a slow-fast Hopf point (or a more general turning point). We provide formulas to compute exit densities for given entry densities and the slow relation function. We apply our results to slow-fast Liénard equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to a combination of noise and time-varying forcing can exhibit sudden changes, critical transitions, or tipping points, where large or rapid dynamic effects arise from changes in a parameter that are small or slow. Noise-induced tipping can occur where extremes of the forcing cause the system to leave one attractor and transition to another. We consider tipping in the presence of bounded chaotic forcing; previous work has primarily modelled noise forcing via a stochastic differential equation, but this is only a good model of chaotic forcing in the “fast chaos” limit. We argue that for low amplitude chaotic forcing close to a parameter value where there is a bifurcation of the unforced system, there will be a chaotic tipping window outside of which tipping cannot happen in the limit of asymptotically slow change of that parameter. This window is trivial for a stochastically forced system. Entry into the chaotic tipping window can be via a boundary crisis/nonautonomous saddle-node bifurcation and corresponds to an exceptional trajectory of the forcing, typically by an unstable periodic orbit. We discuss an illustrative example of a chaotically forced bistable map that highlights the richness of the geometry and bifurcation structure of the dynamics in this case. If there is also a ramping of a parameter we note there is a dynamic tipping window that can also be determined in terms of unstable periodic orbits.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When the planar circular restricted 3-body problem (PCRTBP) is periodically perturbed, as occurs in many useful astrodynamics models, most unstable periodic orbits persist as whiskered tori. Intersections between stable and unstable manifolds of such tori provide natural heteroclinic pathways, enabling spacecraft to greatly modify their orbits without using propellant. However, the 2D Poincaré sections used in PCRTBP studies no longer work to find these intersections. Thus, in this study, we develop new fast methods to search for and compute such heteroclinics. First, the dynamics are used to restrict the intersection search to only certain manifold subsets, greatly reducing the required computational effort. Next, we present a massively parallel procedure for carrying out this search by representing the manifolds as discrete meshes and adapting methods from computer graphics collision detection algorithms. Implementing the method in Julia and OpenCL, we obtain a 5–7x speedup by leveraging GPUs versus CPU-only execution. Finally, we show how to use manifold parameterizations to refine the approximate intersections found in the mesh search to very high accuracy, as well as to numerically continue the connections through families of tori; the families’ Whitney differentiability enables interpolation of needed parameterizations. The ability to very rapidly find a heteroclinic intersection between tori of fixed frequencies thus allows the systematic exploration of intersections for tori of nearby frequencies as well, yielding a variety of potential zero-fuel spacecraft trajectories. We demonstrate the tools on the Jupiter–Europa planar elliptic RTBP.},

While many well-established approaches exist for phase-based reduced order modeling of tonically firing neurons, comparatively few general approaches exist for the consideration of bursting neurons in a reduced order setting. Many formal analysis strategies exploit the separation of fast and slow timescales present in most bursting neurons, but these approaches are typically ill-suited to consider emergent behavior resulting from inter-neuron coupling or other external perturbations. This work considers the development and analysis of two different model order reduction approaches valid for two different topological classes of bursting neurons. For parabolic bursters, a persistent invariant circle allows for the relatively straightforward application of the extended phase reduction approach. For elliptic bursters, the perturbed dynamics can be considered relative to a carefully chosen set of reference trajectories. Mathematical analysis and accompanying numerical illustrations demonstrate the utility of the proposed approaches.},

Traditionally, this estimation relies on Lyapunov coefficients. However, in nonsmooth systems, besides the limit cycles bifurcating by varying the Lyapunov coefficients, monodromic singularities on the switching curve can always be split apart, yielding, under suitable conditions, a sliding region and an additional limit cycle surrounding it. This bifurcation phenomenon, known as pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, has enhanced lower-bound cyclicity estimations for monodromic singularities in Filippov systems. In this study, we push beyond the pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, demonstrating that the destruction of -monodromic tangential singularities yields at least limit cycles surrounding sliding segments. This new bifurcation phenomenon expands our understanding of limit cycle bifurcations in nonsmooth systems and, in addition to the theoretical significance, has practical relevance in various applied models involving switches and abrupt processes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Oscillations of free intracellular calcium concentration are thought to be important in the control of a wide variety of physiological phenomena, and there is long-standing interest in understanding these oscillations via the investigation of suitable mathematical models. Many of these models have the feature that different variables or terms in the model evolve on very different time-scales, which often results in the accompanying oscillations being temporally complex. Cloete et al. [J. Theoret. Biol., 503 (2020), 110390] constructed an ordinary differential equation model of calcium oscillations in hepatocytes in an attempt to understand the origin of two distinct types of oscillation observed in experiments: narrow-spike oscillations, in which rapid spikes of calcium concentration alternate with relatively long periods of quiescence, and broad-spike oscillations, in which there is a fast rise in calcium levels followed by a slower decline, then a period of quiescence. These two types of oscillation can be observed in the model if a single system parameter is varied, but the mathematical mechanisms underlying the different types of oscillations were not explored in detail in [Cloete et al., J. Theoret. Biol., 503 (2020), 1103905]. We use ideas from geometric singular perturbation theory to investigate the origin of broad-spike solutions in this model. We find that the analysis is intractable in the full model, but are able to uncover structure in particular singular limits of a related model that point to the origin of the broad-spike solutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider synchronization between a pair of networks of Kuramoto oscillators. One network plays the role of a training network, the other a learning network. Our main result is an adaptive strategy which tunes the Kuramoto coupling strengths (weights) and the Kuramoto frequencies of the learning network to achieve tracking of the phases of the training network by the phases of the learning network. Tracking is proved using a Lyapunov stability approach. When the phases of the training network are not clustered, then the adaptive strategy also guarantees convergence of the learning weights and frequencies to those of the training network. When the phases of the training network are clustered, the adaptive strategy achieve partial convergence of the learning weights and frequencies characterized by the type of clustering of the training network. The results are illustrated by 4-node training and learning networks with a variety of clustering configurations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A numerical investigation is undertaken into the existence and stability of localized patterned states of a two-species activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system posed on the real line. The specific system studied, originally proposed as a glycolisys model, was recently shown to feature a two-parameter bifurcation structure common to many Schnakenberg-like systems. This structure arises from a codimension-two point at which the fundamental pattern forming Turing bifurcation changes criticality. In this paper, we compute the rung states of a “snakes-and-ladders” bifurcation diagram. Owing to the nonvariational structure of reaction-diffusion systems, they represent traveling-wave solutions. Moreover, considering a parameter regime where the localized patterned solutions exist for a wide range of parameters, numerical evidence suggests a more complex topology of the bifurcation diagram reminiscent of, but different from, what has been described as foliated snaking. Finally, we investigate the emergence of branches of breather solutions, as the ratio of diffusion parameters is increased from small values. It is shown how these branches also inherit the snake structure which leads to multiplicity of stable localized breathers of arbitrary wide spatial extent. The results are argued to have wider implications for nonvariational pattern formation systems. In particular, the nascence of traveling and breather states is a first step in the onset for complex spatio-temporal localized structures with permanent dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Lambert problem originated in orbital mechanics. It is concerned with determining the initial velocity for a boundary value problem involving the dynamical constraint due to gravitational potential with additional time horizon and endpoint position constraints. Its solution has application in transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within a prescribed flight time via velocity control. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors is replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is a generalized SBP and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schrödinger factors, as we do in this work. Our analysis leads to solving a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the energy function of the Kuramoto model in random geometric graphs defined in the unit circle as the number of nodes diverges. We prove the existence of at least one local minimum for each winding number with high probability, hence providing a large family of graphs that support patterns that are generic. These states are in correspondence with the explicit twisted states found in WSG and other highly symmetric networks, but in our situation there is no explicit formula due to the lack of symmetry. The method of proof is simple and robust. It allows other types of graphs like nn graphs or the boolean model and holds also for graphs defined in any simple closed curve or even a small neighborhood of the curve and for weighted graphs. It seems plausible that the method can be extended also to higher dimensions, but a more careful analysis is required.},
