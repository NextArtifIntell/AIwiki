Our approach is based on a representation of nonnegative supermartingales proposed by M. A. Urusov and the author of the present paper via a time change in a geometric Brownian motion. We prove a criterion for uniform integrability in terms of a time change and also put forward a new proof of sufficiency of the Novikov condition. It turns out that an elementary alternative proof of this fact can be reduced to its particular case for the stopped geometric Brownian motion.},

Well known is the classical result when one of the statistics is the sample mean and the other is the sample coefficient of variation. In this paper, we elaborate on a version of Anosov&#39;s theorem, which allows us to establish a general result and a series of seven corollaries, providing new characterization results for gamma distributions. We keep the sample mean as one of involved statistics, while the other can be taken from a quite large class of homogeneous feasible definite statistics. We discuss an interesting parallel between the new characterization results for gamma distributions and recent characterization results for the normal distribution.},

  abstract     = {Dedicated to A. N. Shiryaev on his 90th birthday A general diffusion semimartingale is a one-dimensional path-continuous semimartingale that is also a regular strong Markov process. We say that a continuous semimartingale has the representation property if all local martingales w.r.t. its canonical filtration have an integral representation w.r.t. its continuous local martingale part. The representation property is of fundamental interest in the field of mathematical finance, where it is strongly connected to market completeness. The main result from this paper shows that the representation property holds for a general diffusion semimartingale (that is not started in an absorbing boundary point) if and only if its scale function is (locally) absolutely continuous on the interior of the state space. As an application of our main theorem, we deduce that the laws of general diffusion semimartingales with such scale functions are extreme points of their semimartingale problems, and, moreover, we construct a general diffusion semimartingale whose law is no extreme point of its semimartingale problem. These observations contribute to a solution of problems posed by J. Jacod and M. Yor and D. W. Stroock and M. Yor, respectively, on the extremality of strong Markov solutions.},

We establish a link between branching random walks with signed branching sources of various intensities and the structure of the spectrum of the evolutionary operator for the mean population size of particles at the lattice points. In this connection, we solve the problem of the number of eigenvalues of a finite-dimensional non-self-adjoint perturbation $A+B$ of a non-self-adjoint operator $A$ in a real Hilbert space. We prove that the number of eigenvalues of the operator $A+B$ exceeding the upper bound of the spectrum of the operator $A$ is majorized by the number of positive eigenvalues of the operator $B$, and the number of eigenvalues of the operator $A+B$ smaller than the lower bound of the spectrum of the operator $A$ is majorized by the number of negative eigenvalues of the operator $B$.},

Some earlier theoretical results in this direction can be found in the book [R. S. Liptser and A. N. Shiryaev, Statistics of Random Processes, Springer, 2001]. Under an essentially less restrictive setting, we derive formulas for the moments of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the parameter $\lambda $ of the drift coefficient $f_{t}(\lambda )=a_{t}-\lambda b_{t}$ and prove the exponential boundedness of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ under a mild condition. In the provided examples we consider the mean-reverting ergodic diffusion process $\mathbf{X}$, where $b_{t}=X_{t}$, and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma_{t}=\sigma X_{t}^{\gamma }$. In particular, we provide nonasymptotic analytical and numerical results for the bias and mean-square error of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (O--U) and Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) processes when $\tau =T$ is a fixed sample size, and $\tau =\tau_{H}$ is a specially chosen stopping time that guarantees a prescribed magnitude of $1/H$ for the variance of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau_{H}}$.},
