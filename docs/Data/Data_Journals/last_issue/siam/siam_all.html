We present a systematic study of conditional triangular transport maps in function spaces from the perspective of optimal transportation and with a view towards amortized Bayesian inference. More specifically, we develop a theory of constrained optimal transport problems that describe block-triangular Monge maps that characterize conditional measures along with their Kantorovich relaxations. This work generalizes the theory of optimal triangular transport to separable infinite dimensional function spaces with general cost functions. We further tailor our results to the case of Bayesian inference problems and obtain regularity estimates on the conditioning maps from the prior to the posterior. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the computational applicability of our theoretical results for amortized and likelihood-free inference of functional parameters.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many recent and often (adaptive) Markov chain Monte Carlo (A)MCMC methods are associated in practice to unknown rates of convergence. We propose a simulation-based methodology to estimate and compare MCMC’s performance in terms of shortest burn-in time, using a Kullback divergence criterion requiring an estimate of the entropy of the algorithm densities at each iteration, computed from i.i.d. simulated chains. In previous works, we proved some consistency results in an MCMC setup for an entropy estimate based on Monte Carlo integration of a kernel density estimate proposed in [L. Györfi and E. C. Van Der Meulen, An entropy estimate based on a kernel density estimation, in Limit Theorems in Probability and Statistics, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1989, pp. 229–240], and we investigate an alternative nearest neighbor (NN) entropy estimate from [L. Kozachenko and N. N. Leonenko, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii, 23 (1987), pp. 9–16]. This estimate has been used mostly in univariate situations until recently, when entropy estimation in higher dimensions has been considered in other fields like neuroscience or system biology. Unfortunately, in higher dimensions, both estimators converge slowly with a noticeable bias. The present work goes several steps further, with bias reduction and automatic (A)MCMC burn-in time analysis in mind. First, for bias reduction, we apply in our situation a “crossed NN-type” nonparametric estimate of the Kullback divergence between two densities, based on i.i.d. samples from each, introduced by [Q. Wang, S. R. Kulkarni, and S. Verdú, A nearest-neighbor approach to estimating divergence between continuous random vectors, in IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, Seattle, WA, 2006, pp. 242–246], [Q. Wang, S. R. Kulkarni, and S. Verdú, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 55 (2009), pp. 2392–2405]. We prove the consistency of these entropy estimates under recent uniform control conditions, for the successive densities of a generic class of MCMC algorithm to which most of the methods proposed in the recent literature belong. Second, we propose an original solution based on a PCA for reducing relevant dimension and bias in even higher dimensions whenever PCA is efficient. Our algorithms for MCMC simulation and entropy estimation are progressively added to the R package EntropyMCMC, taking advantage of recent advances in high-performance (parallel) computing.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Optimization under uncertainty is important in many applications, particularly to inform policy and decision making in areas such as public health. A key source of uncertainty arises from the incorporation of environmental variables as inputs into computational models or simulators. Such variables represent uncontrollable features of the optimization problem, and reliable decision making must account for the uncertainty they propagate to the simulator outputs. Often, multiple, competing objectives are defined from these outputs such that the final optimal decision is a compromise between different goals. Here, we present emulation-based optimization methodology for such problems that extends expected quantile improvement (EQI) to address multiobjective optimization. Focusing on the practically important case of two objectives, we use a sequential design strategy to identify the Pareto front of optimal solutions. Uncertainty from the environmental variables is integrated out using Monte Carlo samples from the simulator. Interrogation of the expected output from the simulator is facilitated by use of (Gaussian process) emulators. The methodology is demonstrated on an optimization problem from public health involving the dispersion of anthrax spores across a spatial terrain. Environmental variables include meteorological features that impact the dispersion, and the methodology identifies the Pareto front even when there is considerable input uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Functional data are ubiquitous in scientific modeling. For instance, quantities of interest are modeled as functions of time, space, energy, density, etc. Uncertainty quantification methods for computer models with functional response have resulted in tools for emulation, sensitivity analysis, and calibration that are widely used. However, many of these tools do not perform well when the computer model’s parameters control both the amplitude variation of the functional output and its alignment (or phase variation). This paper introduces a framework for Bayesian model calibration when the model responses are misaligned functional data. The approach generates two types of data out of the misaligned functional responses: (1) aligned functions so that the amplitude variation is isolated and (2) warping functions that isolate the phase variation. These two types of data are created for the computer simulation data (both of which may be emulated) and the experimental data. The calibration approach uses both types so that it seeks to match both the amplitude and phase of the experimental data. The framework is careful to respect constraints that arise, especially when modeling phase variation, and is framed in a way that it can be done with readily available calibration software. We demonstrate the techniques on two simulated data examples and on two dynamic material science problems: a strength model calibration using flyer plate experiments and an equation of state model calibration using experiments performed on the Sandia National Laboratories’ Z-machine.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Inspired by multifidelity methods in computer simulations, this article introduces procedures for designing surrogates for the input/output relationship of a high-fidelity code. These surrogates should be learned from runs of both the high-fidelity and low-fidelity codes and be accompanied by error guarantees that are deterministic rather than stochastic. For this purpose, the article advocates a framework tied to a theory focusing on worst-case guarantees, namely optimal recovery. The multifidelity considerations triggered new theoretical results in three scenarios: the globally optimal estimation of linear functionals, the globally optimal approximation of arbitrary quantities of interest in Hilbert spaces, and their locally optimal approximation, still within Hilbert spaces. The latter scenario boils down to the determination of the Chebyshev center for the intersection of two hyperellipsoids. It is worth noting that the mathematical framework presented here, together with its possible extension, seems to be relevant in several other contexts briefly discussed.},

The use of reduced order modeling techniques in combination with ensemble-based methods for estimating the state of systems described by nonlinear partial differential equations has been of great interest in recent years in the data assimilation community. Methods such as the multifidelity ensemble Kalman filter and the multilevel ensemble Kalman filter are recognized as state-of-the-art techniques. However, in many cases, the construction of low-fidelity models in an offline stage, before solving the data assimilation problem, prevents them from being both accurate and computationally efficient. In our work, we investigate the use of adaptive reduced basis techniques in which the approximation space is modified online by combining information extracted from a limited number of full order solutions and information extracted from reduced models trained at previous time steps. This allows us to simultaneously ensure good accuracy and low cost for the employed models and thus improve the performance of the multifidelity and multilevel methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We address the computational efficiency of finding the A-optimal Bayesian experimental design, where the observation map is based on partial differential equations and thus computationally expensive to evaluate. A-optimality is a widely used and easily interpreted criterion, that seeks the optimal experimental design by minimizing the expected conditional variance. Our study presents a novel likelihood-free approach to the A-optimal experimental design that does not require sampling or integration over the Bayesian posterior distribution. In our proposed approach, we estimate the expected conditional variance via the variance of the conditional expectation and approximate the conditional expectation using its orthogonal projection property. We derive an asymptotic error estimate for the proposed estimator of the expected conditional variance and verify it with numerical experiments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the case where the domain of the experimental design parameters is continuous. Specifically, we propose a nonlocal approximation of the conditional expectation using an artificial neural network and apply transfer learning and data augmentation to reduce the number of evaluations of the measurement model. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method greatly reduces the number of measurement model evaluations compared with widely used importance sampling-based approaches.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent studies have confirmed cardiovascular diseases remain responsible for the highest mortality rate among noncommunicable diseases. The accurate left ventricular (LV) volume estimation is critical for valid diagnosis and management of various cardiovascular conditions, but poses a significant challenge due to inherent uncertainties associated with the segmentation algorithms in magnetic resonance imaging. Recent machine learning advancements, particularly U-Net-like convolutional networks, have facilitated automated segmentation for medical images, but struggles under certain pathologies and/or different scanner vendors and imaging protocols. This study proposes a novel methodology for post-hoc uncertainty estimation in the LV volume prediction using Itô stochastic differential equations to model pathwise behavior for the prediction error. The model describes the area of the left ventricle along the heart’s long axis. The method is agnostic to the underlying segmentation algorithm, facilitating its use with various existing and future segmentation technologies. The proposed approach provides a mechanism for quantifying uncertainty, enabling medical professionals to intervene for unreliable predictions. This is of utmost importance in critical applications such as medical diagnosis, where prediction accuracy and reliability can directly impact patient outcomes. The method is also robust to dataset changes, enabling application for medical centers with limited access to labeled data. Our findings highlight the proposed uncertainty estimation methodology’s potential to enhance automated segmentation robustness and generalizability, paving the way for more reliable and accurate LV volume estimation in clinical settings as well as opening new avenues for uncertainty quantification in biomedical image segmentation, providing promising directions for future research.},

It approximates a translationally invariant covariance kernel by complex exponentials on an equispaced Cartesian frequency grid of nodes. This results in a weight-space system matrix with Toeplitz structure, which can thus be applied to a vector in operations via the fast Fourier transform (FFT), independent of the number of data points . The linear system can be set up in operations using nonuniform FFTs. This enables efficient massive-scale regression via an iterative solver, even for kernels with fat-tailed spectral densities (large ). We provide bounds on both kernel approximation and posterior mean errors. Numerical experiments for squared-exponential and Matérn kernels in one, two, and three dimensions often show 1–2 orders of magnitude acceleration over state-of-the-art rank-structured solvers at comparable accuracy. Our method allows two-dimensional Matérn- regression from data points to be performed in two minutes on a standard desktop, with posterior mean accuracy .

  abstract     = {Abstract. Engineering and applied science rely on computational experiments to rigorously study physical systems. The mathematical models used to probe these systems are highly complex, and sampling-intensive studies often require prohibitively many simulations for acceptable accuracy. Surrogate models provide a means of circumventing the high computational expense of sampling such complex models. In particular, polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) have been successfully used for uncertainty quantification studies of deterministic models where the dominant source of uncertainty is parametric. We discuss an extension to conventional PCE surrogate modeling to enable surrogate construction for stochastic computational models that have intrinsic noise in addition to parametric uncertainty. We develop a PCE surrogate on a joint space of intrinsic and parametric uncertainty, enabled by Rosenblatt transformations, which are evaluated via kernel density estimation of the associated conditional cumulative distributions. Furthermore, we extend the construction to random field data via the Karhunen–Loève expansion. We then take advantage of closed-form solutions for computing PCE Sobol indices to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the model which quantifies the intrinsic noise contribution to the overall model output variance. Additionally, the resulting joint PCE is generative in the sense that it allows generating random realizations at any input parameter setting that are statistically approximately equivalent to realizations from the underlying stochastic model. The method is demonstrated on a chemical catalysis example model and a synthetic example controlled by a parameter that enables a switch from unimodal to bimodal response distributions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper focuses on the homogenization of high-contrast dielectric elastomer composites, which are materials that deform in response to electrical stimulation. The considered heterogeneous material, consisting of an ambient material with inserted particles, is described by a weakly coupled system of an electrostatic equation with an elastic equation enriched with electrostriction. It is assumed that particles gradually become rigid as the fine-scale parameter approaches zero. This study demonstrates that the effective response of this system entails a homogeneous dielectric elastomer, described by a system of PDEs whose equations are fully decoupled. The coefficients of the homogenized equations depend on various factors, including the geometry of the composite, the periodicity of the original microstructure, and the coefficients characterizing the initial heterogeneous material. In particular, these coefficients are significantly influenced by the high-contrast nature of the coefficients of the fine-scale problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a new model reduction technique for multiscale scalar transport problems that exhibit dominant axial dynamics. Toward this aim, we rely on the separation of variables to combine a hierarchical model (HiMod) reduction with a two-scale asymptotic expansion. We extend the two-scale asymptotic expansion to an arbitrary order and exploit the high-order correctors to define the HiMod modal basis which approximates the transverse dynamics of the flow, while we adopt a finite element discretization to model the leading stream. The resulting method, which is named HiPhom (high-order projection-based homogenization), is successfully assessed both in steady and unsteady advection-diffusion-reaction settings. The numerical results confirm the very good performance of HiPhom, which improves the accuracy and the convergence rate of HiMod and extends the reliability of the standard homogenized solution to transient and preasymptotic regimes.},

The derived moment closure systems are well defined for all physically relevant moments, and the resultant approximations of the distribution function converge as the number of moments goes to infinity. The convergence makes our method stand out from most existing moment methods. Moreover, we devise a delicate moment inversion algorithm. As an application, the Vicsek model is studied for overdamped active particles, and the Poisson-EQMOM is validated with a series of numerical tests including spatially homogeneous, one-dimensional, and two-dimensional problems.},

This paper studies the physical observables of continuum Schrödinger operators for incommensurate systems. We characterize the density of states and local density of states in real and reciprocal spaces, and develop novel numerical methods to approximate them. In particular, we (i) justify the thermodynamic limit of the density of states and local density of states via the operator kernel characterization; and (ii) propose efficient numerical schemes based on plane wave approximation and the trapezoidal rule in reciprocal space.

This analysis suggests that vibrational entropy can be effectively predicted using a surrogate model for site entropy. We employ machine learning to develop such a surrogate models employing the atomic cluster expansion model. We supplement our rigorous analysis with an empirical convergence study. In addition we demonstrate the performance of our method for predicting vibrational formation entropy and attempt frequency of the transition rates on point defects such as vacancies and interstitials.},

In the case of the KFE, a parabolic PDE in divergence form, we perform a matched asymptotic expansion up to first order in the small mean-reversion time. The solutions are expressed in terms of suitable PDEs with coefficients averaged over the ergodic distribution, in the spirit of extensive earlier work on the backward equation (see [J.-P. Fouque et al., Multiscale Stochastic Volatility for Equity, Interest Rate, and Credit Derivatives, Cambridge, University Press, 2011]). We then construct a sequence of approximations to the Zakai equation, a parabolic stochastic PDE (SPDE), and verify numerically for the first two terms weak convergence order half and order one, respectively, in the mean-reversion parameter. To this end, we give a novel numerical scheme for the original two-dimensional SPDE, which is robust in the small parameter regime, and compare derived functionals of marginals against those approximated by the solution of a sequence of homogenized one-dimensional SPDEs.},

The effective model is of micro-macro type and features strong nonlinear couplings. Here, we prove global existence in time and uniqueness for the effective micro-macro model under a smallness assumption for the data of the macroscopic elasticity subproblem. Moreover, we show numerically the convergence of microscopic solutions towards the solution of the effective model when the scale parameter becomes smaller and smaller, and also compute the approximation error. The numerical justification of the formally derived effective micro-macro model is particularly important, as rigorous analytical convergence proofs or error estimates are not available so far. Finally, we compare the effective micro-macro model with alternative, simpler effective descriptions of transport in elastic perforated media.},

The main idea is to first establish a local splitting of the solution over a local region by a local bubble part and local harmonic extension part, and then derive a global splitting by means of partition of unity. This facilitates a representation of the solution as a summation of a global bubble part and a global harmonic extension part, where the first part can be computed locally in parallel. To approximate the second part, we construct an edge multiscale ansatz space locally with hierarchical bases as the local boundary data that has a guaranteed approximation rate both inside and outside of the layers. The key innovation of this proposed WEMsFEM lies in a provable convergence rate with little restriction on the mesh size. Its convergence rate with respect to the computational degree of freedom is rigorously analyzed, which is verified by extensive 2-d and 3-d numerical tests.},

The high-order system turns out to be dispersive and exhibits solitary-wave formation, in close agreement with direct numerical simulations of the original system.

This paper proposes a novel collocation-type numerical stochastic homogenization method for prototypical stochastic homogenization problems with random coefficient fields of small correlation lengths. The presented method is based on a recently introduced localization technique that enforces a super-exponential decay of the basis functions relative to the underlying coarse mesh, resulting in considerable computational savings during the sampling phase. More generally, the collocation-type structure offers a particularly simple and computationally efficient construction in the stochastic setting with minimized communication between the patches where the basis functions of the method are computed. An error analysis that bridges numerical homogenization and the quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization is performed. In a series of numerical experiments, we study the effect of the correlation length and the discretization parameters on the approximation quality of the method.},

On a long time scale, the dynamics tend to a nonlinear diffusion-type equation called the Rosseland approximation. The main challenges for constructing numerical schemes that exhibit the correct limiting behavior are posed by the solution’s high-dimensional phase space and multiscale effects. In this work, we propose an asymptotic-preserving and rank-adaptive dynamical low-rank approximation scheme based on the macro-micro decomposition of the particle density and a modified augmented basis-update and Galerkin integrator. We show that this scheme, for linear particle emission by the material, dissipates energy over time under a step size restriction that captures the hyperbolic and parabolic CFL conditions.

Kothari, Efficient Simulation of Hamiltonians, M.S. thesis, University of Waterloo, 2010]), the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution is typically , which essentially states that one cannot go across the multiple scales as the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be strictly greater than the physical time. We demonstrated in the context of the semiclassical Schrödinger equation that the computational cost for a class of observables can be much lower than the state-of-the-art bounds. In the semiclassical regime (the effective Planck constant ), the operator norm of the Hamiltonian is . We show that the number of Trotter steps used for the observable evolution can be , that is, to simulate some observables of the Schrödinger equation on a quantum scale only takes the simulation time comparable to the classical scale. In terms of error analysis, we improve the additive observable error bounds in [C. Lasser and C. Lubich, Acta Numer., 29 (2020), pp. 229–401] to uniform-in- observable error bounds. This is, to our knowledge, the first uniform observable error bound for the semiclassical Schrödinger equation without sacrificing the convergence order of the numerical method. Based on semiclassical calculus and discrete microlocal analysis, our result showcases the potential improvements taking advantage of multiscale properties, such as the smallness of the effective Planck constant, and of the underlying dynamics, and sheds light on going across the scale for quantum dynamics simulation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is widely admitted in the heat transfer community that a steady laminar flow in a periodic channel becomes periodically developed after a small distance from the channel inlet. In this article, we provide a mathematical proof of this result for steady incompressible Stokes flows. Assuming the strip is a juxtaposition of periodic unit cells with a prescribed velocity at the inlet and a zero normal-stress boundary condition at the outlet, we prove that the velocity and pressure fields can be approximated up to exponentially small errors as by the sum of two terms: (i) a periodic velocity field driven by a constant pressure gradient propagating the input mass flow through the channel, and (ii) two boundary layer terms carrying zero mass and decaying exponentially away from the inlet and outlet boundaries. The periodically developed part of the flow can be computed by solving a periodic cell problem very similar to the one commonly encountered in periodic homogenization. The two boundary layer terms are the solutions to two Stokes problems posed in semi-infinite strips; they capture the transitory behavior between the inlet and outlet boundaries and the periodically developed region of the flow. We demonstrate the consistency of our mathematical result by numerical verifications on a number of two-dimensional flow geometries which showcase an excellent accuracy of the obtained asymptotic expansions. We complete our work by stating a homogenization result for a fluid flowing in a thin periodic strip of width with prescribed inlet and outlet boundary conditions. We obtain that the effective velocity and pressure fields are governed by Darcy’s law with a permeability constant predicted by classical periodic homogenization. Moreover, we identify the effective boundary conditions satisfied by the homogenized flow field, which are (i) a prescribed normal velocity at the inlet and (ii) a zero pressure boundary condition at the outlet.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a hyperbolic closure for the Grad moment expansion of the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) kinetic model using a neural network (NN) trained on BGK’s moment data. This closure is motivated by the exact closure for the free streaming limit that we derived in our paper on closures in transport [J. Huang et al., J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941]. The exact closure relates the gradient of the highest moment to the gradient of four lower moments. As with our past work, the model presented here learns the gradient of the highest moment in terms of the coefficients of gradients for all lower ones. By necessity, this means that the resulting hyperbolic system is not conservative in the highest moment. For stability, the output layers of the NN are designed to enforce hyperbolicity and Galilean invariance. This ensures the model can be run outside of the training window of the NN. Unlike our previous work on radiation transport that dealt with linear models, the BGK model’s nonlinearity demanded advanced training tools. These comprised an optimal learning rate discovery, one-cycle training, batch normalization in each neural layer, and the use of the AdamW optimizer. To address the nonconservative structure of the hyperbolic model, we adopt the FORCE numerical method to achieve robust solutions. This results in a comprehensive computing model combining learned closures with methods for solving hyperbolic models. The proposed model generalizes beyond the training time window for low to moderate Knudsen numbers. Our paper details the multiscale model construction and is run on a range of test problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the propagation of surface waves across structured surfaces with random, localized inhomogeneities. A discrete analogue of the Gurtin–Murdoch model is employed, and surface elasticity, in contrast to bulk elasticity, is captured by distinct point masses and elastic constants for nearest-neighbor interactions parallel to the surface. Expressions for the surface wave reflectance and transmittance, as well as the radiative loss, are provided for every localized patch of point mass perturbation on the surface. As the main result in the article, we provide the statistics of surface wave reflectance and transmittance and the radiative loss for an ensemble of random mass perturbations, independent and identically distributed with mean zero, on the surface. In the weakly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to be proportional to the size of the perturbed patch, to the variance of the mass perturbations, and to an effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum of the unperturbed system. In the strongly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to depend on another effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum, but not on the variance of the mass perturbations. Numerical simulations are found in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions for several illustrative values of the surface structure parameters.},

In Part II of our paper, we construct approximate space-time solutions with rigorous error control, which are used to obtain sharp stability estimates of the linearized operator in Part I. We also obtain sharp estimates of the velocity in the regular case using numerical integration with computer assistance. These results enable us to verify that the constants in the energy estimate obtained in Part I [Chen and Hou, preprint, arXiv:2210.07191, 2022] indeed satisfy the inequalities for nonlinear stability.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In biomechanics, local phenomena, such as tissue perfusion, are strictly related to the global features of the surrounding blood circulation. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous model where a local, accurate, three-dimensional (3D) description of tissue perfusion by means of fluid flows through deformable porous media equations is coupled with a systemic, 0D, lumped model of the remainder of the circulation, where the fluid flow through a vascular network is described via its analogy with a current flowing through an electric circuit. This represents a multiscale strategy, which couples an initial boundary value problem to be used in a specific tissue region with an initial value problem in the surrounding circulatory system. This PDE/ODE coupling leads to interface conditions enforcing the continuity of mass and the balance of stresses across models at different scales, and careful consideration is taken to address this interface mismatch. The resulting system involves PDEs of mixed type with interface conditions depending on nonlinear ODEs. A new result on local existence of solutions for this multiscale interface coupling is provided in this article.},

Using normal form transformations, we establish rigorously the existence of such solutions with oscillating tails (in the time domain) that can be made arbitrarily small but finite. Due to the presence of the oscillating tails, these solutions are coined generalized -gap breathers. Using a multiple-scale analysis, we also derive a tractable amplitude equation that describes the dynamics of breathers in the limit of small amplitude. In the presence of damping, we demonstrate the existence of transition fronts that connect the trivial state to the time-periodic ones.

We examine this comparison in the wider context of discretizing stochastic differential equations with and without the Lévy area. We study stochastic advection by Lie transport and its derivation from homogenization theory, which introduces drift corrections of the same class naturally. From a numerical viewpoint, we demonstrate that performing higher order discretizations with the use of a Lévy area can also lead to the loss of conserved area and angle quantities. Such behavior is not physically expected in the Stratonovich model. From the viewpoint of homogenization, the qualitative properties of the Wong–Zakai anomaly are physically motivated as arising due to correlations from a fast and mean scale fluid decomposition.},

Here we investigate the existence of families of symmetric periodic solutions as continuation of the elliptic orbits of the three-dimensional Kepler problem for certain symmetric differentiable perturbations using Delaunay coordinates. We consider spatial perturbations of the nonrotating and the rotating Kepler problem that are invariant with respect to some discrete reflection symmetries or have axial symmetry. More precisely, we characterize the sufficient conditions for their existence, and their type of stability is studied by estimating the characteristic multipliers of the symmetric periodic solutions. In addition, we present some results which establish a relation between symmetric periodic solutions obtained by the analytical continuation method and those obtained by the averaging method for 3-DOF Hamiltonian systems. Our study first takes into account that in each method it is necessary to find points from which the initial conditions that generating the families of periodic solutions bifurcate. By imposing a discrete symmetry on the average function, we can relate the previous points. Second, we show that the non-degeneracy condition for the application of the averaging method implies the non-degeneracy condition of the Poincaré continuation method. Finally, we compare the periods and characteristic multipliers of the family of periodic solutions obtained by each method. New families of periodic solutions for the generalized hydrogen atom in external electric and magnetic fields and for the hydrogen atom in van der Waals potential combined with a magnetic field are obtained as an application of our main results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper deals with the problem of simulating dense dispersed systems composed of large numbers of particles undergoing ballistic aggregation. The most classical approaches for dealing with such problems are represented by the so-called event-driven methods. Despite being more accurate, these methods become computationally very expensive as the number of particles increases. Typically, their computational cost is proportional to the square of the number of particles, and thus they become extremely demanding as soon as this number becomes sufficiently large. An alternative approach, called time stepping, consists in evolving the problem over small time intervals and handling all collisions occurring during each time interval simultaneously. In this work, we follow this second direction and introduce a new time stepping method which recasts the problem of the multiple collisions in a minimization framework. The objective of this work is twofold: The first goal is to show that the statistical description of the resulting aggregates obtained with this new time stepping method is sufficiently close to that of the event-driven methods. The second goal consists in showing that, in terms of computational performances, this new approach is competitive and may outperform standard methodologies, especially when the number of particles becomes sufficiently large. Numerical results obtained in the case of spherical particles moving in a two-dimensional box show that these two properties are indeed satisfied.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate an interacting particle model to simulate a foraging colony of ants, where each ant is represented as an active Brownian particle. The interactions among ants are mediated through chemotaxis, aligning their orientations with the upward gradient of the pheromone field. Unlike conventional models, our study introduces a parameter that enables the reproduction of two distinctive behaviors, the well-known Keller–Segel aggregation into spots and the formation of traveling clusters, without relying on external constraints such as food sources or nests. We consider the associated mean-field limit partial differential equation (PDE) of this system and establish the analytical and numerical foundations for understanding these particle behaviors. Remarkably, the mean-field PDE not only supports aggregation spots and lane formation but also unveils a bistable region where these two behaviors compete. The patterns associated with these phenomena are elucidated by the shape of the growing eigenfunctions derived from linear stability analysis. This study not only contributes to our understanding of complex ant colony dynamics but also introduces a novel parameter-dependent perspective on pattern formation in collective systems.},

We consider a class of birth/death like process corresponding to coupled biochemical reactions and consider the problem of quantifying the variance of the molecular species in terms of the rates of the reactions. In particular, we address this problem in a configuration where a species is formed with a rate that depends nonlinearly on another spontaneously formed species. By making use of an appropriately formulated expansion based on the Newton series, in conjunction with spectral properties of the master equation, we derive an analytical expression that provides a hard bound for the variance. We show that this bound is exact when the propensities are linear, with numerical simulations demonstrating that this bound is also very close to the actual variance. An analytical expression for the covariance of the species is also derived.},

We will assume the dynamical equations of the network are known, and that the dynamics are not necessarily low-dimensional. The case of linear dynamics is treated first and leads to a definition of observation error magnification factor (OEMF) that measures the magnification of noise in the reconstruction process. Subsequently, the definition is applied to nonlinear and chaotic dynamics. Comparison of OEMF for different target/observer combinations can lead to better understanding of how to optimally observe a network. As part of the study, a computational method for reconstructing time series from partial observations is presented and analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many important qualities of plasma confinement devices can be determined via the Poincaré plot of a symplectic return map. These qualities include the locations of periodic orbits, magnetic islands, and chaotic regions of phase space. However, every evaluation of the magnetic return map requires solving an ODE, meaning a detailed Poincaré plot can be expensive to create. Here, we propose a kernel-based method of learning a single labeling function that is approximately invariant under the symplectic map. From the labeling function, we can recover the locations of invariant circles, islands, and chaos with few evaluations of the underlying symplectic map. Additionally, the labeling function comes with a residual, which serves as a measure of how invariant the label function is and therefore as an indirect measure of chaos and map complexity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Control-based continuation (CBC) is a general and systematic method to explore the dynamic response of a physical system and perform bifurcation analysis directly during experimental tests. Although CBC has been successfully demonstrated on a wide range of systems, rigorous and general approaches to designing a noninvasive controller underpinning the methodology are still lacking. In this paper, a noninvasive adaptive control strategy for a wide class of nonlinear systems with unknown parameters is proposed. We prove that the proposed adaptive control methodology is such that the states of the dynamical system track a reference signal in a noninvasive manner if and only if the reference is a response of the uncontrolled system to an excitation force. Compared to the existing literature, the proposed method does not require any a priori knowledge of some system parameters, does not require a persistent excitation, and is not restricted to linearly stable systems, facilitating the application of CBC to a much larger class of systems than before. Rigorous mathematical analyses are provided, and the proposed control method is numerically demonstrated on a range of single- and multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear systems, including a Duffing oscillator with multiple static equilibria. It is especifically shown that the unstable periodic orbits of the uncontrolled systems can be stabilized and reached, noninvasively, in controlled conditions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Suppose one wants to monitor a domain with sensors, each sensing a small ball-shaped region, but the domain is hazardous enough that one cannot control the placement of the sensors. A prohibitively large number of randomly placed sensors could be required to obtain static coverage. Instead, one can use fewer sensors by providing mobile coverage, a generalization of the static setup wherein every possible evader is detected by the moving sensors in a bounded amount of time. Here, we use topology in order to implement algorithms certifying mobile coverage that use only local data to solve the global problem. Our algorithms do not require knowledge of the sensors’ locations, only their connectivity information. We experimentally study the statistics of mobile coverage in two dynamical scenarios. We allow the sensors to move independently (billiard dynamics and Brownian motion), or to locally coordinate their dynamics (collective animal motion models). Our detailed simulations show, for example, that collective motion can enhance performance: The expected time until the mobile sensor network achieves mobile coverage is lower for the D’Orsogna collective motion model than for the billiard motion model. Further, we show that even when the probability of static coverage is low, all possible evaders can nevertheless be detected relatively quickly by the mobile sensor network.},

We prove the existence of a family of traveling wave solutions in a variant of the Zeldovich–Frank-Kamenetskii (ZFK) equation, a reaction-diffusion equation which models the propagation of planar laminar premixed flames in combustion theory. Our results are valid in an asymptotic regime which corresponds to a reaction with high activation energy, and they provide a rigorous and geometrically informative counterpart to formal asymptotic results that have been obtained for similar problems using high activation energy asymptotics. We also go beyond the existing results by (i) proving smoothness of the minimum wave speed function , where is the small parameter, and (ii) providing an asymptotic series for a flat slow manifold which plays a role in the construction of traveling wave solutions for nonminimal wave speeds . The analysis is complicated by the presence of an exponential nonlinearity which leads to two different scaling regimes as , which we refer to herein as the convective-diffusive and diffusive-reactive zones. The main idea of the proof is to use the geometric blow-up method to identify and characterize a -family of heteroclinic orbits which traverse both of these regimes, and correspond to traveling waves in the original ZFK equation. More generally, our analysis contributes to a growing number of studies which demonstrate the utility of geometric blow-up approaches to the study of dynamical systems with singular exponential nonlinearities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a well-established method to generate a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for analysis and prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems. Recently, kernel EDMD (kEDMD) has gained popularity due to its ability to resolve the challenging task of choosing a suitable dictionary by using the kernel’s canonical features and, thus, data-informed observables. In this paper, we provide the first pointwise bounds on the approximation error of kEDMD. The main idea consists of two steps. First, we show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Wendland functions are invariant under the Koopman operator. Second, exploiting that the learning problem given by regression in the native norm can be recast as an interpolation problem, we prove our novel error bounds by using interpolation estimates. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we present a purely data-driven method that uses the Loewner framework along with nonlinear optimization techniques to infer quadratic dynamical systems with affine control that admit Volterra series (VS) representations from input-output time-domain measurements. The proposed method extensively employs optimization tools for interpolating the symmetric generalized frequency response functions (GFRFs) derived in the VS framework. The GFRF estimations are obtained from the Fourier spectrum (phase and amplitude) of the quasi-steady-state system response under harmonic excitation. Appropriate treatment of these measurements under the developed framework allows the identification of low-order in-state dimension quadratic state-space models with nontrivial stable equilibria, such as in the Lorenz ’63 forced system. We thus can achieve low-order global model identification for certain classes of systems that can bifurcate to multiple equilibria after collecting measurements solely from a local stable operational regime. The advanced framework rigorously tests the identification and reduction features across various examples with increasing dimensions and varying complexities. It effectively addresses the inference of a reduced model from measurements of a viscous flow, assuming adherence to the Burgers’ model with Robin boundary conditions. These results provide new prospects for developing low-order predictive models based on input-output data suitable for control.},

Here, we present a method for the projection-based model reduction of canonical Hamiltonian systems that is variationally consistent for any choice of linear reduced basis: Hamiltonian models project to Hamiltonian models. Applicable in both intrusive and nonintrusive settings, the proposed method is energy-conserving and symplectic, with error provably decomposable into a data projection term and a term measuring deviation from canonical form. Examples from linear elasticity with realistic material parameters are used to demonstrate the advantages of a variationally consistent approach, highlighting the steady convergence exhibited by consistent models where previous methods reliant on inconsistent techniques or specially designed bases exhibit unacceptably large errors.},

First, periodic orbits in the Circular Restricted 3-Body Problem (CR3BP) representation of the Earth-Moon (EM) system were identified. A Melnikov-type function was used to identify a set of candidate points on the EM CR3BP periodic orbits to start a continuation algorithm. A pseudo-arclength continuation scheme was then used to obtain the corresponding periodic orbit families in the HR4BP when including the effect of the Sun. Bifurcation points were identified in the computed families to obtain additional orbit families.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to a combination of noise and time-varying forcing can exhibit sudden changes, critical transitions, or tipping points, where large or rapid dynamic effects arise from changes in a parameter that are small or slow. Noise-induced tipping can occur where extremes of the forcing cause the system to leave one attractor and transition to another. We consider tipping in the presence of bounded chaotic forcing; previous work has primarily modelled noise forcing via a stochastic differential equation, but this is only a good model of chaotic forcing in the “fast chaos” limit. We argue that for low amplitude chaotic forcing close to a parameter value where there is a bifurcation of the unforced system, there will be a chaotic tipping window outside of which tipping cannot happen in the limit of asymptotically slow change of that parameter. This window is trivial for a stochastically forced system. Entry into the chaotic tipping window can be via a boundary crisis/nonautonomous saddle-node bifurcation and corresponds to an exceptional trajectory of the forcing, typically by an unstable periodic orbit. We discuss an illustrative example of a chaotically forced bistable map that highlights the richness of the geometry and bifurcation structure of the dynamics in this case. If there is also a ramping of a parameter we note there is a dynamic tipping window that can also be determined in terms of unstable periodic orbits.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When the planar circular restricted 3-body problem (PCRTBP) is periodically perturbed, as occurs in many useful astrodynamics models, most unstable periodic orbits persist as whiskered tori. Intersections between stable and unstable manifolds of such tori provide natural heteroclinic pathways, enabling spacecraft to greatly modify their orbits without using propellant. However, the 2D Poincaré sections used in PCRTBP studies no longer work to find these intersections. Thus, in this study, we develop new fast methods to search for and compute such heteroclinics. First, the dynamics are used to restrict the intersection search to only certain manifold subsets, greatly reducing the required computational effort. Next, we present a massively parallel procedure for carrying out this search by representing the manifolds as discrete meshes and adapting methods from computer graphics collision detection algorithms. Implementing the method in Julia and OpenCL, we obtain a 5–7x speedup by leveraging GPUs versus CPU-only execution. Finally, we show how to use manifold parameterizations to refine the approximate intersections found in the mesh search to very high accuracy, as well as to numerically continue the connections through families of tori; the families’ Whitney differentiability enables interpolation of needed parameterizations. The ability to very rapidly find a heteroclinic intersection between tori of fixed frequencies thus allows the systematic exploration of intersections for tori of nearby frequencies as well, yielding a variety of potential zero-fuel spacecraft trajectories. We demonstrate the tools on the Jupiter–Europa planar elliptic RTBP.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. While many well-established approaches exist for phase-based reduced order modeling of tonically firing neurons, comparatively few general approaches exist for the consideration of bursting neurons in a reduced order setting. Many formal analysis strategies exploit the separation of fast and slow timescales present in most bursting neurons, but these approaches are typically ill-suited to consider emergent behavior resulting from inter-neuron coupling or other external perturbations. This work considers the development and analysis of two different model order reduction approaches valid for two different topological classes of bursting neurons. For parabolic bursters, a persistent invariant circle allows for the relatively straightforward application of the extended phase reduction approach. For elliptic bursters, the perturbed dynamics can be considered relative to a carefully chosen set of reference trajectories. Mathematical analysis and accompanying numerical illustrations demonstrate the utility of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The cyclicity problem, crucial in analyzing planar vector fields, consists of estimating the number of limit cycles emanating from monodromic singularities. Traditionally, this estimation relies on Lyapunov coefficients. However, in nonsmooth systems, besides the limit cycles bifurcating by varying the Lyapunov coefficients, monodromic singularities on the switching curve can always be split apart, yielding, under suitable conditions, a sliding region and an additional limit cycle surrounding it. This bifurcation phenomenon, known as pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, has enhanced lower-bound cyclicity estimations for monodromic singularities in Filippov systems. In this study, we push beyond the pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, demonstrating that the destruction of -monodromic tangential singularities yields at least limit cycles surrounding sliding segments. This new bifurcation phenomenon expands our understanding of limit cycle bifurcations in nonsmooth systems and, in addition to the theoretical significance, has practical relevance in various applied models involving switches and abrupt processes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Oscillations of free intracellular calcium concentration are thought to be important in the control of a wide variety of physiological phenomena, and there is long-standing interest in understanding these oscillations via the investigation of suitable mathematical models. Many of these models have the feature that different variables or terms in the model evolve on very different time-scales, which often results in the accompanying oscillations being temporally complex. Cloete et al. [J. Theoret. Biol., 503 (2020), 110390] constructed an ordinary differential equation model of calcium oscillations in hepatocytes in an attempt to understand the origin of two distinct types of oscillation observed in experiments: narrow-spike oscillations, in which rapid spikes of calcium concentration alternate with relatively long periods of quiescence, and broad-spike oscillations, in which there is a fast rise in calcium levels followed by a slower decline, then a period of quiescence. These two types of oscillation can be observed in the model if a single system parameter is varied, but the mathematical mechanisms underlying the different types of oscillations were not explored in detail in [Cloete et al., J. Theoret. Biol., 503 (2020), 1103905]. We use ideas from geometric singular perturbation theory to investigate the origin of broad-spike solutions in this model. We find that the analysis is intractable in the full model, but are able to uncover structure in particular singular limits of a related model that point to the origin of the broad-spike solutions.},

Tracking is proved using a Lyapunov stability approach. When the phases of the training network are not clustered, then the adaptive strategy also guarantees convergence of the learning weights and frequencies to those of the training network. When the phases of the training network are clustered, the adaptive strategy achieve partial convergence of the learning weights and frequencies characterized by the type of clustering of the training network. The results are illustrated by 4-node training and learning networks with a variety of clustering configurations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A numerical investigation is undertaken into the existence and stability of localized patterned states of a two-species activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system posed on the real line. The specific system studied, originally proposed as a glycolisys model, was recently shown to feature a two-parameter bifurcation structure common to many Schnakenberg-like systems. This structure arises from a codimension-two point at which the fundamental pattern forming Turing bifurcation changes criticality. In this paper, we compute the rung states of a “snakes-and-ladders” bifurcation diagram. Owing to the nonvariational structure of reaction-diffusion systems, they represent traveling-wave solutions. Moreover, considering a parameter regime where the localized patterned solutions exist for a wide range of parameters, numerical evidence suggests a more complex topology of the bifurcation diagram reminiscent of, but different from, what has been described as foliated snaking. Finally, we investigate the emergence of branches of breather solutions, as the ratio of diffusion parameters is increased from small values. It is shown how these branches also inherit the snake structure which leads to multiplicity of stable localized breathers of arbitrary wide spatial extent. The results are argued to have wider implications for nonvariational pattern formation systems. In particular, the nascence of traveling and breather states is a first step in the onset for complex spatio-temporal localized structures with permanent dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Lambert problem originated in orbital mechanics. It is concerned with determining the initial velocity for a boundary value problem involving the dynamical constraint due to gravitational potential with additional time horizon and endpoint position constraints. Its solution has application in transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within a prescribed flight time via velocity control. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors is replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is a generalized SBP and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schrödinger factors, as we do in this work. Our analysis leads to solving a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate.},

These states are in correspondence with the explicit twisted states found in WSG and other highly symmetric networks, but in our situation there is no explicit formula due to the lack of symmetry. The method of proof is simple and robust. It allows other types of graphs like nn graphs or the boolean model and holds also for graphs defined in any simple closed curve or even a small neighborhood of the curve and for weighted graphs. It seems plausible that the method can be extended also to higher dimensions, but a more careful analysis is required.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motion polynomials (polynomials over the dual quaternions with nonzero real norm) describe rational motions. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for reduced bounded motion polynomials to admit factorizations into monic linear factors, and we give an algorithm to compute them. We can use those linear factors to construct mechanisms because the factorization corresponds to the decomposition of the rational motion into simple rotations or translations. Bounded motion polynomials always admit a factorization into linear factors after multiplying with a suitable real or quaternion polynomial. Our criterion for factorizability allows us to improve on earlier algorithms to compute a suitable real or quaternion polynomial co-factor.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is well known that the densest lattice sphere packings also typically have large kissing numbers. The sphere packing density maximization problem is known to have a solution among well-rounded lattices, of which the integer lattice is the simplest example. The integer lattice is also an example of a generic well-rounded lattice, i.e., a well-rounded lattice with a minimal kissing number. However, the integer lattice has the worst density among well-rounded lattices. In this paper, the problem of constructing explicit generic well-rounded lattices with dense sphere packings is considered. To this end, so-called tame lattices recently introduced by Damir and Mantilla-Soler are utilized. Tame lattices came to be as a generalization of the ring of integers of certain abelian number fields. The sublattices of tame lattices constructed in this paper are shown to always result in either a generic well-rounded lattice or the lattice , with density ranging between that of and . In order to find generic well-rounded lattices with densities beyond that of , explicit deformations of some known densest lattice packings are constructed, yielding a family of generic well-rounded lattices with densities arbitrarily close to the optimum. In addition to being an interesting mathematical problem in its own right, the constructions are also motivated from a more practical point of view. Namely, generic well-rounded lattices with high packing density make good candidates for lattice codes used in secure wireless communications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Identifying parameters in nonlinear dynamical systems, based solely on observational time series data, is of paramount importance to modeling, understanding, and predicting complex systems. While the adaptive synchronization technique has been successfully used for various identification tasks in the existing literature, its rigorousness hinges crucially on the prerequisite of the linear independence (LI) behaviors of the data converging to the limit set or attractor. This prerequisite is not always satisfied in real applications, since only the short-term data of transient dynamics produced by the systems under consideration is available. Here, to conquer this challenge, we introduce an iteratively adaptive framework designed to operate efficiently on short-term data of transient dynamics. We conduct theoretical analysis to demonstrate its rigorousness, and we offer a few representative examples from toy models to a real-world dataset to illustrate its practical usefulness and efficacy. In particular, an introduction of deliberately designed control or random perturbations renders the LI behaviors more attainable solely on transient dynamics. Consequently, successful identification of a substantial number of parameters in complex systems using short-term data becomes achievable, which significantly broadens the potential application scenarios of our work.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent clinical studies provide strong evidence that adaptive tumor therapy is a promising threshold policy-guided periodic and intermittent treatment for prolonging treatment efficacy particularly for prostate cancer, despite the observed tumor size fluctuations in the patients. Understanding plausible patterns of tumor size fluctuations under different treatment scenarios is important to evaluate the therapy outcomes. Here we use state-of-the-art modeling and analytic frameworks of periodic switching systems and state-dependent switching systems to develop a dynamic model that mimics the adaptive therapy, and we describe dynamical behaviors of the model system with a particular focus on the patterns of periodic fluctuation. Under the threshold policy, patients may not be given therapies during the a priori treatment period. We show that this threshold-guided treatment will give rise to a new type of periodic solutions with complex structures, characterized as -periodic solutions. We examine, both theoretically and numerically, the existence, as well as the local and global stability of such periodic solutions, including the boundary periodic solutions with one vanished compartment and positive -periodic solutions. It is hoped this study also shows the great potential in developing a class of models to describe threshold-triggered periodic and intermittent control in many fields, which in turn may generate many new dynamic behaviors of nonsmooth dynamic systems.},

With the increasingly available multifaceted data, a system can often be characterized across multiple spaces. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain coherence in the dynamics across these diverse spaces. To address this challenge, we introduce synchronized optimal transport (SyncOT), a novel approach to jointly model dynamics that represent the same system through multiple spaces. Given the correspondence between the spaces, SyncOT minimizes the aggregated cost of the dynamics induced across all considered spaces. The problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional convex problem using a staggered grid. Primal-dual algorithm-based approaches are then developed to solve the discretized problem. Various numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities and properties of SyncOT and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

In the former case, we derive a coupled Liouville system, revealing lower-order interactions among different Bloch bands. In the latter case, a coupled system of radiative transport equations emerges, with the scattering cross section induced by the random inhomogeneities.

Multi-species BGK models describe the dynamics of rarefied gases with constituent particles of different elements or compounds with potentially nontrivial velocity distributions. In this paper, moment equations for the bulk velocities, energies, and temperatures of a spatially homogeneous multi-species BGK model are examined. A key challenge in analyzing these equations is the fact that the collision frequencies are allowed to depend on the species temperatures, which allows for more realistic simulations of dilute gas flow. Therefore, a positive lower bound is established for the species temperatures. With this lower bound, a global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled velocity-energy ODE system is established. The lower bound also enables a proof of exponential decay to a unique steady-state solution. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate how the bulk velocities and temperatures relax for large times.},

Solving the stationary nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations is important in applications and examples include the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and the two-layer neural networks. Making use of the connection between the interacting particle systems and the nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations, we propose solving the stationary solution by sampling from the -body Gibbs distribution. This avoids simulation of the -body system for a long time and the requirement of uniform propagation of chaos from direct simulation of the particle systems. While the sampling strategy could be used for any given temperature, we establish the convergence of the Gibbs measure to the stationary solution when the interaction kernel is bounded (not necessarily continuous) and the temperature is high enough. Numerical experiments are performed for the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and the two-layer neural networks to validate the method and the theory.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recently, an algorithm was given in Garde and Hyvönen [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 56 (2024), pp. 3588–3604] for exact direct reconstruction of any perturbation from linearized data in the two-dimensional linearized Calderón problem. It was a simple forward substitution method based on a two-dimensional Zernike basis. We now consider the three-dimensional linearized Calderón problem in a ball and use a three-dimensional Zernike basis to obtain a method for exact direct reconstruction of any perturbation from linearized data. The method is likewise a forward substitution, hence making it very efficient to numerically implement. Moreover, the three-dimensional method only makes use of a relatively small subset of boundary measurements for exact reconstruction compared to a full basis of current densities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we study the influence of autotoxicity on vegetation patterns, by studying the existence and properties of traveling vegetation pulses. To that end, we consider an extension of the one-dimensional Klausmeier model that accounts for the toxicity compounds. Numerical simulations are first conducted to capture the qualitative behaviors of the pulse–type solutions and, then, geometric singular perturbation theory is used to prove the existence of such traveling pulses by constructing the corresponding homoclinic orbits in the associated four-dimensional system. A scaling analysis on the investigated model is performed to identify the asymptotic scaling regime in which traveling pulses can be constructed. Interestingly, due to the autotoxicity extension, the use of geometric blowup techniques can be avoided, in contrast with previous work [P. Carter and A. Doelman, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 78 (2023), pp. 3213–3237]. Some biological observations are extracted from the analytical results and the role of autotoxicity in traveling patterns is emphasized. Finally, the analytically constructed solutions are compared with the numerical ones, leading to a good agreement that confirms the validity of the conducted analysis. Numerical investigations are also carried out in order to gain additional information on vegetation dynamics.},

The problem of finding the fastest out of such events to occur is called an extreme first passage time. The rare event times are singular and limit to infinity as a positive parameter scaling the noise magnitude is reduced to zero. In contrast, previous work has shown that the mean of the fastest event time goes to zero in the limit of an infinite number of walkers. The combined limit is studied. In particular, the mean time and the most likely path taken by the fastest random walker are investigated. Using techniques from large deviation theory, it is shown that there is a distinguished limit where the mean time for the fastest walker can take any positive value, depending on a single proportionality constant. Furthermore, it is shown that the mean time and most likely path can be approximated using the solution to a variational problem related to the single-walker rare event.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many transport processes in ecology, physics, and biochemistry can be described by the average time to first find a site or exit a region, starting from an initial position. Typical mathematical treatments are based on formulations that allow for various diffusive forms and geometries but where only initial and final positions are taken into account. Here we develop a general theory for the mean first passage time (MFPT) for velocity jump processes. For random walkers, both position and velocity are tracked and the resulting Fokker–Planck equation takes the form of a kinetic transport equation. Starting from the forward and backward formulations we derive a general elliptic integro-PDE for the MFPT of a random walker starting at a given location with a given velocity. We focus on two scenarios that are relevant to biological modeling; the diffusive case and the anisotropic case. For the anisotropic case we also perform a parabolic scaling, leading to a well-known anisotropic MFPT equation. To illustrate the results we consider a two-dimensional circular domain under radial symmetry, where the MFPT equations can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, we consider the MFPT of a random walker in an ecological habitat that is perturbed by linear features, such as wolf movement in a forest habitat that is crossed by seismic lines.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The cancer microenvironment is increasingly being viewed as an ecosystem, in which tumor cells interact with surrounding cells through diverse ecological relationships. However, the ecological principles governing the dynamics of cancer development and progression remain a mystery, hindering efforts to develop better treatment strategies. Here, we propose a novel ecological network of “predation-mutualism-amensalism” among tumor cells, immune cells, and mutualist cells. We found that this ecological model can accurately recapitulate the dynamic states and their transitions during cancer immunoediting by integrating mathematical modeling, stability and bifurcation analysis, and validation using experiment data. In contrast, two current models that only described predation and amensalism interactions failed to achieve it, suggesting the essential contribution of mutualism to the evolution of cancer immunoediting. Further, the immune barrier as a quantitative index was exploited to investigate the interlinkages between ecological relationships and cancer progression. Surprisingly, we found that the mutualism-mediated and amensalism-mediated inhibition of antitumor immune response only affects the transition from dormancy to escape phase, while the predation-mediated antitumor immune response affects all the phase transition dynamics of cancer progression. Moreover, by constructing the solution landscape of cancer progression dynamics, we revealed that tumor cell migration enables cancer progression to enter the dormancy phase by evading immunosurveillance, while mutualist cell migration facilitates the tumor’s evasion from dormancy to escape phase. The discovery of these ecological principles and the understanding of cell motility within the cancer microenvironment provide a potential for improved intervention of ecological interactions that could impact cancer progression and treatment.},

In this article, we study the MacDonald Hamiltonian for twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and analyze the low-lying spectrum in TMDs in the limit of small twisting angles. Unlike in twisted bilayer graphene Hamiltonians, we show that TMDs do not exhibit flat bands. The flatness in TMDs for small twisting angles is due to spatial confinement by a matrix-valued potential. We show that by generalizing semiclassical techniques developed by Simon [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré, 38 (1983), pp. 295–307] and Helffer and Sjöstrand [Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 9 (1984), pp. 337–408] to matrix-valued potentials, there exists a wide range of model parameters such that the low-lying bands are of exponentially small width in the twisting angle, are topologically trivial, and obey a harmonic oscillator type of spacing with explicit parameters.},

In this paper, we initiate the study of matrix representations using the concept of noncommutative rank (nc-rank), which has recently attracted attention in the research of Edmonds’ problem. We reveal that the nc-rank of the matrix representation of linear matroid parity corresponds to the optimal value of fractional linear matroid parity: a half-integral relaxation of linear matroid parity. Based on our representation, we present an algebraic algorithm for the fractional linear matroid parity problem by building a new technique to incorporate the search-to-decision reduction into the half-integral problem represented via the nc-rank. We further present a faster divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding a maximum fractional matroid matching and an algebraic algorithm for finding a dual optimal solution. They together lead to an algebraic algorithm for the weighted fractional linear matroid parity problem. Our algorithms are significantly simpler and faster than the existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Given recording pairwise distances, the Metric Violation Distance problem asks to compute the distance between and the metric cone; i.e., modify the minimum number of entries of to make it a metric. Due to its large number of applications in various data analysis and optimization tasks, this problem has been actively studied recently. We present an -approximation algorithm for Metric Violation Distance, exponentially improving the previous best approximation ratio of of Fan, Raichel, and Van Buskirk [SODA, 2018]. Furthermore, a major strength of our algorithm is its simplicity and running time. We also study the related problem of Ultrametric Violation Distance, where the goal is to compute the distance to the cone of ultrametrics, and achieve a constant factor approximation algorithm. The Ultrametric Violation Distance problem can be regarded as an extension of the problem of fitting ultrametrics studied by Ailon and Charikar [SIAM J. Comput., 2011] and by Cohen-Addad, Das, Kipouridis, Parotsidis, and Thorup [FOCS, 2021] from norm to norm. We show that this problem can be favorably interpreted as an instance of Correlation Clustering with an additional hierarchical structure, which we solve using a new -approximation algorithm for correlation clustering that has the structural property that it outputs a refinement of the optimum clusters. An algorithm satisfying such a property can be considered of independent interest. We also provide an -approximation algorithm for a weighted version of Ultrametric Violation Distance. Finally, we investigate the complementary version of these problems where one aims at choosing a maximum number of entries of forming an (ultra)metric. In stark contrast to the minimization versions, we prove that these maximization versions are hard to approximate within any constant factor assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.},

In the -minor-free deletion problem we are given an undirected graph and the goal is to find a minimum vertex set that intersects all minor models of graphs from the family . This captures numerous important problems including Vertex cover, Feedback vertex set, Treewidth- modulator, and Vertex planarization. In the latter one, we ask for a minimum vertex set whose removal makes the graph planar. This is a special case of -minor-free deletion for the family . Whenever the family contains at least one planar graph, then -minor-free deletion is known to admit a constant-factor approximation algorithm and a polynomial kernelization [F. Fomin et al., Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, 2012, pp. 470–479]. A polynomial kernelization is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a graph and integer , outputs a graph on vertices and integer , so that if and only if . The Vertex planarization problem is arguably the simplest setting for which does not contain a planar graph and the existence of a constant-factor approximation or a polynomial kernelization remains a major open problem. In this work we show that Vertex planarization admits an algorithm which is a combination of both approaches. Namely, we present a polynomial -approximate kernelization, for some constant , based on the framework of lossy kernelization [D. Lokshtanov et al., Proceedings of the 49th Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, 2017, pp. 224–237]. Simply speaking, when given a graph and integer , we show how to compute a graph on vertices so that any -approximate solution to can be lifted to an -approximate solution to , as long as . In order to achieve this, we develop a toolkit for sparsification of planar graphs which approximately preserves all separators and near-separators between subsets of the given terminal set. Our result yields an improvement over the state-of-the-art approximation algorithms for Vertex planarization. The problem admits a polynomial-time -approximation algorithm, for any , and a quasi-polynomial-time -approximation algorithm, where is the input size, both randomized [K. Kawarabayashi and A.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of quantum feedback control in creating desired states for atomic and photonic systems utilizing a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this approach, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, and the photon can be reflected by either the terminal mirror of the waveguide or other atoms, establishing various feedback loops through the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are no more than two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be effectively elucidated through the lens of random graph theory. However, this process is influenced by the environment. We propose that the environment-induced dynamics in the coherent feedback loop can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Consequently, in the atom-waveguide interactions in open quantum systems, measurement-based feedback has the potential to modulate the quantum steady states. Additionally, the homodyne detection noise during the measurement process can induce errors upon quantum states, which can be influenced by the coherent feedback parameter designs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper considers a risk-sensitive optimal control problem for a field-mediated interconnection of a quantum plant with a coherent (measurement-free) quantum controller. The plant and the controller are multimode open quantum harmonic oscillators governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations, which are coupled to each other and driven by multichannel quantum Wiener processes modeling the external bosonic fields. The control objective is to internally stabilize the closed-loop system and minimize the infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rate of a quadratic-exponential functional which penalizes the plant variables and the controller output. We obtain first-order necessary conditions of optimality for this problem by computing the partial Fréchet derivatives of the cost functional with respect to the energy and coupling matrices of the controller in the frequency domain and state space. An infinitesimal equivalence between the risk-sensitive and weighted coherent quantum LQG control problems is also established. In addition to variational methods, we employ spectral factorizations and infinite cascades of auxiliary classical systems. Their truncations are applicable to numerical optimization algorithms (such as the gradient descent) for coherent quantum risk-sensitive feedback synthesis.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that a spectrum connected by conical intersections which do not pile up yields exact controllability in finite dimension and approximate controllability in infinite dimension. Actually, the property that intersections between eigenvalues are conical and that they do not pile up is generic. However, in physical situations, due to symmetry of the system, the spectrum can exhibit intersections that are not conical and possibly pile up. We extend the controllability result to cover these types of situations under the hypothesis that the intersections have at least one conical direction and the piled-up intersections have “rationally unrelated germs.” Finally, we provide a testable first-order sufficient condition for controllability. Physically relevant examples are provided.},

In addition, we prove boundedness in mean of the solutions of perturbed systems under open-loop protocols. For the feedback strategies, in the general case without assumptions on invariance, we provide bounds on the perturbation effect in expectation and in probability, as well as specific bounds for nondemolition nominal systems.},

The robust manipulation of ensembles of quantum systems exhibiting variations or uncertainties in the system parameters and dynamics has been a long-standing problem in the field of quantum control. Existing methods for addressing quantum ensemble control primarily rely on the use of state-space models that describe the time evolution of quantum states. In this paper, we introduce a distinctive quantum control paradigm by mapping the quantum ensemble control problem to a dual problem defined on a coordinate system established by a moment transform. This transformation introduces a new type of quantization in quantum systems, enabling tractable systems-theoretic analysis and effective optimal control design, which are typically opaque. Subsequently, we develop an iterative computational algorithm to solve the transformed optimal moment control problems. We conduct a convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness on various challenging pulse design problems in quantum control.},

In detail, we study when it is possible to control the dynamics of NLS as fast as desired via sufficiently large control signals and . We first show the existence of a family of quantum states for which this property is verified: this extends to the validity of a small-time control property recently shown on by the first author and Nersesyan, and on by Chambrion and the second author. Second, by considering some specific states belonging to this family, as a physical consequence we show the capability of controlling arbitrary changes of energy in bounded regions of the quantum system, in time zero. Our results are proved by exploiting the idea that the nonlinear term in NLS is only a perturbation of the linear problem when the time is as small as desired. The core of the proof, then, is the controllability of the bilinear equation which is tackled by using specific noncommutativity properties of infinite-dimensional propagators.},

In the present paper, we study its local exact controllability near the ground state in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions. To establish the controllability of the linearized equation, we use a bilinear control acting through four directions: three Fourier modes and one generic direction. The Fourier modes are appropriately chosen so that they satisfy a saturation property. These modes allow one to control approximately the linearzied Schrödinger equation. Then we show that the reachable set for the linearized equation is closed. This is achieved by representing the solution operator as a sum of two linear continuous mappings: one is surjective (here the control in generic direction is used) and the other is compact. A mapping with dense and closed image is surjective, so we conclude that the linearized Schrödinger equation is exactly controllable. The local exact controllability of the nonlinear equation then follows by the inverse mapping theorem.},

Under the assumption of affine invariance of the control family, we give a characterization of universal interpolation, showing that it holds for essentially any architecture with nonlinearity. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationship between universal interpolation and universal approximation in the context of general control systems, showing that the two properties cannot be deduced from each other. At the same time, we identify conditions on the control family and the target function that ensure the equivalence of the two notions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article focuses on a type of mean-field stochastic differential equation driven by G-Brownian motion (G-MFSDEs for short). We obtain the well-posedness of G-MFSDEs by truncating their space and distribution variables to obtain an Euler-like sequence, and then prove the Euler-like sequence to be a Cauchy sequence. G-Brownian motion and distribution dependence which is defined via the G-expectation prevent us from directly applying the stability analysis techniques developed for G-SDEs and MFSDEs to G-MFSDEs. To overcome these difficulties, we establish the G-Itô formula for G-MFSDEs, then, using this as our basis, we investigate the moment exponential stability and the global stability in probability of G-MFSDEs. We also stabilize an unstable G-MFSDE by adding a discrete-time state observation feedback control into the drift coefficient. Two examples are presented to check our theory results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper investigates asymptotic stabilization for heritable logical control networks (HLCNs). A pioneering method is proposed to deal with heritable hidden information, a stochastic temporal sequence that unavoidably exists in many practical controllers. To capture such information, a gated recurrent unit structure is introduced, in which the gate mechanism is modeled by a Markovian sampling process. Based on that, the semitensor product is applied to formulate the system as a switched LCN with a time-varying dimension. Then, the matrix expansion technique is employed to unify the dimension, and necessary and sufficient criteria for asymptotic stabilization are derived in two typical cases of the heritable hidden information. All of these criteria can be implemented using a newly proposed algorithm that is applicable to general cases. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical results.},

These equations can, for example, model the growth of an ecosystem under uncertainty. We first explore some fundamental properties of such linear SPDEs. Next, utilizing time-space white noise calculus, we derive both Pontryagin-type necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the control. Finally, we illustrate our results by solving a linear-quadratic control problem and examining an optimal harvesting problem in the plane.

Our results are based on the Koopman operator approach, and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution to an open problem within that framework. By focusing on the adjoint of the Koopman generator in the Hardy space on the polydisk (or on the real hypercube), we define equivalent linear (but infinite-dimensional) switched systems, and we construct a common Lyapunov functional for those systems, under a solvability condition of the Lie algebra generated by the linearized vector fields. A common Lyapunov function for the original switched nonlinear systems is derived from the Lyapunov functional by exploiting the reproducing kernel property of the Hardy space. The Lyapunov function is shown to converge in a bounded region of the state space, which proves global uniform stability of specific switched nonlinear systems on bounded invariant sets.},

At one end of the space interval, there is a reflecting boundary condition. At the other end a stabilizing feedback law with a varying time-delay is prescribed. We present sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the system. We show that exponential stabilization is possible if the product of the length of the interval and an upper bound for the source term is sufficiently small. We also show that if the product of the length of the interval and a lower bound for the source term is sufficiently large, the system is unstable. Our analysis is based on Lyapunov functions with weights that are given by hyperbolic functions that generalize the well-known exponential weights. Compared with previous contributions, we obtain conditions that can be verified more easily in terms of the system parameters. Our results show that for sufficiently short space intervals, and also with varying time-delay, exponential stabilization is possible with appropriately chosen feedback gains that depend on the maximal value of the time-delay and the maximal absolute value of its derivative.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Norm-optimal iterative learning control (NOILC) is effective for repetitive systems in achieving the monotonic decrease of the tracking error with respect to a specified trajectory. However, for classical NOILC, the model information is required, which contradicts the essential data-based characteristic for iterative learning control. Inspired by this contradiction, the current paper aims to establish a data-based design and analysis framework for NOILC, focusing on uncertain linear systems without system constraints. A Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based approach is leveraged to develop a virtual input-output relationship from only the collected system data, with which the design of NOILC can be accomplished without any model information. The monotonic convergence analysis of the proposed GPR-based NOILC is implemented such that the robust tracking task can be achieved in the presence of iteration-varying initial state shifts and disturbances, and the boundedness of all system trajectories can be ensured simultaneously. An example is also included to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the presented GPR-based NOILC methods.},

The conditions imposed imply that the time-varying vector field is almost periodic, so that in particular the time average of defines the time-homogeneous mean vector field , and the goal then is to find the root solving . The primary contribution on which other results are based is the perturbative mean flow representation: in which are identified as functionals of a state process. The representation is based on the application of techniques from Markov processes, for which Poisson’s equation plays a central role. This new representation, combined with new conditions for ultimate boundedness, has many applications for furthering the theory of QSA and its applications, including a proof that the estimation error is of order , but can be reduced to using a second order linear filter. Theory is illustrated using several examples, including applications to quasi-periodic linear systems and stochastic gradient descent.},

In this paper, we develop a space semidiscretized numerical scheme, rooted in the order reduction finite difference method, to uniformly and exponentially approximate the dynamics of an axially moving Euler–Bernoulli beam system under nonlinear boundary feedback control. This systematic approach encompasses the Euler–Bernoulli beam and wave equation under nonlinear boundary control as special cases. The feedback mechanism incorporates a nonlinear function that adheres to a sector condition, thus encompassing a diverse array of nonlinear feedback scenarios. The exponential stability and well-posedness of the continuous system are rigorously established through the application of integral inequality and nonlinear semigroup theory. Parallel to this, we demonstrate that the discrete systems, resulting from our numerical scheme, maintain uniform exponential stability with respect to the discrete step size. This conclusion is reached utilizing the discrete multiplier technique in conjunction with the integral inequality method, mirroring the analysis for the continuous counterpart.

Suppose that the signal-to-noise ratio (defined as the difference between the two possible drifts divided by the diffusion coefficient) is nonconstant. Given an initial state for the observed process, we consider a minimax formulation of the Wiener sequential testing problem for detecting the correct drift coefficient as soon as possible and with minimal probabilities of incorrect terminal decisions. We solve the problem in the Bayesian formulation, under any prior probabilities of the process having drift or , when the waiting time is penalized linearly. In the case where the signal-to-noise ratio is assumed constant, we obtain an explicit formula for the least favorable distribution.},

In this paper, we solve an open problem and obtain a general maximum principle for a stochastic optimal control problem where the control domain is an arbitrary nonempty set and all the coefficients (especially the diffusion term and the terminal cost) contain the control and state delay. In order to overcome the difficulty of dealing with the cross term of state and its delay in the variational inequality, we propose a new method: transform a delayed variational equation into a Volterra integral equation without delay inspired by [Y. Hamaguchi, Appl. Math. Optim., 87 (2023), 42], and introduce novel first-order, second-order adjoint equations via the backward stochastic Volterra integral equation theory established in [T. Wang and J. Yong, SIAM J. Control Optim., 61 (2023), pp. 3608–3634]. Finally we express these two kinds of adjoint equations in more compact anticipated backward stochastic differential equation types for several special yet typical control systems.},

Since in general the data may not determine the unknown BCN uniquely, such a problem cannot be approached by means of system identification combined with model-based analysis/control. Instead, we use the concept of informativity, which investigates the whole set of BCNs that explain the given data. An analysis/synthesis problem is then naturally solved for the unknown BCN if it is solved for all BCNs in this set. As such, we formulate necessary and sufficient conditions on the given data to be informative for a range of control analysis and synthesis problems. Also, explicit data-dependent formulas to compute control laws are given when the proposed informativity conditions are met. Examples are presented to show that, as expected, the obtained results are useful in situations where the measured data do not contain sufficient information to identify the unknown BCN.},

In this work, we study the mean field Schrödinger problem from a purely probabilistic point of view by exploiting its connection to stochastic control theory for McKean–Vlasov diffusions. Our motivation is to study scenarios in which mean field Schrödinger problems arise as the limit of “standard” Schrödinger problems over interacting particles. Due to the stochastic maximum principle and a suitable penalization procedure, the result follows as a consequence of novel (quantitative) propagation of chaos results for forward-backward particle systems. The approach described in the paper seems flexible enough to address other questions in the theory. For instance, our stochastic control technique further allows us to solve the mean field Schrödinger problem and characterize its solution, the mean field Schrödinger bridge, by a forward-backward planning equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Higher order necessary conditions for a minimizer of an optimal control problem—in particular, Goh and Legendre–Clebsch-type conditions—are generally obtained for systems whose dynamics is at least continuously differentiable in the state variable. Here, by making use of the notion of set-valued Lie bracket introduced in [F. Rampazzo and H. J. Sussmann, in Proceedings of the 40th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, Vol. 3, 2001, pp. 2613–2618] and extended in [E. Feleqi and F. Rampazzo, NoDEA Nonlinear Differential Equations Appl., 24 (2017), 61], we obtain Goh and Legendre–Clebsch-type conditions for a control affine system with locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics. In order to manage the simultaneous lack of smoothness of the adjoint equation and of the Lie bracket–like variations, we will exploit the notion of Quasi Differential Quotient, introduced in [M. Palladino and F. Rampazzo, [J. Differential Equations, 269 (2020), pp. 10107–10142]. We finally exhibit an example where the established higher order condition is capable of ruling out the optimality of a control verifying a first order Maximum Principle.},

When the coefficients are time-varying matrices, the existence of the solution to the mentioned control system is first proved and the solution can be represented by the Volterra integral where the properties of the kernel function are developed, and then the characterization of the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control under proper conditions is explored by maximum principle type necessary conditions. When the coefficients are constant matrices, the singular Volterra integral equation is reduced to the classical Caputo fractional system. In such cases, using the Mittag-Leffler matrix function and its properties, we show that if , the finiteness of the cost functional implies the initial value must be equal to zero, which results in there being no optimal control whence the initial value is not zero, while the cost functional must be finite if . Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control for is characterized, and based on this characterization, an additional interesting finding that the optimal control for linear quadratic optimal control of the fractional system cannot be obtained by linear feedback with a constant gain satisfying an algebraic Riccati equation is concluded.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we present an impulse response identification scheme that incorporates the internal positivity side-information of the system. The realization theory of positive systems establishes specific criteria for the existence of a positive realization for a given transfer function. These transfer function criteria are translated to a set of suitable conditions on the shape and structure of the impulse responses of positive systems. Utilizing these conditions, the impulse response estimation problem is formulated as a constrained optimization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space equipped with a stable kernel, and suitable constraints are imposed to encode the internal positivity side-information. The optimization problem is infinite-dimensional with an infinite number of constraints. An equivalent finite-dimensional convex optimization in the form of a convex quadratic program is derived. The resulting equivalent reformulation makes the proposed approach suitable for numerical simulation and practical implementation. A Monte Carlo numerical experiment evaluates the impact of incorporating the internal positivity side-information in the proposed identification scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using data from a heating system experiment.},

Each -by- matrix admits the CSR expansion that decomposes the matrix into a sum of at most periodic terms after times of powers. In this study, we propose an time algorithm for the CSR expansion, where is the number of nonzero entries in the matrix, which improves the algorithm known for this problem. Our algorithm is based on finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the max-plus matrix. These roots play a similar role to the eigenvalues of the matrix and become the growth rates of the terms in the CSR expansion.},

Since proportional allocations do not always exist when goods are indivisible, approximate concepts of proportionality have been considered in previous work. Among them, proportionality up to the maximin good (PROPm) has been the best approximate notion of proportionality that can be achieved for all instances [A. Baklanov et al., PROPm allocations of indivisible goods to multiple agents, in Proceedings of the 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021, pp. 24–30]. In this paper, we introduce the notion of proportionality up to the least valued good on average (PROPavg), which is a stronger notion than PROPm, and show that a PROPavg allocation always exists for all instances and can be computed in polynomial time. Our results establish PROPavg as a notable nontrivial fairness notion that can be achieved for all instances. Our proof is constructive and is based on a new technique that generalizes the cut-and-choose protocol and uses a recursive technique.},

Moreover, we exhibit an infinite family of obstructions that each induces a different asymptotic behavior for this extremal value.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Minimizing the weight of an edge set satisfying parity constraints is a challenging branch of combinatorial optimization as witnessed by the binary hypergraph chapter of Alexander Schrijver’s book [Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, 2003, Chapter 80]. This area contains relevant graph theory problems including open cases of the Max Cut problem and some multiflow problems. We clarify the interconnections between some of these problems and establish three levels of difficulty. On the one hand, we prove that the Shortest Odd Path problem in undirected graphs without cycles of negative total weight and several related problems are NP-hard, settling a long-standing open question asked by Lovász (Open Problem 27 in Schrijver’s book [Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, 2003]). On the other hand, we provide an algorithm for the closely related and well-studied Minimum-weight Odd -Join problem for nonnegative weights: our algorithm runs in FPT time parameterized by , where is the number of connected components in some efficiently computed minimum-weight -join. If negative weights are also allowed, then finding a minimum-weight odd -join is equivalent to the Minimum-weight Odd -Join problem for arbitrary weights, whose complexity is still only conjectured to be polynomially solvable. The analogous problems for digraphs are also considered.},

The set of all weighted subgraphs of a graph that have the same first eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) as is the intersection of a polyhedron with a cone of positive semidefinite matrices.

For a fixed graph , the -Recoloring problem asks whether, given two homomorphisms from a graph to , one homomorphism can be transformed into the other by changing the image of a single vertex in each step and maintaining a homomorphism to throughout. The most general algorithmic result for -Recoloring so far was proposed by Wrochna in 2014, who introduced a topological approach to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for any undirected loopless square-free graph . We show that the topological approach can be used to recover essentially all previous algorithmic results for -Recoloring and that it is applicable also in the more general setting of digraph homomorphisms. In particular, we show that -Recoloring admits a polynomial-time algorithm if (i) is a loopless digraph that does not contain a 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0 and (ii) is a reflexive digraph that contains no triangle of algebraic girth 1 and no 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0. In both cases, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for finding shortest transformations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. MAX NAE-SAT is a natural optimization problem, closely related to its better-known relative MAX SAT. The approximability status of MAX NAE-SAT is almost completely understood if all clauses have the same size for some . We refer to this problem as MAX NAE--SAT. For , it is a slight extension of the celebrated MAX CUT problem. For , it is related to the MAX CUT problem in graphs that can be fractionally covered by triangles. For , it is known that an approximation ratio of , obtained by choosing a random assignment, is optimal, assuming . For every , an approximation ratio of at least can be obtained for MAX NAE--SAT. There was some hope, therefore, that there is also a -approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, where clauses of all sizes are allowed simultaneously. Our main result is that there is no -approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). In fact, even for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE--SAT (i.e., MAX NAE-SAT where all clauses have size 3 or 5), the best approximation ratio that can be achieved, assuming UGC, is at most . Using calculus of variations, we extend the analysis of O’Donnell and Wu for MAX CUT to MAX NAE--SAT. We obtain an optimal algorithm, assuming UGC, for MAX NAE--SAT, slightly improving on previous algorithms. The approximation ratio of the new algorithm is about 0.9089. This gives a full understanding of MAX NAE--SAT for every . Interestingly, the rounding function used by this optimal algorithm is the solution of an integral equation. We complement our theoretical results with some experimental results. We describe an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE--SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8728, and an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE-SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8698. We further conjecture that these are essentially the best approximation ratios that can be achieved for these problems, assuming the UGC. Somewhat surprisingly, the rounding functions used by these approximation algorithms are nonmonotone step functions that assume only the values .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the following variant of the edge-augmentation problem: Given a -edge-connected graph with no loops or multiple edges, find a smallest edge set in the complement whose addition to results in a -edge-connected graph. We establish the following dichotomy for this problem: If the complement of contains a matching covering all vertices of -degree (and possibly more), then the complement also contains a matching whose addition to results in a -edge-connected graph. A smallest matching which augments the minimum degree can be found, in polynomial time, by Edmonds’ matching algorithm, but it need not augment the edge-connectivity. Indeed, it is NP-hard to find a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting edge set, by a result of Tibor Jordán. On the other hand, if the complement of contains no matching covering all vertices of -degree , then the complement has a minimum degree augmenting path system consisting of paths of length 1 or 2. Again we can find such a path system with as few edges as possible by Edmonds’ matching algorithm. We can, in polynomial time, modify it to an edge-connectivity augmenting path system of paths of length 1 or 2 with the same number of edges, and this time it yields a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting set of edges. Combining these results, we conclude that a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting edge set in the complement of a -regular, -edge-connected simple graph has size , where is the number of vertices of , and is the size of a maximum matching in the complement of . Another corollary is that the complement of every simple noncomplete graph with vertices has a set of at most edges whose addition to results in a graph of larger edge-connectivity, with equality holding if and only the complement of is a disjoint union of 3-cycles.},

Their primary tool, a bijection called compression that converts certain -ribbon tilings to -ribbon tilings, allowed them to reduce their problems to the enumeration of dimers (i.e., perfect matchings) of certain graphs. We present a generalized version of compression that no longer relies on the perspective of partitions and skew shapes. Using this strengthened tool, we resolve three more of Propp’s conjectures and recast several others as problems about perfect matchings.},

More precisely, for vertices and of , and an integer , they gave FPT algorithms parameterized by deciding whether there is an -path in whose vertex set contains a subset of elements of of rank . These algorithms are based on the Schwartz–Zippel lemma for polynomial identity testing and thus are randomized, and therefore the existence of a deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem remains open. We present the first deterministic FPT algorithm that solves the problem in frameworks whose underlying graph is planar. While the running time of our algorithm is worse than the running times of the recent randomized algorithms, our algorithm works on more general classes of matroids. In particular, this is the first FPT algorithm for the case when matroid is represented over rationals. We complement this result by proving that if the input matroids are given by their independence oracles, then there is no algorithm solving the problem with oracle queries. Furthermore, this computational lower bound holds even if the input graphs are planar graphs of treewidth at most two.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the classical cake cutting problem where we wish to fairly divide a heterogeneous resource among interested agents. Work on this subject typically assumes that the cake is represented by an interval. We introduce a generalized setting where the cake is represented by an arbitrary undirected graph, which allows us to model the division of road networks. Unlike in the interval setting, common fairness criteria such as proportionality cannot always be satisfied in graphical cake cutting if each agent must receive a connected subgraph. We determine the optimal approximation of proportionality that can be obtained for any number of agents with additive valuations, and exhibit a tight guarantee for each graph in the case of two agents. We also study several variants and extensions, including when more than one connected piece per agent is allowed as well as when the item to be divided is undesirable.},

As soon as a finite-dimensional set of possible yield curves is chosen, one likes to estimate the dynamic behavior of the yield curve evolution from data. The estimated model should be free of arbitrage which is known to result in some drift condition. If the yield curve evolution is modelled by a diffusion, then this leaves the diffusion coefficient open for estimation. From a practical perspective, this requires that the chosen set of possible yield curves is compatible with any obtained diffusion coefficient. In this paper, we show that this compatibility enforces an affine geometry of the set of possible yield curves.},

We apply a unified singular control framework where irreversible reinsurance contracts can be signed in both discrete and continuous times. The results theoretically illustrate that, rather than continuous-time contracts or a bunch of discrete-time contracts, a single once-for-all reinsurance contract is preferred. Moreover, the Stackelberg game turns out to be centering on the signing time of the single contract. The insurer signs the contract if the premium rate is lower than a time-dependent threshold and the reinsurer designs a premium that triggers the signing of the contract at his preferred time. Further, we find that reinsurance preference, discount, and reversion have a decreasing dominance in the reinsurer’s decision-making, which is not seen for the insurer.},

At the mathematical level, this leads to a natural decomposition of the infinitesimal generator describing the evolution of the limit order book into two operators: the generator of the order flow and a clearing operator. This decomposition provides a flexible and modular framework for modeling and simulating order book dynamics and studying various scaling limits of discrete order book models. We show that our framework includes previous models as special cases and yields insights into the interplay between order flow and price dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Time inconsistency (TIC) often arises in multiperiod decision-making through the encoding of more realistic human preferences as objectives; TIC describes a situation in which a plan, consisting of current and future actions, that is optimal today may no longer be optimal in the future. The subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) solution is well-known to resolve such TIC, backed by evidence from behavioral economics and stochastic control literature. Motivated by TIC proliferation and SPE desirability in handling TIC, this paper establishes a subgame perfect equilibrium reinforcement learning (SPERL) framework to search for an SPE solution for TIC problems. We propose a new class of algorithms, called extended backward policy iteration (EBPI), that solves SPERL and concurrently addresses two algorithmic challenges in TIC-RL: the nonexistence of natural recursive relationships between value functions at different time points and the questionable applicability of standard policy iteration algorithms due to unprovable policy improvement theorems. To demonstrate the practical usage of EBPI as a training framework, we adopt standard RL sample-based methods and derive two EBPI-based training algorithms. We examine our derived training frameworks on a mean-variance portfolio selection problem and evaluate some performance metrics including convergence and model identifiability.},

In addition to the usual setting considered in mathematical finance, we also consider an investor who is informed about the risky asset’s price changes with a delay. When the stock increments are independent, identically distributed, and follow a normal distribution, we compute explicitly the value of the problem and the corresponding optimal hedging strategy in a discrete- and a continuous-time setting. In discrete time, our approach is based on duality theory and tools from linear algebra which are related to banded matrices and Toeplitz matrices. Next, we study an analogous continuous-time model where it is possible to trade at fixed equally spaced times. In this model, we compute the scaling limit for both the trading strategy and the achieved value as the frequency of the trading events increases. Finally, we prove that this scaling limit coincides with the continuous-time hedging problem.},

Two prominent algorithms in this area are Plug-and-Play (PnP) and Regularization-by-Denoising (RED). We consider two specific algorithms, PnP-FISTA and RED-APG, where regularization is performed by replacing the proximal operator in the FISTA algorithm with a powerful denoiser. The iterate convergence of FISTA is known to be challenging with no universal guarantees. Yet, we show that for linear inverse problems and a class of linear denoisers, global linear convergence of the iterates of PnP-FISTA and RED-APG can be established through simple spectral analysis.},

Previous Retinex-based methods simultaneously estimate illumination and reflectance, complicating model design and potentially impacting image enhancement due to flawed prior assumptions. In this paper, we explore the physical basis of low-light image enhancement, focusing on contrast, saturation, and brightness, and propose an adaptive contrast-saturation (ConSat) model. Our ConSat innovation simplifies model design by focusing solely on a brightness enhancement function, allowing for precise image brightness control while keeping colors natural and realistic. We design a new saturation metric that assesses pixel dispersion from the mean of RGB channels, accurately depicting exposure variations across the image. On this basis, we propose a smart contrast stretching function that adapts contrast adjustments to enhance images under varying light. It boosts contrast in dark, low-saturation areas to clarify details and textures, while curbing it in bright, high-saturation areas to prevent overexposure and color distortion. Finally, we employ a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoiser to achieve satisfactory visual appeal. Numerical experiments show that our ConSat is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in brightness improvement, noise removal, and artifact elimination.},

The proposed method is particularly effective in solving classes of variational problems, specifically monotone inclusion problems, commonly encountered in image processing tasks. The forward-backward-forward (FBF) algorithm is employed to address these problems, offering a solution even when the Lipschitz constant of the NN is unknown. Notably, the FBF algorithm provides convergence guarantees under the condition that the learned operator is monotone. Building on plug-and-play methodologies, our objective is to apply these newly learned operators to solving nonlinear inverse problems. To achieve this, we initially formulate the problem as a variational inclusion problem. Subsequently, we train a monotone NN to approximate an operator that may not inherently be monotone. Leveraging the FBF algorithm, we then show simulation examples where the nonlinear inverse problem is successfully solved.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Homogeneous diffusion inpainting can reconstruct missing image areas with high quality from a sparse subset of known pixels, provided that their location as well as their gray or color values are well optimized. This property is exploited in inpainting-based image compression, which is a promising alternative to classical transform-based codecs such as JPEG and JPEG2000. However, optimizing the inpainting data is a challenging task. Current approaches are either fairly slow or do not produce high quality results. As a remedy we propose fast spatial and tonal optimization algorithms for homogeneous diffusion inpainting that efficiently utilize GPU parallelism, with a careful adaptation of some of the most successful numerical concepts. We propose a densification strategy using ideas from error-map dithering combined with a Delaunay triangulation for the spatial optimization. For the tonal optimization we design a domain decomposition solver that solves the corresponding normal equations in a matrix-free fashion and supplement it with a Voronoi-based initialization strategy. With our proposed methods we are able to generate high quality inpainting masks for homogeneous diffusion and optimized tonal values in a runtime that outperforms prior state-of-the-art by a wide margin.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multilayer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC) is a powerful technique for obtaining parsimonious representations of signals in machine learning applications. However, achieving maximum parsimony without sacrificing data fidelity requires learning a dictionary from data, resulting in the nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem of multilayer convolutional dictionary learning (ML-CDL). Existing ML-CDL solvers derived from traditional dictionary learning employ the convex function as the sparsity-inducing function to promote convergence; nevertheless, analyzing the convergence of candidate alternate optimization schemes is still challenging. In this paper, we reformulate the ML-CDL problem by replacing the convolution with the Hadamard product to reduce computational complexity, and to achieve this without destroying the consistency between the variables in the time and frequency domains, additional constraints are introduced to the reformulated problem. We also modify a forward-backward splitting algorithm to solve the reformulated ML-CDL problem using simultaneous coefficients and dictionary element updates across all layers. In contrast, these variables are updated alternately in the previous approaches. The proposed algorithm includes a parameter adaptation scheme to improve optimization performance and ensure convergence. In numerical simulations, the proposed method outperforms existing methods by achieving convergence in fewer iterations and generating a smaller final functional value. The high quality of recovered images demonstrates the applicability of multilayer sparse representation to image reconstruction.},

Finding a transformation between two unknown probability distributions from finite samples is crucial for modeling complex data distributions and performing tasks such as sample generation, domain adaptation, and statistical inference. One powerful framework for such transformations is normalizing flow, which transforms an unknown distribution into a standard normal distribution using an invertible network. In this paper, we introduce a novel model called SyMOT-Flow, which trains an invertible transformation by minimizing the symmetric maximum mean discrepancy between samples from two unknown distributions, and an optimal transport cost is incorporated as regularization to obtain a short-distance and interpretable transformation. The resulting transformation leads to more stable and accurate sample generation. Several theoretical results are established for the proposed model, and its effectiveness is validated with illustrative low-dimensional examples as well as high-dimensional bimodality medical image generation through the forward and reverse flows.},

We propose a novel model for decomposing grayscale images into three distinct components: the structural part, representing sharp boundaries and regions with strong light-to-dark transitions; the smooth part, capturing soft shadows and shades; and the oscillatory part, characterizing textures and noise. To capture the homogeneous structures, we introduce a combination of -gradient and curvature regularization on level lines. This new regularization term enforces strong sparsity on the image gradient while reducing the undesirable staircase effects as well as preserving the geometry of contours. For the smoothly varying component, we utilize the -norm of the Laplacian that favors isotropic smoothness. To capture the oscillation, we use the inverse Sobolev seminorm. To solve the associated minimization problem, we design an efficient operator-splitting algorithm. Our algorithm effectively addresses the challenging nonconvex nonsmooth problem by separating it into subproblems. Each subproblem can be solved either directly using closed-form solutions or efficiently using the fast Fourier transform. We provide systematic experiments, including ablation and comparison studies, to analyze our model’s behaviors and demonstrate its effectiveness as well as efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Interactive segmentation allows users to provide meaningful input to guide the segmentation process. However, an important problem in interactive segmentation lies in determining how to incorporate minimal yet meaningful user guidance into the segmentation model. In this paper, we propose the quasi-conformal interactive segmentation (QIS) model, which incorporates user input in the form of positive and negative clicks. Users mark a few pixels belonging to the object region as positive clicks, indicating that the segmentation model should include a region around these clicks. Conversely, negative clicks are provided on pixels belonging to the background, instructing the model to exclude the region near these clicks from the segmentation mask. By solving our proposed theoretical supported model, the segmentation mask is obtained by deforming a template mask with the same topology as the object of interest using a quasi-conformal mapping. This approach makes each user input effectively used and helps to avoid topological errors in the segmentation results. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed model for its ability to include or exclude regions of interest or disinterest based on the user’s indication. To evaluate the performance of QIS, we conduct experiments on synthesized images, medical images, and natural images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.},

Our new theoretical results provide convergence guarantees of the direct extension of ADMM (E-ADMM) without Lipschitz continuity of the gradient and Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property, and establish the worst-case convergence rate in the nonergodic sense. Under further conditions such as Lipschitz continuity and nonsingularity, we derive the global linear rate of convergence.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce two quasi-Newton forward-backward splitting algorithms to solve a class of monotone inclusion problems. The bottleneck is the evaluation of the resolvent operator. Changing the metric makes its computation even harder, and this is even true for a simple operator whose resolvent is known for the standard metric. To fully exploit the advantage of adapting the metric, we develop a new efficient resolvent calculus for a low-rank perturbed standard metric, which accounts exactly for quasi-Newton metrics. Moreover, we prove the convergence of our algorithms, including linear convergence rates in case one of the two considered operators is strongly monotone. As a by-product of our general monotone inclusion framework, we introduce two variants of the quasi-Newton primal-dual hybrid gradient method (PDHG) for solving saddle point problems. The favorable performance of these two quasi-Newton PDHG methods is demonstrated on several numerical experiments in image processing.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we address the problem of registering multiple point clouds corrupted with high anisotropic localization noise. Our approach follows the widely used framework of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) reconstruction with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Existing methods are based on an implicit assumption of spatially invariant isotropic Gaussian noise. However, this assumption is violated in practice in applications such as single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). To address this issue, we propose to introduce an explicit localization noise model that decouples shape modeling with the GMM from noise handling. We use this model for multiview point cloud registration by designing an EM algorithm that considers noise-free data as a latent variable, with closed-form solutions at each EM step. The first advantage of our approach is to handle spatially varying and anisotropic Gaussian noise. The second advantage is to leverage the explicit noise model to impose prior knowledge about the noise that may be available from physical sensors. We show on various simulated data that our noise handling strategy improves significantly the robustness to high levels of anisotropic noise. We also demonstrate the performance of our method on real SMLM data.},

Multispectral images contain light information in different wavelengths of objects, which convey spectral-spatial information and help improve the performance of various image processing tasks. Numerous techniques have been developed to extend the application of total variation regularization in restoring multispectral images, for example, based on channel coupling and adaptive total variation regularization. The primary contribution of this paper is to propose and develop a new multispectral total variation regularization in a generalized opponent transformation domain instead of the original multispectral image domain. Here, opponent transformations for multispectral images are generalized from a well-known opponent transformation for color images. We will explore the properties of generalized opponent transformation total variation (GOTTV) regularization and the corresponding optimization method for multispectral image restoration. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed GOTTV method, we provide numerical examples that showcase its superior performance compared to existing multispectral image total variation methods, using criteria such as mean peak signal-to-noise ratio and mean structural similarity index.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Blind image deblurring is one of the most critical issues in digital image processing. The main goal of blind image deblurring is to estimate the blur kernel and the intermediate image with a blurry image as input. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for blind image deblurring based on the image smoothing priors. We notice that the salient edge is significant in estimating the blur kernel. If we can find a strategy that can preserve the salient edges of images and smooth out unnecessary details in the deblurring process, the estimated blur kernel will be more accurate. According to this observation, we draw on the experience of image smoothing and propose a new model based on the smoothing priors. For binary images, we extend our model by considering binary constraints. We also extend our method to the nonuniform deblurring problem. Numerically, we use the half-quadratic splitting method to minimize the optimization problem. We also propose a new template-based interpolated algorithm to solve the minimization problem. In the experiment part, we test our method on various datasets to show its effectiveness. Compared with other related methods, our method can estimate blur kernels more accurately and generate fewer artifacts.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recently, the problem of one-bit tensor completion (1BTC) has garnered increasing attention and has been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally. However, prior works heavily relied on the precise knowledge on the distribution of the dither (i.e., the noise prior to one-bit quantization), which is not applicable to applications that involve unknown prequantization noise. The main goal of this paper is to address this limitation and develop a 1BTC method robust to both noise and corruption. Within the framework of tensor SVD, we demonstrate the robustness by studying the following two settings: (i) 1BTC under sub-Gaussian noises, and (ii) a more challenging scenario where sparse corruptions (besides sub-Gaussian noise) also are present. Built upon a novel usage of an -loss function in 1BTC, we propose regularized Lasso for the first setting and a constrained Lasso for the second setting, and both recovery programs are accompanied by theoretical recovery guarantees. We establish nearly matching minimax lower bounds for both settings with unquantized observations, which demonstrates that our recovery methods are near-optimal and the proposed quantization scheme only induces minor information loss. Moreover, we propose optimization algorithms and conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to validate our theory and the robustness of our method.},

Motivated by a class of nonlinear imaging inverse problems, for instance, multispectral computed tomography (MSCT), this paper studies the convergence theory of the nonlinear Kaczmarz method (NKM) for solving the system of nonlinear equations with componentwise convex mapping, namely, the function corresponding to each equation being convex. Such kind of nonlinear mapping may not satisfy the commonly used componentwise tangential cone condition (TCC). For this purpose, we propose a novel condition named relative gradient discrepancy condition (RGDC) and make use of it to prove the convergence and even the convergence rate of the NKM with several general index selection strategies, where these strategies include the cyclic strategy and the maximum residual strategy. Particularly, we investigate the application of the NKM for solving nonlinear systems in MSCT image reconstruction. We prove that the nonlinear mappings in this context fulfill the proposed RGDC rather than the componentwise TCC and provide a global convergence of the NKM based on the previously obtained results. Numerical experiments further illustrate the numerical convergence of the NKM for MSCT image reconstruction.},

Our general estimation framework is based on the minimization of the quadratic risk, which is approximated in two steps, and adapts to photon and electronic noises. Relying on an unbiased risk estimate (URE) for the first step and on “internal adaptation,” a concept borrowed from deep learning theory, for the second, we show that our approach enables one to reinterpret and reconcile previous state-of-the-art nonlocal methods. Within this framework, we propose a novel denoiser called NL-Ridge that exploits linear combinations of patches. While conceptually simpler, we show that NL-Ridge can outperform well-established state-of-the-art single-image denoisers.},

Further interest stems from their possible application as an endogenous signal source that can be utilized for brain imaging in general. The (pulse-)wave describing the blood flow velocity along an intracranial artery consists of a forward (anterograde) and a backward (retrograde, reflected) part, but measurements of this wave usually consist of a superposition of these components. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for the inverse problem of estimating the pulse wave velocity, as well as the forward and backward components of the pulse wave separately from MRI measurements on intracranial arteries. After a mathematical analysis of this problem, we consider possible reconstruction approaches and derive an alternate direction approach for its solution. The resulting methods provide estimates for anterograde/retrograde wave forms and the pulse wave velocity under specified assumptions on a cerebrovascular model system. Numerical experiments on simulated and experimental data demonstrate the applicability and preliminary in vivo feasibility of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we study the subspace clustering and recovery of multidimensional images. Existing matrix-based/tensor-based subspace clustering methods successfully consider unilateral information (i.e., the similarity between image samples) to cluster samples into subspaces by using low-rank representation. The key issue of the unilateral representation-based methods is that the number of samples in each subspace should be sufficient for subspace representation. In practice, the clustering performance can be degraded when there is only a small number of observed samples in each subspace. To address the problem of insufficient observed samples, we propose to introduce hidden tensor data to supplement an insufficient number of observed samples. We employ both observed samples and hidden tensor data under low-rank constraints so that a new bilateral tensor low-rank representation (BTLRR) in subspace clustering is formulated. We show that a closed-form solution of block-diagonal tensor structure is obtained in subspace clustering of observed samples and hidden tensor data. Also the proposed BTLRR optimization problem can be solved by using the convex relaxation technique and augmented Lagrangian multiplier algorithm. The proposed BTLRR can fully explore the bilateral information of observations, including not only the similarity between samples but also the relationship among features. Extensive numerical results on multidimensional image data clustering and recovery illustrate that the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed bilateral representation are better than those of state-of-the-art methods (e.g., the popular LRR and TLRR methods).},

This flow happens to be the gradient flow in the usual Wasserstein space of the squared sliced-Wasserstein distance to the target. We consider the question whether in long-time the flow converges to the target (providing a positive result when the target is Gaussian) and the question of the long-time limit of the flow map obtained by following the trajectories of each particle. We prove that this limit is, in general, not the optimal transport map from the starting measure to the target.

We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and nonconservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in two dimensions is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in one dimension. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in two dimensions is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we investigate the nonlinear stability of the viscous contact wave for the isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations with a free boundary. It is shown that, when time tends to infinity, the fluid part of solutions will asymptotically converge to the viscous contact waves, and more importantly, the magnetic field will converge to a nontrivial wave pattern. This wave phenomenon is different from those of isentropic compressible Navier–Stokes equations, which means the magnetic field truly makes an essential effect on the fluid behavior. The main result is proved by using elaborate wave pattern analysis and elementary energy methods, provided the initial perturbations and wave strength are suitably small.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the Cauchy problem for the 3D incompressible axisymmetric swirl-free Euler equations. The convex integration method developed by De Lellis and Székelyhidi rules out the possibility that the Euler equations admit unique admissible weak solutions. It had remained conceivable, though, that axisymmetry of the solution might serve as a selection criterion. Using a surprising link to 2D isentropic compressible Euler equations, we will show that this is not the case: There exists initial data for which there are infinitely many admissible swirl-free axisymmetric weak solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. Moreover, somewhat conversely, we show that there exists an axisymmetric swirl-free initial velocity for which the axisymmetry breaks down instantaneously.},

We prove that the same asymptotics hold for complex mKdV. The major difficulty in the complex case is that the nonlinearity cannot be expressed as a derivative, which makes the low-frequency dynamics harder to control. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce the decomposition , where is a self-similar solution with the same mean as and is a remainder that has better decay. By using the explicit expression for , we are able to get better low-frequency behavior for than we could from dispersive estimates alone. An advantage of our method is its robustness: It does not depend on the precise algebraic structure of the equation, and as such can be more readily adapted to other contexts.},

A long-standing area in materials science is to study the concentration phenomenon of electrostatic, magnetic, and elastic fields in composites with densely packed inclusions whose material properties differ from that of the background. In the context of linear elasticity, if the Lamé parameters of inclusions are of high contrast with those of the matrix, the stress generally blows up in the narrow region between closely located inclusions. The contributions and novelties of this present paper are twofold: (i) We establish pointwise second-order derivative estimates for the solutions to the Lamé system with partially infinite coefficients, modeling hard and strictly convex inclusions in dimensions two and three, which will build a bridge between PDE analysis and numerical computation. (ii) Precise asymptotic characterizations of the gradient are obtained, which capture all the singularities of different orders and improve our earlier results on the upper and lower bound estimates. Additionally, the asymptotic expressions of each element of the strain tensor are derived. We show that some of them may blow up with different rates, while some of them are bounded.},

We show that the distribution function converges to a regular distribution function along modifications to the characteristics of the linearized problem. We define the linearly growing corrections to the characteristic system in terms of a precise effective asymptotic force field. We make use of the scattering state to obtain the late-time asymptotic behavior of the spatial density. Finally, we prove that the distribution function (up to normalization) converges weakly to a Dirac mass on the unstable manifold of the origin.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose and study the utilization of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map to uniquely identify the discount functions and cost function in a stationary mean field game (MFG) system. This study features several technical novelties that make it highly intriguing and challenging. First, it involves a coupling of two nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. Second, the simultaneous recovery of multiple parameters poses a significant implementation challenge. Third, there is the probability measure constraint of the coupled equations to consider. Finally, the limited information available from partial boundary measurements adds another layer of complexity to the problem. Considering these challenges and problems, we present an enhanced higher-order linearization method to tackle the inverse problem related to the MFG system. Our proposed approach involves linearizing around a pair of zero solutions and fulfilling the probability measurement constraint by adjusting the positive input at the boundary. It is worth emphasizing that this technique is not only applicable for uniquely identifying multiple parameters using full-boundary measurements but also highly effective for utilizing partial-boundary measurements.

This new system of PDEs is an extension of the Monge–Ampère equation in dimensions, naturally arising from the prescribed curvature problem and closely related to the classical problem of the isometric immersions (II). Our main result achieves density in the set of subsolutions, of the Hölder solutions to the Von Kármán system (VK) which is the weak formulation of (MA). The regularity exponent is any exponent satisfying , where is an arbitrary dimension and an arbitrary codimension of the problem. At , this agrees with flexibility up to for (II) with proved by Conti and Szekelyhidi in [Sci. China Math., 62 (2019), pp. 1041–1056]. At , this extends the initial findings by the author and Pakzad in [Anal. PDE, 10 (2017), pp. 695–727] for (MA). Our result covers the codimension interval so far uncharted even for the system (II), since the regularity with any achieved by Källen in [Ark.

This paper primarily focuses on investigating the well-posedness of the solution to the pressure problem of the Navier–Stokes–Fourier system with temperature-dependent transport coefficients. It is important to highlight that the negativity of pressure is not a requirement in our study. Our findings reveal that the behavior of the solution at infinite time is solely determined by the value of , leading to three distinct situations: , or . We specifically focused on investigating the first two situations and gained comprehensive insights into their large time behavior. Furthermore, through the construction of a special solution, we discover that the variation of the parameter “” in the viscosity coefficient , when given , also exerts an influence on the large time behavior of the solution, particularly on the temperature . These results can be viewed as an extension of Takeyuki Nagasawa’s seminal work from around 1988.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We show that the problem of finding the barycenter in the Hellinger–Kantorovich setting admits a least-cost soft multimarginal formulation, provided that a one-sided hard marginal constraint is introduced. The constrained approach is then shown to admit a conic multimarginal reformulation based on defining a single joint multimarginal perspective cost function in the conic multimarginal formulation, as opposed to separate two-marginal perspective cost functions for each two-marginal problem in the coupled-two-marginal formulation, as was studied previously in the literature. We further establish that, as in the Wasserstein metric, the recently introduced framework of unbalanced multimarginal optimal transport can be reformulated using the notion of the least cost. Subsequently, we discuss an example when input measures are Dirac masses and numerically solve an example for Gaussian measures. Finally, we also explore why the constrained approach can be seen as a natural extension of a Wasserstein space barycenter to the unbalanced setting.},

It can also reveal hidden structure, especially when the Volterra equation extends to a complex domain. Our main result is to show that for a certain kind of regular singular Volterra equation on a complex domain, there is always a unique solution of a certain form.

This facilitates tracing the origins of environmental pollutants. Employing the concept of dynamic complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions, a variational formulation of the inverse source problem is analyzed, leading to a proof of uniqueness result. Our proposed two-step reconstruction algorithm first determines the point source locations and subsequently reconstructs the Fourier components of the emission concentration functions. Numerical experiments on simulated data are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed two-step reconstruction algorithm can reliably reconstruct multiple point sources and accurately reconstruct the emission concentration functions. Additionally, by partitioning the algorithm into online and offline computations, and concentrating computational demand offline, real-time pollutant traceability becomes feasible. This method, applicable in various fields, especially those related to water pollution, can identify the source of a contaminant in the environment, thus serving as a valuable tool in environmental protection.},

Results are formulated in terms of a family of generalized principal eigenvalues associated with the linearized problem. When the maximal generalized principal eigenvalue is negative, all solutions to the Cauchy problem become locally uniformly positive in long time, at least one space-time periodic uniformly positive entire solution exists, and solutions with compactly supported initial condition asymptotically spread in space at a speed given by a Freidlin–Gärtner-type formula. When another, possibly smaller generalized principal eigenvalue is nonnegative, then, on the contrary, all solutions to the Cauchy problem vanish uniformly, and the zero solution is the unique space-time periodic nonnegative entire solution. When the two generalized principal eigenvalues differ and zero is in between, the long-time behavior depends on the decay at infinity of the initial condition. The proofs rely on double-sided controls by solutions of cooperative systems. The control from below is new for such systems and makes it possible to shorten the proofs and extend the generality of the system simultaneously.},

Similarly to the work of Bresch and Desjardins in compressible fluid mechanics, we identify the presence of an effective velocity in the system, linking the velocity field of the fluid and the gradient of a suitable function of the density. By use of this effective velocity, we propose a new formulation of the original system of equations, thus highlighting a strong similarity with the equations of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics. By taking advantage of the new formulation of the equations, we establish a local-in-time well-posedness theory in Besov spaces based on and prove a lower bound for the lifespan of the solutions implying “asymptotically global” existence: In the regime of small initial density variations, for small , the corresponding solution is defined up to some time satisfying the property when .},

In this paper we consider two diffuse interface models for tumor growth coupling a Cahn–Hilliard type equation for the tumor phase parameter to a reaction-diffusion type equation for the nutrient. The models are distinguished by the presence of two different coupling source terms. For such problems, we address the question of the limit, as the diffuse interface parameter tends to zero, from diffuse interface models to sharp interface ones, justifying rigorously what was deduced via formal asymptotics in [H. Garcke, K. F. Lam, E. Sitka, and V. Styles, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 26 (2016), pp. 1095–1148]. The resulting evolutions turn out to be varifold solutions to Mullins–Sekerka type flows for the tumor region suitably coupled with the equation for the nutrient.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study a semidiscrete model for the two-dimensional incompressible porous medium equation describing the gravitational fingering phenomenon. The model consists of a system of advection-reaction-diffusion equations on concentration, velocity, and pressure, describing the motion of miscible liquids under Darcy’s law in two vertical tubes (real lines) and interflow between them. Our analysis reveals the structure of gravitational fingers in this simple setting — the mixing zone consists of space-time regions of constant intermediate concentrations and the profile of propagation is characterized by two consecutive traveling waves which we call a terrace. We prove the existence of such a propagating terrace for the parameters corresponding to small distances between the tubes. This solution shows the possible mechanism of slowing down the fingers’ growth due to convection in the transverse direction. The main tool in the proof is a reduction to pressure-free transverse flow equilibrium model using geometrical singular perturbation theory and the persistence of stable and unstable manifolds under small perturbations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Paterson–Stockmeyer method is an evaluation scheme for matrix polynomials with scalar coefficients that arise in many state-of-the-art algorithms based on polynomial or rational approximation, for example, those for computing transcendental matrix functions. We derive a mixed-precision version of the Paterson–Stockmeyer method that is particularly useful for evaluating matrix polynomials with scalar coefficients of decaying magnitude. The new method is mainly of interest in the arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and it is attractive for high-precision computations. The key idea is to perform computations on data of small magnitude in low precision, and rounding error analysis is provided for the use of precisions lower than the working precision. We focus on the evaluation of the Taylor approximants of the matrix exponential and show the applicability of our method to the existing scaling and squaring algorithms. We also demonstrate through experiments the general applicability of our method to other problems, such as computing the polynomials from the Padé approximant of the matrix exponential and the Taylor approximant of the matrix cosine. Numerical experiments show our mixed-precision Paterson–Stockmeyer algorithms can be more efficient than its fixed-precision counterpart while delivering the same level of accuracy.

The CUR decomposition approximates a matrix using a subset of columns and rows of the matrix. When the number of columns and rows is the same, the CUR decomposition can become unstable and less accurate due to the presence of the matrix inverse in the core matrix. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the CUR decomposition can be implemented in a numerically stable manner and illustrate that oversampling, which increases the number of either columns or rows in the CUR decomposition, can enhance its accuracy and stability. Additionally, this work devises an algorithm for oversampling motivated by the theory of the CUR decomposition and the cosine-sine decomposition, whose competitiveness is illustrated through experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Methods and algorithms that work with data on nonlinear manifolds are collectively summarized under the term “Riemannian computing.&quot; In practice, curvature can be a key limiting factor for the performance of Riemannian computing methods. Yet curvature can also be a powerful tool in the theoretical analysis of Riemannian algorithms. In this work, we investigate the sectional curvature of the Stiefel and Grassmann manifold. On the Grassmannian, tight curvature bounds have been known since the late 1960s. On the Stiefel manifold under the canonical metric, it was believed that the sectional curvature does not exceed 5/4. Under the Euclidean metric, the maximum was conjectured to be at 1. For both manifolds, the sectional curvature is given by the Frobenius norm of certain structured commutator brackets of skew-symmetric matrices. We provide refined inequalities for such terms and pay special attention to the maximizers of the curvature bounds. In this way, we prove for the Stiefel manifold that the global bounds of 5/4 (canonical metric) and 1 (Euclidean metric) hold indeed. With this addition, a complete account of the curvature bounds in all admissible dimensions is obtained. We observe that “high curvature means low-rank&quot;; more precisely, for the Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds under the canonical metric, the global curvature maximum is attained at tangent plane sections that are spanned by rank-two matrices, while the extreme curvature cases of the Euclidean Stiefel manifold occur for rank-one matrices.

Then we generalize this approach to the block and normalization lagging variants and prove the same order of accuracy.

As such, this method augments an unprojected Krylov subspace. Furthermore, it combines randomized sketching and deflated restarting in a way that avoids orthogononalizing a full Krylov basis. We call this new method GMRES-SDR (sketched deflated restarting). With this new method, we provide new theory which initially characterizes unaugmented sketched GMRES as a projection method for which the projectors involve the sketching operator. We demonstrate that sketched GMRES and its sibling method sketched FOM are an MR/OR pairing, just like GMRES and FOM. We furthermore obtain residual convergence estimates. Building on this, we characterize GMRES-SDR also in terms of sketching-based projectors. Compression of the augmented Krylov subspace for recycling is performed using a sketched version of harmonic Ritz vectors. We present results of numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of GMRES-SDR over competitor methods such as GMRES-DR and GCRO-DR.},

We show that one must be extremely careful when discretizing nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Using examples from the NLEVP collection, we demonstrate that discretization can lead to several issues, including (1) introduction of spurious eigenvalues, (2) omission of spectra, (3) severe ill-conditioning, and (4) emergence of ghost essential spectra. While many eigensolvers are available for solving finite matrix nonlinear eigenvalue problems, we propose InfBeyn, a solver for general holomorphic infinite-dimensional nonlinear eigenvalue problems that circumvents these discretization issues. We prove that InfBeyn is stable and converges. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm that computes the problem’s pseudospectra with explicit error control, enabling verification of computed spectra.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new projected Rayleigh quotient iteration aimed at improving the convergence behavior of classic Rayleigh quotient iteration (RQI) by incorporating approximate information about the target eigenvector at each step. While classic RQI exhibits local cubic convergence for Hermitian matrices, its global behavior can be unpredictable, whereby it may converge to an eigenvalue far away from the target, even when started with accurate initial conditions. This problem is exacerbated when the eigenvalues are closely spaced. The key idea of the new algorithm is at each step to add a complex-valued projection to the original matrix (that depends on the current eigenvector approximation), such that the unwanted eigenvalues are lifted into the complex plane while the target stays close to the real line, thereby increasing the spacing between the target eigenvalue and the rest of the spectrum. Making better use of the eigenvector approximation leads to more robust convergence behavior, and the new method converges reliably to the correct target eigenpair for a significantly wider range of initial vectors than does classic RQI. We prove that the method converges locally cubically, and we present several numerical examples demonstrating the improved global convergence behavior. In particular, we apply it to compute eigenvalues in a band-gap spectrum of a Sturm–Liouville operator used to model photonic crystal fibers, where the target and unwanted eigenvalues are closely spaced. The examples show that the new method converges to the desired eigenpair even when the eigenvalue spacing is very small, often succeeding when classic RQI fails.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) is a technique in data analysis and machine learning that approximates a symmetric matrix with a product of a nonnegative, low-rank matrix and its transpose. To design faster and more scalable algorithms for SymNMF, we develop two randomized algorithms for its computation. The first algorithm uses randomized matrix sketching to compute an initial low-rank approximation to the input matrix and proceeds to rapidly compute a SymNMF of the approximation. The second algorithm uses randomized leverage score sampling to approximately solve constrained least squares problems. Many successful methods for SymNMF rely on (approximately) solving sequences of constrained least squares problems. We prove theoretically that leverage score sampling can approximately solve nonnegative least squares problems to a chosen accuracy with high probability. Additionally, we prove sampling complexity results for previously proposed hybrid sampling techniques which deterministically include high leverage score rows. This hybrid scheme is crucial for obtaining speedups in practice. Finally, we demonstrate that both methods work well in practice by applying them to graph clustering tasks on large real world data sets. These experiments show that our methods approximately maintain solution quality and achieve significant speedups for both large dense and large sparse problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem (GOPP) plays a fundamental role in several scientific disciplines including statistics, imaging science, and computer vision. Despite its tremendous practical importance, it is generally an NP-hard problem to find the least squares estimator. We study the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and an iterative method named generalized power method (GPM) to find the least squares estimator, and we investigate the performance under a signal-plus-noise model. We show that the SDR recovers the least squares estimator exactly, and moreover, the generalized power method with a proper initialization converges linearly to the global minimizer to the SDR, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is large. The main technique follows from showing the nonlinear mapping involved in the GPM is essentially a local contraction mapping, and then applying the well-known Banach fixed-point theorem finishes the proof. In addition, we analyze the low-rank factorization algorithm and show the corresponding optimization landscape is free of spurious local minimizers under nearly identical conditions that enable the success of the SDR approach. The highlight of our work is that the theoretical guarantees are purely algebraic and do not assume any statistical priors of the additive adversaries, and thus it applies to various interesting settings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The fast multipole method (FMM) is a powerful method for accelerating some kernel matrix-vector multiplications. In this paper, we show an intuitive matrix version of the FMM in two dimensions via degenerate Taylor series expansions and, furthermore, give a simple stabilization strategy to balance relevant low-rank factors so that the factors and some translation operators satisfy certain norm bounds. Based on these, we provide the long-overdue backward stability analysis for the FMM. The matrix version FMM translates the original FMM terminology into simple matrix language with the aim of being more accessible to nonexperts and more convenient to perform backward stability analysis. The stabilization strategy leads to entrywise backward errors that depend only logarithmically on the matrix size, which shows the superior stability benefit of the FMM on top of its efficiency advantage as compared with usual dense matrix-vector multiplications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we develop a novel multilevel Tau matrix-based preconditioned method for a class of nonsymmetric multilevel Toeplitz systems. This method not only accounts for but also improves upon an ideal preconditioner pioneered by Pestana [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 40 (2019), pp. 870–887]. The ideal preconditioning approach was primarily examined numerically in that study, and an effective implementation was not included. To address these issues, we first rigorously show in this study that this ideal preconditioner can indeed achieve optimal convergence when employing the minimal residual (MINRES) method, with a convergence rate that is independent of the mesh size. Then, building on this preconditioner, we develop a practical and optimal preconditioned MINRES method. To further illustrate its applicability and develop a fast implementation strategy, we consider solving Riemann–Liouville fractional diffusion equations as an application. Specifically, following standard discretization on the equation, the resultant linear system is a nonsymmetric multilevel Toeplitz system, affirming the applicability of our preconditioning method. Through a simple symmetrization strategy, we transform the original linear system into a symmetric multilevel Hankel system. Subsequently, we propose a symmetric positive definite multilevel Tau preconditioner for the symmetrized system, which can be efficiently implemented using discrete sine transforms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that mesh-independent convergence can be achieved. In particular, we prove that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are bounded within disjoint intervals containing , without any outliers. Numerical examples are provided to critically discuss the results, showcase the spectral distribution, and support the efficacy of our preconditioning strategy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Johnson–Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction in modern algorithm design. The lemma states that any set of high-dimensional points in a Euclidean space can be projected into lower dimensions while approximately preserving pairwise Euclidean distances. Random matrices satisfying this lemma are called JL transforms (JLTs). Inspired by existing -hashing JLTs with exactly nonzero elements on each column, the present work introduces an ensemble of sparse matrices encompassing so-called -hashing-like matrices whose expected number of nonzero elements on each column is . The independence of the sub-Gaussian entries of these matrices and the knowledge of their exact distribution play an important role in their analyses. Using properties of independent sub-Gaussian random variables, these matrices are demonstrated to be JLTs, and their smallest nontrivial singular values and largest singular values are estimated nonasymptotically using a technique from geometric functional analysis. As the dimensions of the matrix grow to infinity, these singular values are proved to converge almost surely to fixed quantities (by using the universal Bai–Yin law) and in distribution to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble Tracy–Widom law after proper rescalings. Understanding the behaviors of extreme singular values is important in general because they are often used to define a measure of stability of matrix algorithms. For example, JLTs were recently used in derivative-free optimization algorithmic frameworks to select random subspaces in which are constructed random models or poll directions to achieve scalability, and hence estimating their smallest singular value in particular helps determine the dimension of these subspaces.},

One of their main features is their high degree of parallelism that makes them extremely effective for high performance computing. One of their main drawbacks, however, is that the set-up cost grows very quickly with the density, so that it is practically impossible to increase their accuracy by just allowing more entries. In this work, we consider approximate inverses in factored form and show that nesting more factors can greatly enhance their effectiveness at a reasonable computational cost. We additionally provide strategies and theoretical insights aimed at mitigating the computational burden associated with the triple matrix product required in the initial stage of nesting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments arising from a broad spectrum of real-world applications.},

We provide novel theoretical evidence, supported by extensive experimental evaluation, that with high probability, the smallest singular value of a stochastically rounded matrix is well bounded away from zero—regardless of how close is to being rank-deficient and even if is rank-deficient. In other words, stochastic rounding implicitly regularizes tall-and-thin matrices so that the rounded version has full column rank.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Block classical Gram–Schmidt (BCGS) is commonly used for orthogonalizing a set of vectors in distributed computing environments due to its favorable communication properties relative to other orthogonalization approaches, such as modified Gram–Schmidt or Householder. However, it is known that BCGS (as well as recently developed low-synchronization variants of BCGS) can suffer from a significant loss of orthogonality in finite-precision arithmetic, which can contribute to instability and inaccurate solutions in downstream applications such as -step Krylov subspace methods. A common solution to improve the orthogonality among the vectors is reorthogonalization. Focusing on the “Pythagorean” variant of BCGS, introduced in [E. Carson, K. Lund, and M. Rozložník, SIAM J.

These variants feature favorable communication properties, with asymptotically two synchronization points per block column, as well as an improved bound on the loss of orthogonality. Our bounds are derived in a general fashion to additionally allow for the analysis of mixed-precision variants.

Theoretical results and extensive numerical experiments suggest that H-CMRH exhibits comparable performance to the established hybrid GMRES method in terms of stabilizing semiconvergence, but H-CMRH does not require any inner products, and requires less work and storage per iteration.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The recent decade has witnessed a surge of research in modelling and computing from two-way data (matrices) to multiway data (tensors). However, there is a drastic phase transition for most tensor computation problems when the order of a tensor increases from two to three: Most tensor problems are NP-hard while those for matrices are easy. It triggers a question on where exactly the transition occurs. The paper aims to study the kind of question for the spectral norm and the nuclear norm. Although computing the spectral norm for a general tensor is NP-hard, we show that it can be computed using a number of arithmetic operations which is polynomial in and if is fixed. In other words, the best rank-one approximation of a general tensor can be computed in polynomial time for fixed . Under an assumption of a polynomial-time algorithm for quadratic feasibility problem in the bit complexity, both the spectral norm and the nuclear norm of a general tensor can be computed in polynomial time in the bit complexity for fixed . While these polynomial-time methods are not currently implementable in practice, we propose fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for the spectral norm based on polytope approximation and for the nuclear norm with further help of duality theory and semidefinite optimization. Numerical experiments show that our FPTAS can compute these tensor norms for small but large and . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to compute the nuclear norm of general asymmetric tensors. Both polynomial-time algorithms and FPTAS can be extended to higher-order tensors as well.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for approximating multivariate traces, i.e., the traces of matrix products. Our research is motivated by the extensive utility of multivariate traces in elucidating spectral characteristics of matrices, as well as by recent advancements in leveraging quantum computing for faster numerical linear algebra. Central to our approach is a direct translation of a multivariate trace formula into a quantum circuit, achieved through a sequence of low-level circuit construction operations. To facilitate this translation, we introduce quantum matrix states linear algebra (qMSLA), a framework tailored for the efficient generation of state preparation circuits via primitive matrix algebra operations. Our algorithm relies on sets of state preparation circuits for input matrices as its primary inputs and yields two state preparation circuits encoding the multivariate trace as output. These circuits are constructed utilizing qMSLA operations, which enact the aforementioned multivariate trace formula. We emphasize that our algorithm’s inputs consist solely of state preparation circuits, eschewing harder to synthesize constructs such as block encodings. Furthermore, our approach operates independently of the availability of specialized hardware like QRAM, underscoring its versatility and practicality.},

First of all, we show that this problem is equivalent to a special rank-1 matrix recovery problem. When the tensor is strongly rank-1 completable, we show that the problem is equivalent to a rank-1 matrix completion problem and it can be solved by an iterative formula. For other cases, we propose both nuclear norm relaxation and moment relaxation methods for solving the resulting rank-1 matrix recovery problem. The nuclear norm relaxation sometimes returns a rank-1 tensor completion, while sometimes it does not. When it fails, we apply the moment hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations to solve the rank-1 matrix recovery problem. The moment hierarchy can always get a rank-1 tensor completion, or detect its nonexistence. Numerical experiments are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of these proposed methods.},

We present analysis for the expected change in the LDA discriminant function if one employs the randomized Kaczmarz solution in lieu of the full data least squares solution that accounts for both the Gaussian modeling assumptions on the data and algorithmic randomness. Our analysis shows how the expected change depends on quantities inherent in the data such as the scaled condition number and Frobenius norm of the input data, how well the linear model fits the data, and choices from the randomized algorithm.

Previous algorithms to compute the signature kernel scale quadratically in terms of the length and number of the sequences. To mitigate this severe computational bottleneck, we develop a random Fourier feature-based acceleration of the signature kernel acting on the inherently non-Euclidean domain of sequences. We show uniform approximation guarantees for the proposed unbiased estimator of the signature kernel, while keeping its computation linear in the sequence length and number. In addition, combined with recent advances on tensor projections, we derive two even more scalable time series features with favorable concentration properties and computational complexity both in time and memory. Our empirical results show that the reduction in computational cost comes at a negligible price in terms of accuracy on moderate size datasets, and it enables one to scale to large datasets up to a million time series.

These infinity entries enable sGW to enforce application-induced constraints on preserving pairwise distance to a certain extent. A numerical solver is proposed for the sGW problem and the effectiveness is demonstrated in various numerical experiments. The high-order constraints in sGW are transferred to constraints on the coupling matrix by solving a minimal vertex cover problem. The transformed problem is solved by the mirror-C descent iteration coupled with the supervised optimal transport solver. In the numerical experiments, we first validate the proposed framework by applying it to matching synthetic datasets and investigating the impact of the model parameters. Additionally, we apply sGW to aligning single-cell RNA sequencing data where the datasets are partially overlapping and only intra-dataset metrics are used. Through comparisons with other Gromov–Wasserstein variants, we demonstrate that sGW offers an additional utility of controlling distance preservation, leading to automatic estimation of overlapping portions of datasets, which brings improved stability and flexibility in data-driven applications.

We show that simple rationales such as “setting the derivative to zero” and “gradients are aligned at optimality” carry over to the Wasserstein space. We deploy our tools to study and solve optimization problems in the setting of distributionally robust optimization and statistical inference.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider kernel-based regularized learning with the help of the random projection technique to ease its computational burden. The random projection approaches we study here include the randomized sketching method and the Nyström approximation method. Current works under the least squares loss demonstrated an optimal learning rate under an appropriate source condition and capacity condition. However, beyond this simplest loss, it seems challenging to appropriately incorporate both conditions due to the unavailability of a closed-form solution. In this work, we consider a sufficiently general class of convex losses which include logistic loss, quantile loss, and hinge loss, for example, and establish the same optimal learning rate as in the least squares case under mild regularity assumptions. Our result also covers the unattainable case where the true function is not in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. To incorporate the source condition, Young’s inequality for operators is used, while to characterize the capacity, Rademacher complexity is adopted. We illustrate the performances of random projection with some numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The method of moments is a classical statistical technique for density estimation that solves a system of moment equations to estimate the parameters of an unknown distribution. A fundamental question critical to understanding identifiability asks how many moment equations are needed to get finitely many solutions and how many solutions there are. We answer this question for classes of Gaussian mixture models using the tools of polyhedral geometry. In addition, we show that a generic Gaussian -mixture model is identifiable from its first moments. Using these results, we present a homotopy algorithm that performs parameter recovery for high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models where the number of paths tracked scales linearly in the dimension.},

The estimator is positive definite by construction, and the Mahalanobis distance minimized to obtain it possesses properties enabling practical computation. We show that our manifold regression multifidelity (MRMF) covariance estimator is a maximum likelihood estimator under a certain error model on manifold tangent space. More broadly, we show that our Riemannian regression framework encompasses existing multifidelity covariance estimators constructed from control variates. We demonstrate via numerical examples that the MRMF estimator can provide significant decreases, up to one order of magnitude, in squared estimation error relative to both single-fidelity and other multifidelity covariance estimators. Furthermore, preservation of positive definiteness ensures that our estimator is compatible with downstream tasks, such as data assimilation and metric learning, in which this property is essential.},

We extend earlier work by Nesterov and Polyak to the case of a self-concordant objective with polyhedral constraints, such as the ones considered herein. We propose a Frank–Wolfe method to solve the cubic regularized Newton subproblem and derive efficient solutions for the linear optimization oracles that may be of independent interest. In the particular case of Gaussian mixtures without shape constraints, we derive bounds on how well the finite mixture problem approximates the infinite-dimensional Kiefer–Wolfowitz maximum likelihood estimator.

This paper expands the analysis of randomized low-rank approximation beyond the Gaussian distribution to four classes of random matrices: (1) independent sub-Gaussian entries, (2) independent sub-Gaussian columns, (3) independent bounded columns, and (4) independent columns with bounded second moment. Using a novel interpretation of the low-rank approximation error involving sample covariance matrices, we provide insight into the requirements of a good random matrix for randomized low-rank approximations. Although our bounds involve unspecified absolute constants (a consequence of underlying nonasymptotic theory of random matrices), they allow for qualitative comparisons across distributions. The analysis offers some details on the minimal number of samples (the number of columns of the random matrix ) and the error in the resulting low-rank approximation. We illustrate our analysis in the context of the randomized subspace iteration method as a representative algorithm for low-rank approximation; however, all the results are broadly applicable to other low-rank approximation techniques. We conclude our discussion with numerical examples using both synthetic and real-world test matrices.},

We prove a representer theorem that states that the solution sets to learning problems posed over these Banach spaces are completely characterized by neural architectures with multivariate nonlinearities. These optimal architectures have skip connections and are tightly connected to orthogonal weight normalization and multi-index models, both of which have received recent interest in the neural network community. Our framework is compatible with a number of classical nonlinearities including the rectified linear unit activation function, the norm activation function, and the radial basis functions found in the theory of thin-plate/polyharmonic splines.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Diffusion models are a new class of generative models that revolve around the estimation of the score function associated with an SDE. Subsequent to its acquisition, the approximated score function is then harnessed to simulate the corresponding time-reversal process, ultimately enabling the generation of approximate data samples. Despite their evident practical significance these models carry, a notable challenge persists in the form of a lack of comprehensive quantitative results, especially in scenarios involving nonregular scores and estimators. In almost all reported bounds in Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, it is assumed that either the score function or its approximation is Lipschitz uniformly in time. However, this condition is very restrictive in practice or appears to be difficult to establish. To circumvent this issue, previous works mainly focused on establishing convergence bounds in KL for an early stopped version of the diffusion model and a smoothed version of the data distribution or assuming that the data distribution is supported on a compact manifold. These explorations have led to interesting bounds in either Wasserstein or Fortet–Mourier metrics. However, the question remains about the relevance of such an early stopping procedure or compactness conditions, in particular, if there exists a natural and mild condition ensuring explicit and sharp convergence bounds in KL. In this article, we tackle the aforementioned limitations by focusing on score diffusion models with fixed step size stemming from the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck semigroup and its kinetic counterpart. Our study provides a rigorous analysis, yielding simple, improved, and sharp convergence bounds in KL applicable to any data distribution with finite Fisher information with respect to the standard Gaussian distribution.},

Traditional image processing methods employing PDEs offer a multitude of meaningful regularizers along with valuable theoretical foundations for a wide range of image-related tasks. This makes their integration into neural networks a promising avenue. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization approach inspired by the reverse process of PDE-based evolution models. Specifically, we propose inverse evolution layers (IELs), which serve as bad property amplifiers to penalize neural networks of which outputs have undesired characteristics. Using IELs, one can achieve specific regularization objectives and endow neural network outputs with corresponding properties of the PDE models. Our experiments, focusing on semantic segmentation tasks using heat-diffusion IELs, demonstrate their effectiveness in mitigating noisy label effects. Additionally, we develop curve-motion IELs to enforce convex shape regularization in neural network–based segmentation models for preventing the generation of concave outputs. Our results indicate that IELs may offer a potential regularization mechanism for addressing challenges related to noisy labels.},

First, we theoretically derive what is essentially the unique generalization to ReLU GNNs of the well-known He-initialization. Our initialization scheme guarantees that the average scale of network outputs and gradients remains order one at initialization. Second, we prove in finite width vanilla ReLU GNNs that oversmoothing is unavoidable at large depth when using fixed aggregation operators, regardless of initialization. We then prove that using residual aggregation operators, obtained by interpolating a fixed aggregation operator with the identity, provably alleviates oversmoothing at initialization. Finally, we show that the common practice of using residual connections with a fixup-type initialization provably avoids correlation collapse in final layer features at initialization. Through ablation studies, we find that using the correct initialization, residual aggregation operators, and residual connections in the forward pass significantly and reliably speeds up early training dynamics in deep ReLU GNNs on a variety of tasks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce discretizations of infinite-dimensional optimization problems with total variation regularization and integrality constraints on the optimization variables. We advance the discretization of the dual formulation of the total variation term with Raviart–Thomas functions, which is known from the literature for certain convex problems. Since we have an integrality constraint, the previous analysis from Caillaud and Chambolle [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 43 (2022), pp. 692–736] no longer holds. Even weaker -convergence results no longer hold because the recovery sequences generally need to attain noninteger values to recover the total variation of the limit function. We solve this issue by introducing a discretization of the input functions on an embedded, finer mesh. A superlinear coupling of the mesh sizes implies an averaging on the coarser mesh of the Raviart–Thomas ansatz, which enables us to recover the total variation of integer-valued limit functions with integer-valued discretized input functions. Moreover, we are able to estimate the discretized total variation of the recovery sequence by the total variation of its limit and an error depending on the mesh size ratio. For the discretized optimization problems, we additionally add a constraint that vanishes in the limit and enforces compactness of the sequence of minimizers, which yields their convergence to a minimizer of the original problem. This constraint contains a degree of freedom whose admissible range is determined. Its choice may have a strong impact on the solutions in practice as we demonstrate with an example from imaging.},

It is popular for researchers to prove the intermittency of the solution, which means that the moments of solution to a stochastic heat equation usually grow to infinity exponentially fast and this hints that the solution to stochastic heat equation is generally not stable in long time. However, quite surprisingly in this paper we show that when the domain is bounded and when the noise is not singular in spatial variables, the system can be long time stable and we also prove that we can approximate the solution by its finite dimensional spectral approximation, which is also long time stable. The idea is to use eigenfunction expansion of the Laplacian on a bounded domain to write a stochastic heat equation as a system of infinite many stochastic differential equations. We also present numerical experiments which are consistent with our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose a numerical method to compute the Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow (WHF), which is a Hamiltonian system on the probability density manifold. Many well-known PDE systems can be reformulated as WHFs. We use the parameterized function as a push-forward map to characterize the solution of WHF, and convert the PDE to a finite-dimensional ODE system, which is a Hamiltonian system in the phase space of the parameter manifold. We establish theoretical error bounds for the continuous time approximation scheme in the Wasserstein metric. For the numerical implementation, neural networks are used as push-forward maps. We design an effective symplectic scheme to solve the derived Hamiltonian ODE system so that the method preserves some important quantities such as Hamiltonian. The computation is done by a fully deterministic symplectic integrator without any neural network training. Thus, our method does not involve direct optimization over network parameters and hence can avoid errors introduced by the stochastic gradient descent or similar methods, which are usually hard to quantify and measure in practice. The proposed algorithm is a sampling-based approach that scales well to higher dimensional problems. In addition, the method also provides an alternative connection between the Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives of the original WHF through the parameterized ODE dynamics.},

Both perspectives give rise to mixed finite element methods, which we refer to as strongly and weakly coupled, respectively. We prove convergence of both classes of methods, with particular attention to improved convergence rate estimates, and stability in the limit of vanishing characteristic length of the micropolar structure.

In this paper, we develop and analyze a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) scheme for the Dean–Kawasaki equation, a pivotal representative of this class of SPDEs. We prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that our MLMC scheme provides a significant reduction in computational cost (with respect to a standard Monte Carlo method) in the simulation of the Dean–Kawasaki equation. Specifically, we link this reduction in cost to having a sufficiently large average particle density and show that sizeable cost reductions can be obtained even when we have solutions with regions of low density. Numerical simulations are provided in the two-dimensional case, confirming our theoretical predictions. Our results are formulated entirely in terms of the law of distributions rather than in terms of strong spatial norms: this crucially allows for MLMC speed-ups altogether despite the Dean–Kawasaki equation being highly singular.},

Within a tensor-based ROM framework, the matrix SVD—a traditional dimension reduction technique—yields to a low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTD). Such tensor extension of the Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition ROMs (POD–ROMs) benefits both the practical efficiency of the ROM and its amenability for rigorous error analysis when applied to parametric PDEs. The paper addresses the error analysis of the Galerkin LRTD–ROM for an abstract linear parabolic problem that depends on multiple physical parameters. An error estimate for the LRTD–ROM solution is proved, which is uniform with respect to problem parameters and extends to parameter values not in a sampling/training set. The estimate is given in terms of discretization and sampling mesh properties and LRTD accuracy. The estimate depends on the local smoothness rather than on the Kolmogorov -widths of the parameterized manifold of solutions. Theoretical results are illustrated with several numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a data-driven tool for forecasting and model reduction of dynamics, which has been extensively taken up in the physical sciences. While the method is conceptually simple, in deterministic chaos it is unclear what its properties are or even what it converges to. In particular, it is not clear how EDMD’s least-squares approximation treats the classes of differentiable functions on which chaotic systems act. We develop for the first time a general, rigorous theory of EDMD on the simplest examples of chaotic maps: analytic expanding maps of the circle. To do this, we prove a new, basic approximation result in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC) and apply methods from transfer operator theory. We show that in the infinite-data limit, the least-squares projection error is exponentially small for trigonometric polynomial observable dictionaries. As a result, we show that forecasts and Koopman spectral data produced using EDMD in this setting converge to the physically meaningful limits, exponentially fast with respect to the size of the dictionary. This demonstrates that with only a relatively small polynomial dictionary, EDMD can be very effective, even when the sampling measure is not uniform. Furthermore, our OPUC result suggests that data-based least-squares projection may be a very effective approximation strategy more generally.},

This work targets the discretization of contact-mechanics accounting for small strains, linear elastic constitutive laws, and fractures or faults represented as a network of co-dimension one planar interfaces. This type of model coupled with Darcy flow plays an important role typically for the simulation of fault reactivation by fluid injection in geological storage or the hydraulic fracture stimulation in enhanced geothermal systems. To simplify the presentation, a frictionless contact behavior at matrix fracture interfaces is considered, although the scheme developed in this work readily extends to more complex contact models such as the Mohr–Coulomb friction. To account for the geometrical complexity of subsurface, our discretization is based on the first order virtual element method (VEM), which generalizes the finite element method to polytopal meshes. Following previous works in the finite element framework, the contact conditions are enforced in a weak sense using Nitsche’s formulation based on additional consistent penalization terms. We perform, in a fully discrete framework, the well-posedness and convergence analysis showing an optimal first order error estimate with minimal regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and exhibit the good behavior of the nonlinear semismooth Newton solver.},

In the preasymptotic regime, one expects that if is sufficiently small, then (for physical data) the relative error of the Galerkin solution is controllably small.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies the complexity of matrix Putinar’s Positivstellensätz on the semialgebraic set that is given by the polynomial matrix inequality. When the quadratic module generated by the constrained polynomial matrix is Archimedean, we prove a polynomial bound on the degrees of terms appearing in the representation of matrix Putinar’s Positivstellensätz. Estimates on the exponent and constant are given. As a byproduct, a polynomial bound on the convergence rate of matrix sum-of-squares relaxations is obtained, which resolves an open question raised by Dinh and Pham [J. Complexity, 41 (2017), pp. 58–71]. When the constraining set is unbounded, we also prove a similar bound for the matrix version of Putinar–Vasilescu’s Positivstellensätz by exploiting homogenization techniques.},

Optim., 28 (2018), pp. 2654–2689] to construct Lyapunov functions for optimization algorithms in discrete and continuous time. For smooth, strongly convex objective functions, we relax the requirements necessary for such a construction. As a result, we are able to prove for Polyak’s ordinary differential equations and for a two-parameter family of Nesterov algorithms rates of convergence that improve on those available in the literature. We analyze the interpretation of Nesterov algorithms as discretizations of the Polyak equation. We show that the algorithms are instances of additive Runge–Kutta integrators and discuss the reasons why most discretizations of the differential equation do not result in optimization algorithms with acceleration. We also introduce a modification of Polyak’s equation and study its convergence properties. Finally, we extend the general framework to the stochastic scenario and consider an application to random algorithms with acceleration for overparameterized models; again we are able to prove convergence rates that improve on those in the literature.},

We present optimality conditions for the dual of the worst-case expectation problem, which characterizes worst-case uncertain parameters for its inner maximization problem. This condition offers an alternative proof, a counterexample, and an extension to previous works. Additionally, the condition highlights the potential advantage of a specific distance metric for out-of-sample performance, as exemplified in a numerical study on a facility location problem with demand uncertainty. Furthermore, cutting-plane-based algorithms, equipped with a unified scenario generation framework, are proposed for addressing both unbounded support and second-stage dual feasible regions, with a finite convergence proof under less stringent assumptions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies chance-constrained stochastic optimization problems with finite support. It presents an iterative method that solves reduced-size chance-constrained models obtained by partitioning the scenario set. Each reduced problem is constructed to yield a bound on the optimal value of the original problem. We show how to adapt the partitioning of the scenario set so that our adaptive method returns the optimal solution of the original chance-constrained problem in a finite number of iterations. At the heart of the method lie two fundamental operations: refinement and merging. A refinement operation divides a subset of the partition, whereas a merging operation combines a group of subsets into one. We describe how to use these operations to enhance the bound obtained in each step of the method while preserving the small size of the reduced model. Under mild conditions, we prove that, for specific refinement and merge operations, the bound obtained after solving each reduced model strictly improves throughout the iterative process. Our general method allows the seamless integration of various computational enhancements, significantly reducing the computational time required to solve the reduced chance-constrained problems. The method’s efficiency is assessed through numerical experiments on chance-constrained multidimensional knapsack problems. We study the impact of our method’s components and compare its performance against other methods from the recent literature.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A Discrete-Time Linear Complementarity System (DLCS) is a dynamical system in discrete time whose state evolution is governed by linear dynamics in states and algebraic variables that solve a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). The DLCS is the hybrid dynamical system that is the discrete-time counterpart of the well-known Linear Complementarity System (LCS). We derive sufficient conditions for Lyapunov stability of a DLCS when using a quadratic Lyapunov function that depends only on the state variables and a quadratic Lyapunov function that depends both on the state and the algebraic variables. The sufficient conditions require checking the feasibility of a copositive program over nonconvex cones. Our results only assume that the LCP is solvable and do not require the solutions to be unique. We devise a novel, exact cutting plane algorithm for the verification of stability and the computation of the Lyapunov functions. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first exact approach for stability verification of DLCS. A number of numerical examples are presented to illustrate the approach. Though our main object of study in this paper is the DLCS, the proposed algorithm can be readily applied to the stability verification of LCS. In this context, we show the equivalence between the stability of a LCS and the DLCS, resulting from a time-stepping procedure applied to the LCS for all sufficiently small time steps.},

Given any finite set of nonnegative integers, there exists a closed convex set whose facial dimension signature coincides with this set of integers, that is, the dimensions of its nonempty faces comprise exactly this set of integers. In this work, we show that such sets can be realized as solution sets of systems of finitely many convex quadratic inequalities, and hence are representable via second-order cone programming problems, and are, in particular, spectrahedral. It also follows that these sets are facially exposed, in contrast to earlier constructions. We obtain a lower bound on the minimum number of convex quadratic inequalities needed to represent a closed convex set with prescribed facial dimension signature and show that our bound is tight for some special cases. Finally, we relate the question of finding efficient representations with indecomposability of integer sequences and other topics and discuss a substantial number of open questions.},

We consider a class of hierarchical variational inequality (VI) problems that subsumes VI-constrained optimization and several other problem classes, including the optimal solution selection problem and the optimal Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problem. Our main contribution is threefold. (i) We consider bilevel VIs with monotone and Lipschitz continuous mappings and devise a single-timescale iteratively regularized extragradient method, named IR-EG. We improve the existing iteration complexity results for addressing both bilevel VI and VI-constrained convex optimization problems. (ii) Under the strong monotonicity of the outer-level mapping, we develop a method named IR-EG and derive faster guarantees than those in (i). We also study the iteration complexity of this method under a constant regularization parameter. These results appear to be new for both bilevel VIs and VI-constrained optimization. (iii) To our knowledge, complexity guarantees for computing the optimal NE in nonconvex settings do not exist. Motivated by this lacuna, we consider VI-constrained nonconvex optimization problems and devise an inexactly projected gradient method, named IPR-EG, where the projection onto the unknown set of equilibria is performed using IR-EG with a prescribed termination criterion and an adaptive regularization parameter. We obtain new complexity guarantees in terms of a residual map and an infeasibility metric for computing a stationary point. We validate the theoretical findings using preliminary numerical experiments for computing the best and the worst NEs.},

Although this computational framework presents many advantages, there are only a small number of algorithms which require one LMO evaluation per set per iteration; furthermore, these algorithms require to be convex. Our algorithm appears to be the first in this class which is proven to also converge in the nonconvex setting. Our approach combines a penalty method and a product-space relaxation. We show that one CG step is a sufficient subroutine for our penalty method to converge, and we provide several analytical results on the product-space relaxation’s properties and connections to other problems in optimization. We prove that our average Frank–Wolfe gap converges at a rate of —only a log factor worse than the vanilla CG algorithm with one set.},

For the Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization problem, the goal is to (approximately) minimize the average of the local cost functions held by the regular (nonadversarial) agents in the network. In this paper, we provide a general algorithmic framework for Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization which includes some state-of-the-art algorithms as special cases. We analyze the convergence of algorithms within the framework, and derive a geometric rate of convergence of all regular agents to a ball around the optimal solution (whose size we characterize). Furthermore, we show that approximate consensus can be achieved geometrically fast under some minimal conditions. Our analysis provides insights into the relationship among the convergence region, distance between regular agents’ values, step size, and properties of the agents’ functions for Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization.},

Several new accelerated methods in minimax optimization and fixed-point iterations have recently been discovered, and, interestingly, they rely on a mechanism distinct from Nesterov’s momentum-based acceleration. In this work, we show that these accelerated algorithms exhibit what we call the merging path (MP) property; the trajectories of these algorithms merge quickly. Using this novel MP property, we establish point convergence of existing accelerated minimax algorithms and derive new state-of-the-art algorithms for the strongly-convex-strongly-concave setup and for the prox-grad setup.},

As their main building blocks, the algorithms use simplified models of the objective function and the constraint set, along with a retraction operation to restore feasibility. All the proposed methods come equipped with a finite time efficiency guarantee in terms of a natural stationarity measure. We discuss consequences for nonsmooth optimization over smooth manifolds and over sets cut out by weakly convex inequalities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Explicit exploration in the action space was assumed to be indispensable for online policy gradient methods to avoid a drastic degradation in sample complexity, for solving general reinforcement learning problems over finite state and action spaces. In this paper, we establish for the first time an sample complexity for online policy gradient methods without incorporating any exploration strategies. The essential development consists of two new on-policy evaluation operators and a novel analysis of the stochastic policy mirror descent method (SPMD) [G. Lan, Math. Program., 198 (2022), pp. 1059–1106]. SPMD with the first evaluation operator, called value-based estimation, tailors to the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Provided the Markov chains on the state space of generated policies are uniformly mixing with a nondiminishing minimal visitation measure, an sample complexity is obtained with a linear dependence on the size of the action space. SPMD with the second evaluation operator, namely truncated on-policy Monte Carlo (TOMC), attains an sample complexity, where mildly depends on the effective horizon and the size of the action space with properly chosen Bregman divergence (e.g., Tsallis divergence). SPMD with TOMC also exhibits stronger convergence properties in that it controls the optimality gap with high probability rather than in expectation. In contrast to explicit exploration, these new policy gradient methods can prevent repeatedly committing to potentially high-risk actions when searching for optimal policies.},

In this paper, we study a new parametric robust linear problem (PRLP) whose data are allowed to be perturbed not only on the objective and constraint functions but also on the size of the uncertainty sets. Using a dual approach, we examine the stability and sensitivity properties of PRLP by looking at how the behaviors of its optimal value function and solution map change according to the change of the parameters. More precisely, we examine the closedness and lower and upper semicontinuity of the solution map and the lower and upper semicontinuity as well as Lipschitz property of the optimal value function of PRLP varying around a reference parameter. In this way, we obtain the nonemptiness and boundedness of the solution sets and a characterization for the Lipschitz continuity of the optimal value function for semi-infinite linear programs when fixing the corresponding index sets.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a class of -regularized optimization problems and the associated smooth “overparameterized” optimization problems built upon the Hadamard parametrization, or equivalently, the Hadamard difference parametrization (HDP). We characterize the set of second-order stationary points of the HDP-based model and show that they correspond to some stationary points of the corresponding -regularized model. More importantly, we show that the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) exponent of the HDP-based model at a second-order stationary point can be inferred from that of the corresponding -regularized model under suitable assumptions. Our assumptions are general enough to cover a wide variety of loss functions commonly used in -regularized models, such as the least squares loss function and the logistic loss function. Since the KL exponents of many -regularized models are explicitly known in the literature, our results allow us to leverage these known exponents to deduce the KL exponents at second-order stationary points of the corresponding HDP-based models, which were previously unknown. Finally, we demonstrate how these explicit KL exponents at second-order stationary points can be applied to deducing the explicit local convergence rate of a standard gradient descent method for minimizing the HDP-based model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work addresses (mixed-integer) joint chance-constrained optimization problems in which the only uncertain parameter corresponds to the right-hand side coefficients in an inequality system. It exploits one-dimensional marginals to construct upper and lower models for the underlying joint probability function, which need not be differentiable or satisfy generalized concavity properties. Based on these models, two optimization methods are proposed. Neither of them requires the probability function’s (sub)gradients and can thus be considered derivative-free methods. The first approach iteratively enriches an upper model for the probability function within an outer approximation algorithm that is shown to compute, under mild assumptions, an approximate global solution to the nonconvex chance-constrained problem. When the problem’s data is linear, the outer approximation algorithm requires solving (approximately) a mixed-integer linear programming problem per iteration. The second method works with a lower model and penalization techniques to efficiently compute points satisfying a new criticality condition. The approach, which handles only continuous variables, defines iterates as critical points of a nonlinear master program that can be handled with off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers. Numerical experiments on academic chance-constrained problems highlight the approach’s potential and limitations.},

This paper is intended to serve as a low-hurdle introduction to nonlocality for graduate students and researchers with an engineering mechanics or physics background who did not have a formal introduction to the underlying mathematical basis. We depart from simple examples motivated by structural mechanics to form a physical intuition and demonstrate nonlocality using concepts familiar to most engineers. We then show how concepts of nonlocality are at the core of one of the most active current research fields in applied mechanics, namely, in phase-field modeling of fracture. From a mathematical perspective, these developments rest on the concept of convolution in both its discrete and its continuous forms. The previous mechanical examples may thus serve as an intuitive explanation of what convolution implies from a physical perspective. In the supplementary material we highlight a broader range of applications of the concepts of nonlocality and convolution in other branches of science and engineering by generalizing from the examples explained in detail in the main body of the article.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sparse matrix computations are ubiquitous in scientific computing. Given the recent interest in scientific machine learning, it is natural to ask how sparse matrix computations can leverage neural networks (NNs). Unfortunately, multilayer perceptron (MLP) NNs are typically not natural for either graph or sparse matrix computations. The issue lies with the fact that MLPs require fixed-sized inputs, while scientific applications generally generate sparse matrices with arbitrary dimensions and a wide range of different nonzero patterns (or matrix graph vertex interconnections). While convolutional NNs could possibly address matrix graphs where all vertices have the same number of nearest neighbors, a more general approach is needed for arbitrary sparse matrices, e.g., those arising from discretized partial differential equations on unstructured meshes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one such approach suitable to sparse matrices. The key idea is to define aggregation functions (e.g., summations) that operate on variable-size input data to produce data of a fixed output size so that MLPs can be applied. The goal of this paper is to provide an introduction to GNNs for a numerical linear algebra audience. Concrete GNN examples are provided to illustrate how many common linear algebra tasks can be accomplished using GNNs. We focus on iterative and multigrid methods that employ computational kernels such as matrix-vector products, interpolation, relaxation methods, and strength-of-connection measures. Our GNN examples include cases where parameters are determined a priori as well as cases where parameters must be learned. The intent of this paper is to help computational scientists understand how GNNs can be used to adapt machine learning concepts to computational tasks associated with sparse matrices. It is hoped that this understanding will further stimulate data-driven extensions of classical sparse linear algebra tasks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A dynamical system is a transformation of a phase space, and the transformation law is the primary means of defining as well as identifying the dynamical system and is the object of focus of many learning techniques. However, there are many secondary aspects of dynamical systems—invariant sets, the Koopman operator, and Markov approximations—that provide alternative objectives for learning techniques. Crucially, while many learning methods are focused on the transformation law, we find that forecast performance can depend on how well these other aspects of the dynamics are approximated. These different facets of a dynamical system correspond to objects in completely different spaces—namely, interpolation spaces, compact Hausdorff sets, unitary operators, and Markov operators, respectively. Thus, learning techniques targeting any of these four facets perform different kinds of approximations. We examine whether an approximation of any one of these aspects of the dynamics could lead to an approximation of another facet. Many connections and obstructions are brought to light in this analysis. Special focus is placed on methods of learning the primary feature—the dynamics law itself. The main question considered is the connection between learning this law and reconstructing the Koopman operator and the invariant set. The answers are tied to the ergodic and topological properties of the dynamics, and they reveal how these properties determine the limits of forecasting techniques.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Methods inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) are starting to fundamentally change computational science and engineering through breakthrough performance on challenging problems. However, the reliability and trustworthiness of such techniques is a major concern. In inverse problems in imaging, the focus of this paper, there is increasing empirical evidence that methods may suffer from hallucinations, i.e., false, but realistic-looking artifacts; instability, i.e., sensitivity to perturbations in the data; and unpredictable generalization, i.e., excellent performance on some images, but significant deterioration on others. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for these phenomena. We give mathematical explanations for how and when such effects arise in arbitrary reconstruction methods, with several of our results taking the form of “no free lunch” theorems. Specifically, we show that (i) methods that overperform on a single image can wrongly transfer details from one image to another, creating a hallucination; (ii) methods that overperform on two or more images can hallucinate or be unstable; (iii) optimizing the accuracy-stability tradeoff is generally difficult; (iv) hallucinations and instabilities, if they occur, are not rare events and may be encouraged by standard training; and (v) it may be impossible to construct optimal reconstruction maps for certain problems. Our results trace these effects to the kernel of the forward operator whenever it is nontrivial, but also apply to the case when the forward operator is ill-conditioned. Based on these insights, our work aims to spur research into new ways to develop robust and reliable AI-based methods for inverse problems in imaging.},

We survey the rapid development of risk measures over the last quarter century. From their beginning in financial engineering, we recount their spread to nearly all areas of engineering and applied mathematics. Solidly rooted in convex analysis, risk measures furnish a general framework for handling uncertainty with significant computational and theoretical advantages. We describe the key facts, list several concrete algorithms, and provide an extensive list of references for further reading. The survey recalls connections with utility theory and distributionally robust optimization, points to emerging applications areas such as fair machine learning, and defines measures of reliability.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm is developed specifically for compressing streaming scientific data. The production of scientific data, either via simulation or experiments, is undergoing a stage of exponential growth, which makes data compression important and often necessary for storing and utilizing large scientific data sets. As opposed to classical “offline” compression algorithms that perform compression on a readily available data set, streaming compression algorithms compress data “online” while the data generated from simulation or experiments is still flowing through the system. This feature makes streaming compression algorithms well suited for scientific data compression, where storing the full data set offline is often infeasible. This work proposes a new streaming compression algorithm, streaming weak-SINDy, which takes advantage of the underlying data characteristics during compression. The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm constructs feature matrices and target vectors in the online stage via a streaming integration method in a memory efficient manner. The feature matrices and target vectors are then used in the offline stage to build a model through a regression process that aims to recover equations that govern the evolution of the data. For compressing high-dimensional streaming data, we adopt a streaming proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) process to reduce the data dimension and then use the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to compress the temporal data of the POD expansion. We propose modifications to the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to accommodate the dynamically updated POD basis. By combining the built model from the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm and a small amount of data samples, the full data flow could be reconstructed accurately at a low memory cost, as shown in the numerical tests.},

In particular, we propose and test on real-world scenarios a novel strategy to build data-driven rheological models based on the use of input-convex neural networks (ICNNs), a special class of feedforward neural network scalar-valued functions that are convex with respect to their inputs. Moreover, we show, through a detailed campaign of numerical experiments, that the use of ICNNs is of paramount importance to guarantee the well-posedness of the associated non-Newtonian Stokes differential problem. Finally, building upon a novel perturbation result for non-Newtonian Stokes problems, we study the impact of our data-driven ICNN based rheological model on the accuracy of the finite element approximation.

The proposed preconditioners are constructed by hybridizing the deep operator network, namely, DeepONet, with standard iterative methods. Exploiting the spectral bias, DeepONet-based components are harnessed to address low-frequency error components, while conventional iterative methods are employed to mitigate high-frequency error components. Our preconditioning framework comprises two distinct hybridization approaches: direct preconditioning (DP) and trunk basis (TB). In the DP approach, DeepONet is used to approximate an action of an inverse operator to a vector during each preconditioning step. In contrast, the TB approach extracts basis functions from the trained DeepONet to construct a map to a smaller subspace, in which the low-frequency component of the error can be effectively eliminated. Our numerical results demonstrate that utilizing the TB approach enhances the convergence of Krylov methods by a large margin compared to standard nonhybrid preconditioning strategies. Moreover, the proposed hybrid preconditioners exhibit robustness across a wide range of model parameters and problem resolutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The solution of linear inverse problems arising, for example, in signal and image processing is a challenging problem since the ill-conditioning amplifies, in the solution, the noise present in the data. Recently introduced algorithms based on deep learning overwhelm the more traditional model-based approaches in performance, but they typically suffer from instability with respect to data perturbation. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the trade-off between stability and accuracy of neural networks when used to solve linear imaging inverse problems for cases that are not underdetermined. Moreover, we propose different supervised and unsupervised solutions to increase the network stability and maintain a good accuracy, by means of regularization properties inherited from a model-based iterative scheme during the network training. Extensive numerical experiments on image deblurring confirm the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning–based approaches to handle noise on the data.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a data-driven and physics-informed framework for propagating uncertainty in stiff, multiscale random ordinary differential equations (RODEs) driven by correlated (colored) noise. Unlike systems subjected to Gaussian white noise, a deterministic equation for the joint probability density function (PDF) of RODE state variables does not exist in closed form. Moreover, such an equation would require as many phase-space variables as there are states in the RODE system. To alleviate this curse of dimensionality, we instead derive exact, albeit unclosed, reduced-order PDF (RoPDF) equations for low-dimensional observables/quantities of interest. The unclosed terms take the form of state-dependent conditional expectations, which are directly estimated from data at sparse observation times. However, for systems exhibiting stiff, multiscale dynamics, data sparsity introduces regression discrepancies that compound during RoPDF evolution. This is overcome by introducing a kinetic-like defect term to the RoPDF equation, which is learned by assimilating in sparse, low-fidelity RoPDF estimates. Two assimilation methods are considered, namely nudging and deep neural networks, which are successfully tested against Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used to model sequential data in a wide range of areas, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, machine translation, and time series analysis. In this paper, we model the training process of RNNs with the ReLU activation function as a constrained optimization problem with a smooth nonconvex objective function and piecewise smooth nonconvex constraints. We prove that any feasible point of the optimization problem satisfies the no nonzero abnormal multiplier constraint qualification, and any local minimizer is a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) point of the problem. Moreover, we propose an augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and design an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the subproblems of the ALM. The update of each block of the BCD method has a closed-form solution. The stop criterion for the inner loop is easy to check and can be stopped in finite steps. Moreover, we show that the BCD method can generate a directional stationary point of the subproblem. Furthermore, we establish the global convergence of the ALM to a KKT point of the constrained optimization problem. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ALM for training RNNs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Transition path theory (TPT) is a mathematical framework for quantifying rare transition events between a pair of selected metastable states and . Central to TPT is the committor function, which describes the probability to hit the metastable state prior to from any given starting point of the phase space. Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and the transition rate can be readily found. The committor is the solution to the backward Kolmogorov equation with appropriate boundary conditions. However, solving it is a challenging task in high dimensions due to the need to mesh a whole region of the ambient space. In this work, we explore the finite expression method (FEX, Liang and Yang (2022)) as a tool for computing the committor. FEX approximates the committor by an algebraic expression involving a fixed finite number of nonlinear functions and binary arithmetic operations. The optimal nonlinear functions, the binary operations, and the numerical coefficients in the expression template are found via reinforcement learning. The FEX-based committor solver is tested on several high-dimensional benchmark problems. It gives comparable or better results than neural network-based solvers. Most importantly, FEX is capable of correctly identifying the algebraic structure of the solution which allows one to reduce the committor problem to a low-dimensional one and find the committor with any desired accuracy.},

This paper discusses the multiscale computations for nonlinear dynamic coupled thermomechanical problems in heterogeneous shells, which possess temperature-dependent material properties and orthogonal periodic configurations. The new contributions in this study are the novel coupled formulation with the higher-order correction terms for orthogonal periodic configurations and the global error estimation with an explicit rate for higher-order multiscale solutions in the integral norm sense. By combining the multiscale asymptotic technique and the Taylor series approach, the multiscale method is developed for nonlinear time-dependent thermomechanical problems, which can keep the conservation of local energy and momentum for multiscale simulation. Moreover, an efficient space-time numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is presented in detail. Numerical results show that the proposed method has competitive advantages for solving the dynamic thermomechanical problem in heterogeneous shells, which has exceptional numerical accuracy and less computational cost.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In FEM-based electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis, the subtraction approach has been proposed to simulate sensor measurements generated by neural activity. While this approach possesses a rigorous foundation and produces accurate results, its major downside is that it is computationally prohibitively expensive in practical applications. To overcome this, we developed a new approach, called the local subtraction approach. This approach is designed to preserve the mathematical foundation of the subtraction approach, while also leading to sparse right-hand sides in the FEM formulation, making it efficiently computable. We achieve this by introducing a cut-off into the subtraction, restricting its influence to the immediate neighborhood of the source. We perform validation in multilayer sphere models where analytical solutions exist. There, we demonstrate that the local subtraction approach is vastly more efficient than the subtraction approach. Moreover, we find that for the EEG forward problem, the local subtraction approach is less dependent on the global structure of the FEM mesh when compared to the subtraction approach. Additionally, we show the local subtraction approach to rival, and in many cases even surpass, the other investigated approaches in terms of accuracy. For the MEG forward problem, we show the local subtraction approach and the subtraction approach to produce highly accurate approximations of the volume currents close to the source. The local subtraction approach thus reduces the computational cost of the subtraction approach to an extent that makes it usable in practical applications without sacrificing the rigorousness and accuracy the subtraction approach is known for.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper introduces a code generator designed for extreme-scalable, matrix-free finite element operators on hybrid tetrahedral grids. It optimizes the local evaluation of bilinear forms through various techniques including tabulation, relocation of loop invariants, and interelement vectorization—implemented as transformations of an abstract syntax tree. A key contribution is the generator’s ability to optimize not only the local assembly, but also the loop over the underlying grid. To that end, the developed “cubes” loop pattern leverages local structure resulting from grid refinement and significantly enhances arithmetic intensity. Its effectiveness is established during a memory and layer condition analysis. The paper demonstrates the generator’s capabilities through a comprehensive, educational cycle of performance analysis, bottleneck identification, and emission of dedicated optimizations. For three differential operators (, ), the set of most effective optimizations is determined from a larger pool. They result in matrix-free operators with a kernel throughput of 1.3 to 2.1 GDoF/s, achieving up to 62% peak performance on a 36-core Intel Ice Lake socket. We make performance comparisons with a sparse matrix-vector multiplication and operators generated by the Firedrake project at increasing levels of refinement. Finally, the solution of the curl-curl problem with more than a trillion degrees of freedom on 21,504 processes in less than 50 s showcases the generated operators’ performance and extreme scalability as part of a full multigrid solver.},

The algorithm is built using a dual-weighted residual error estimator. The residuals are based on the eigensystem for leaky hybrid modes obtained from Maxwell equations truncated to a finite domain after a transformation by a perfectly matched layer. The adaptive algorithm is then applied to compute practically interesting modes for multiple fiber microstructures. Emerging microstructured optical fibers are characterized by complex geometrical features in their transverse cross section. Their leaky modes, useful for confining and propagating light in their cores, often exhibit fine-scale features. The adaptive algorithm automatically captures these features without any expert input. The results also show that confinement losses of these modes are captured accurately on the adaptively found meshes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Poisson–Boltzmann equation (PBE) is an implicit solvent continuum model for calculating the electrostatic potential and energies of charged biomolecules in ionic solutions. However, its numerical solution poses significant challenges due to strong singularities in the solution caused by the singular source terms, while in case of the nonlinear PBE (NLPBE) the additional problems arise owing to the exponential nonlinear terms. An efficient method for the treatment of singularities in the linear PBE was introduced in [P. Benner, V. Khoromskaia, B. Khoromskij, C. Kweyu, and M. Stein, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 43 (2021), pp. A415–A445], that is based on the range-separated (RS) tensor decomposition [P. Benner, V. Khoromskaia, and B. N. Khoromskij, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40 (2018), pp. A1034–A1062] for both the electrostatic potential of the biomolecule of interest and the discretized Dirac delta distributions on the right-hand side [B. N. Khoromskij, J. Comput. Phys., 401 (2020), 108998]. In this paper, we introduce the new regularization method to the NLPBE. We apply the NLPBE only to the regular part of the solution corresponding to the modified right-hand side via extraction of the long-range part in the sum of discretized Dirac delta distributions based on the method in [B. N. Khoromskij, J. Comput. Phys., 401 (2020), 108998]. The total electrostatic potential is obtained by adding the long-range solution to the directly precomputed short-range potential, obtained by simple tensor operations without solving PDE. One of the computational benefits of the approach is the automatic preservation of the continuity in the Cauchy data on the solute-solvent interface. The boundary conditions remain verbatim as for the initial nonregularized formulation. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrate the numerical performance of the tensor-based regularization techniques for the NLPBE.},

Furthermore, we derive rigorous error estimates for the tumor and nutrient variables of the first-order scheme. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the accuracy and stability of the proposed schemes.

This article focuses on numerical approximations of the ferrohydrodynamic (FHD) Rosensweig model of ferrofluids, which comprises the Navier–Stokes equations, the angular momentum equations, the magnetization equations, and the magnetostatic equation, as well as the simulations of the ferrofluid rotational flow problems. The model’s strong coupling feature, encompassing both linear and nonlinear aspects, poses a significant challenge in the development of efficient numerical algorithms, particularly for fully decoupled-type schemes with unconditional energy stability. A significant new challenge in the Rosensweig model, as opposed to the relatively well-studied Shliomis FHD model, is the coupling with the extra angular momentum equations, particularly seen in the linear coupling between the angular velocity of the particle spinning and the flow velocity, demanding innovative numerical strategies to effectively address this complexity. By introducing a new nonlocal auxiliary variable and constructing an ordinary differential equation with a special structure for it, we can simplify the complex coupling terms in the modified but equivalent governing system via explicit discretization. This novel method, along with the ZEC (zero energy contribution) decoupling method, reconstruction of the magnetostatic equation, the spatial finite element method, and the second-order projection method for hydrodynamics, allows us to obtain a fully discrete scheme that is unconditionally energy stable, fully decoupled, linear, and second-order accurate in time. Only a few independent linear elliptic/parabolic problems with constant coefficients need to be solved at each time step. The unconditional energy stability and well-posedness of the scheme are also established. In addition, simulations, including 2D/3D spin-up and annular flows, are implemented to verify the stability and accuracy of the scheme, with the numerical results exhibiting good agreement with experimental and physical analyses.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a novel framework for the development of fourth-order lattice Boltzmann schemes to tackle multidimensional nonlinear systems of conservation laws. As for other numerical schemes for hyperbolic problems, high-order accuracy applies only to smooth solutions. Our numerical schemes preserve two fundamental characteristics inherent in classical lattice Boltzmann methods: a local relaxation phase and a transport phase composed of elementary shifts on a Cartesian grid. Achieving fourth-order accuracy is accomplished through the composition of second-order time-symmetric basic schemes utilizing rational weights. This enables the representation of the transport phase in terms of elementary shifts. Introducing local variations in the relaxation parameter during each stage of relaxation ensures entropy stability of the schemes. This not only enhances stability in the long-time limit but also maintains fourth-order accuracy. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive testing on scalar equations and systems in both one and two spatial dimensions.},

Block algorithms offer superior performance, as they are based on BLAS3 matrixwise operations and reduce communication cost when executed in parallel. Notably, our low-synchronization variant of RBGS can be implemented in a parallel environment using only one global reduction operation between processors per block. Moreover, the block Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization is the key element in the block Arnoldi procedure for the construction of a Krylov basis, which in turn is used in GMRES, the full orthogonalization method, and the Rayleigh–Ritz method for the solution of linear systems and clustered eigenvalue problems. In this article, we develop randomized versions of these methods, based on RBGS, and validate them on nontrivial numerical examples. Finally, we extend the proposed methodology to Krylov -step methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. High-dimensional parabolic partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) appear in many applications in insurance and finance. Existing numerical methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality or provide solutions only for a given space-time point. This gave rise to a growing literature on deep learning based methods for solving partial differential equations; results for integro-differential equations on the other hand are scarce. In this paper we consider an extension of the deep splitting scheme, due to Beck et al. [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 43 (2021), pp. A3135–A3154] and Germain, Pham, and Warin [SIAM J. Sci.

This paper aims first to perform robust continuous analysis of a mixed nonlinear formulation for stress-assisted diffusion of a solute that interacts with an elastic material, and second to propose and analyze a virtual element formulation of the model problem. The two-way coupling mechanisms between the Herrmann formulation for linear elasticity and the reaction-diffusion equation (written in mixed form) consist of diffusion-induced active stress and stress-dependent diffusion. The two subproblems are analyzed using the extended Babuška–Brezzi–Braess theory for perturbed saddle-point problems. The well-posedness of the nonlinearly coupled system is established using a Banach fixed-point strategy under the smallness assumption on data. The virtual element formulations for the uncoupled subproblems are proven uniquely solvable by a fixed-point argument in conjunction with appropriate projection operators. We derive the a priori error estimates, and test the accuracy and performance of the proposed method through computational simulations. Reproducibility of computational results.

Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy of the log-likelihood approximation from 3 to 14 digits for a matrix . The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate solutions to linear systems with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are generated by a piecewise smooth .

  abstract     = {Abstract. The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) has been widely used to numerically solve boundary value problems involving linear partial differential equations. This method is easy to implement computationally and can be very effective for smooth domains and boundary conditions. The main drawback of the MFS is the ill-conditioning of the associated matrices, which may deteriorate the method’s accuracy. We present three methods to reduce the ill-conditioning of the classical MFS for the Laplace equation defined in bounded star-shaped domains in 3D. The idea is to expand the MFS basis functions in terms of spherical harmonics, in order to use the reduced QR factorization and singular value decomposition to deal with the ill-conditioning, leading to a better function basis that spans the same approximation space as the classical MFS. The numerical results illustrate that these approaches significantly decrease the ill-conditioning, allowing higher accuracy when compared to the classical MFS.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Parallel across the method time integration can provide small scale parallelism when solving initial value problems. Spectral deferred corrections (SDCs) with a diagonal sweeper, closely related to iterated Runge–Kutta methods proposed by Van der Houwen and Sommeijer, can use a number of threads equal to the number of quadrature nodes in the underlying collocation method. However, convergence speed, efficiency, and stability depend critically on the coefficients of the used SDC preconditioner. Previous approaches used numerical optimization to find good diagonal coefficients. Instead, we propose an approach that allows one to find optimal diagonal coefficients analytically. We show that the resulting parallel SDC methods provide stability domains and convergence order very similar to those of well established serial SDC variants. Using a model for computational cost that assumes 80% efficiency of an implementation of parallel SDCs, we show that our variants are competitive with serial SDC, previously published parallel SDC coefficients, Picard iteration, and a fourth-order explicit as well as a fourth-order implicit diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta method.

We prove that the method ensures an accurate reconstruction at all times and allows us to incorporate relevant physical properties in the reconstructed solutions by suitably evolving the dynamical approximation space. As an application of this strategy we consider Hamiltonian systems modeling wave-type phenomena, where preservation of the geometric structure of the flow plays a crucial role in the accuracy and stability of the reconstructed trajectory.},

The algorithm is based on the use of the lower-order operator within a defect-correction setting, in combination with AMG construction of interpolation operators for velocities and pressures. The preconditioning framework is primarily algebraic, though the operator must be provided. We investigate two relaxation strategies in this setting. Specifically, a novel block factorization approach is devised for Vanka patch systems, which significantly reduces storage requirements and computational overhead, and a Chebyshev adaptation of the LSC-DGS relaxation from [54] is developed to improve parallelism. The preconditioner demonstrates robust performance across a variety of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Stokes problems, often matching or exceeding the effectiveness of an inexact block triangular (or Uzawa) preconditioner, especially in challenging scenarios such as elongated-domain problems.

In order to solve the resulting problem, we use a version of the split Bregman (ADMM) iteration adapted to the problem.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose and study an Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) finite volume scheme for the compressible Euler system which preserves the low Mach number limit. IMEX schemes are based on a flux splitting into a part treated explicitly and a part treated implicitly. We choose the flux splitting introduced by Toro and Vázquez-Cendón in [Comput. &amp; Fluids, 70 (2012), pp. 1–12] for ensuring the recognition of contact discontinuities and shear waves. Then, based on this flux splitting, we propose first- and second-order new linear asymptotic preserving (AP) schemes in the low Mach number limit. We prove that the schemes are asymptotically consistent, that is they degenerate into a consistent discretization of the incompressible system when the Mach number is sufficiently small. We perform a Fourier stability analysis on the linearized system around a constant state showing that the first order scheme is stable under a CFL condition independent of the Mach number. This proves the asymptotic stability in the linear case. We show one-dimensional and two-dimensional results which prove the good behavior of our scheme in all-Mach number regimes. Furthermore, following [G. Dimarco et al., J. Comput. Phys., 372 (2018), pp. 178–201], we construct a low-diffusive TVD first-order scheme by interpolating the first-order in time scheme with a second-order one.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider stopping criteria that balance algebraic and discretization errors for the conjugate gradient algorithm applied to high-order finite element discretizations of Poisson problems. First, we introduce a new stopping criterion that suggests stopping when the norm of the linear system residual is less than a small fraction of an error indicator derived directly from the residual. This indicator shares the same mesh size and polynomial degree scaling as the norm of the residual, resulting in a robust criterion regardless of the mesh size, the polynomial degree, and the shape regularity of the mesh. Second, for solving Poisson problems with highly variable piecewise constant coefficients, we introduce a subdomain-based criterion that recommends stopping when the norm of the linear system residual restricted to each subdomain is smaller than the corresponding indicator also restricted to that subdomain. Reliability and efficiency theorems for the first criterion are established. Numerical experiments, including tests with highly variable piecewise constant coefficients and a GPU-accelerated three-dimensional elliptic solver, demonstrate that the proposed criteria efficiently avoid both premature termination and oversolving.},

We write a new weak formulation in terms of the stream function of the velocity field. Next, we propose -virtual element methods of high-order to discretize this formulation, and a novel analysis to prove optimal error estimates in the -norm under minimal regularity conditions on the weak stream function is developed. Moreover, algorithms to compute the velocity, pressure, and vorticity fields as a postprocess of the discrete stream function are proposed. Furthermore, we provide a comparison between our methods and other numerical schemes in terms of computational standpoint, which indicates that the stream function virtual element formulation is an attractive, efficient, and competitive alternative to solve the Navier–Stokes system. Finally, we report several benchmark numerical tests to support our theoretical findings and highlight interesting features of our discrete scheme.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Two related numerical schemes for the realization of the Mortensen observer or minimum energy estimator for the state reconstruction of nonlinear dynamical systems subject to deterministic disturbances are proposed and compared. Both approaches rely on a polynomial approximation of the value function associated with the energy of the disturbances of the system. Such an approximation is obtained via interpolation considering not only the values but also first and second order derivatives of the value function in a set of sampling points. The scheme is applied to four examples, and the results are compared with the well-known extended Kalman filter. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is known that any real coordinate transformation (RCT) to compress waves in an unbounded domain into a bounded domain results in infinite oscillations that cannot be resolved by any grid-based method. In this paper, we intend to show that it is viable if the outgoing waves are compressed along the radial direction and the resulting oscillatory pattern is extracted explicitly. We therefore construct a perfectly matched layer-type technique for domain reduction of wave scattering problems using RCT, termed as real compressed layer (RCL). Unlike many existing approaches, the RCT transforms the slow, algebraically decaying factor of the outgoing wave into one that decays exponentially fast, and the layer is not “artificial” in the sense that the computed field in the layer can recover the outgoing wave of the original scattering problem in the unbounded domain. Here we demonstrate the essential idea and performance of the RCL for the two-dimensional Helmholtz problem with a bounded scatterer, but this technique can be extended to three dimensions in a similar setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Model order reduction provides low-complexity high-fidelity surrogate models that allow rapid and accurate solutions of parametric differential equations. The development of reduced order models for parametric nonlinear Hamiltonian systems is challenged by several factors: (i) the geometric structure encoding the physical properties of the dynamics; (ii) the slowly decaying Kolmogorov -width of conservative dynamics; (iii) the gradient structure of the nonlinear flow velocity; (iv) high variations in the numerical rank of the state as a function of time and parameters. We propose to address these aspects via a structure-preserving adaptive approach that combines symplectic dynamical low-rank approximation with adaptive gradient-preserving hyper-reduction and parameters sampling. Additionally, we propose varying in time the dimensions of both the reduced basis space and the hyper-reduction space by monitoring the quality of the reduced solution via an error indicator related to the projection error of the Hamiltonian vector field. The resulting adaptive hyper-reduced models preserve the geometric structure of the Hamiltonian flow, do not rely on prior information on the dynamics, and can be solved at a cost that is linear in the dimension of the full order model and linear in the number of test parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performances of the fully adaptive models compared to the original and reduced models.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. There exist excellent codes for an efficient numerical treatment of stiff and differential-algebraic problems. Let us mention Radau5, which is based on the three-stage Radau IIA collocation method, and its extension to problems with discrete delays, Radar5. The aim of the present work is to present a technique that permits a direct application of these codes to problems having a right-hand side with an additional distributed delay term (which is a special case of an integro-differential equation). Models with distributed delays are of increasing importance in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics for the study of the interaction between drugs and the body. The main idea is to approximate the distribution kernel of the integral term by a sum of exponential functions or by a quasi-polynomial expansion and then to transform the distributed (integral) delay term into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This set is typically stiff, and, for some distribution kernels (e.g., Pareto distribution), it contains discrete delay terms with constant delay. The original equations augmented by this set of ODEs can have a very large dimension, and a careful treatment of the solution of the arising linear systems is necessary. The use of the codes Radau5 and Radar5 is illustrated with three examples (two test equations and one problem taken from pharmacodynamics). The driver programs for these examples are publicly available from the home pages of the authors.},

Our method aims at minimizing the approximation error in the frequency and parameter domain by an optimization of the reduced order model (ROM) matrices. State-of-the-art PMOR methods often compute several nonparametric ROMs for different parameter samples, which are then combined to a single parametric ROM. However, these parametric ROMs can have a low accuracy between the utilized sample points. In contrast, our optimization-based PMOR method minimizes the approximation error across the entire parameter domain. Moreover, due to our flexible approach of optimizing the system matrices directly, we can enforce favorable features, such as a port-Hamiltonian structure, in our ROMs across the entire parameter domain. Our method is an extension of the recently developed structured optimization-based model order reduction algorithm to parametric systems. We extend both the ROM parameterization and the adaptive sampling procedure to the parametric case. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of our method in comparison with other PMOR methods.},

Many significant differential equations, including ordinary differential equations with a first integral (or Lyapunov function), Hamiltonian systems, Poisson systems, and dissipative systems, can be formulated as “linear-gradient systems.” Geometric integration aims to develop numerical integrators that preserve key properties of continuous systems, such as symplecticity for Hamiltonian systems and energy dissipation for dissipative systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of geometric integrators for linear-gradient systems by incorporating a dimension-extended technique. By introducing a vector-valued function, the original linear-gradient system is transformed into an equivalent system in an extended space. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the numerical solution of the extended system serves as a reliable approximation of the original system and can retain its essential conservative properties. In this dimension-extended framework, the newly derived methods can equivalently recover well-known numerical schemes such as quadratic auxiliary variable methods and energy quadratization methods. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the accuracy, efficiency, and long-term stability of our proposed schemes.},

Through strategic selection of the local interpolation polynomial and block size, the method achieves high-order convergence for calculation of convolution integrals with hyperbolic kernels.

  abstract     = {Dedicated to A. N. Shiryaev on his 90th birthday A general diffusion semimartingale is a one-dimensional path-continuous semimartingale that is also a regular strong Markov process. We say that a continuous semimartingale has the representation property if all local martingales w.r.t. its canonical filtration have an integral representation w.r.t. its continuous local martingale part. The representation property is of fundamental interest in the field of mathematical finance, where it is strongly connected to market completeness. The main result from this paper shows that the representation property holds for a general diffusion semimartingale (that is not started in an absorbing boundary point) if and only if its scale function is (locally) absolutely continuous on the interior of the state space. As an application of our main theorem, we deduce that the laws of general diffusion semimartingales with such scale functions are extreme points of their semimartingale problems, and, moreover, we construct a general diffusion semimartingale whose law is no extreme point of its semimartingale problem. These observations contribute to a solution of problems posed by J. Jacod and M. Yor and D. W. Stroock and M. Yor, respectively, on the extremality of strong Markov solutions.},

We establish a link between branching random walks with signed branching sources of various intensities and the structure of the spectrum of the evolutionary operator for the mean population size of particles at the lattice points. In this connection, we solve the problem of the number of eigenvalues of a finite-dimensional non-self-adjoint perturbation $A+B$ of a non-self-adjoint operator $A$ in a real Hilbert space. We prove that the number of eigenvalues of the operator $A+B$ exceeding the upper bound of the spectrum of the operator $A$ is majorized by the number of positive eigenvalues of the operator $B$, and the number of eigenvalues of the operator $A+B$ smaller than the lower bound of the spectrum of the operator $A$ is majorized by the number of negative eigenvalues of the operator $B$.},

  abstract     = {We derive new properties of the sequential parameter estimators for diffusion-type processes $\mathbf{X}=\{X_t,\, 0\leq t\leq \tau \}$, where $\tau $ is a stopping time (this includes the case of fixed sample size estimate). Some earlier theoretical results in this direction can be found in the book [R. S. Liptser and A. N. Shiryaev, Statistics of Random Processes, Springer, 2001]. Under an essentially less restrictive setting, we derive formulas for the moments of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the parameter $\lambda $ of the drift coefficient $f_{t}(\lambda )=a_{t}-\lambda b_{t}$ and prove the exponential boundedness of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ under a mild condition. In the provided examples we consider the mean-reverting ergodic diffusion process $\mathbf{X}$, where $b_{t}=X_{t}$, and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma_{t}=\sigma X_{t}^{\gamma }$. In particular, we provide nonasymptotic analytical and numerical results for the bias and mean-square error of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (O--U) and Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) processes when $\tau =T$ is a fixed sample size, and $\tau =\tau_{H}$ is a specially chosen stopping time that guarantees a prescribed magnitude of $1/H$ for the variance of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau_{H}}$.},

An agent&#39;s strategy is called survival if its share of the total market wealth is bounded away from zero over the infinite time horizon regardless of the strategies used by the other agents. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for survival of strategies, which generalize known results that deal with construction of such strategies or only with necessary conditions for survival. The proofs rely mainly on martingale convergence theorems.},
