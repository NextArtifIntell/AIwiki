  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper a streaming weak-SINDy algorithm is developed specifically for compressing streaming scientific data. The production of scientific data, either via simulation or experiments, is undergoing a stage of exponential growth, which makes data compression important and often necessary for storing and utilizing large scientific data sets. As opposed to classical “offline” compression algorithms that perform compression on a readily available data set, streaming compression algorithms compress data “online” while the data generated from simulation or experiments is still flowing through the system. This feature makes streaming compression algorithms well suited for scientific data compression, where storing the full data set offline is often infeasible. This work proposes a new streaming compression algorithm, streaming weak-SINDy, which takes advantage of the underlying data characteristics during compression. The streaming weak-SINDy algorithm constructs feature matrices and target vectors in the online stage via a streaming integration method in a memory efficient manner. The feature matrices and target vectors are then used in the offline stage to build a model through a regression process that aims to recover equations that govern the evolution of the data. For compressing high-dimensional streaming data, we adopt a streaming proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) process to reduce the data dimension and then use the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to compress the temporal data of the POD expansion. We propose modifications to the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm to accommodate the dynamically updated POD basis. By combining the built model from the streaming weak-SINDy algorithm and a small amount of data samples, the full data flow could be reconstructed accurately at a low memory cost, as shown in the numerical tests.},

In this paper we address the importance and the impact of employing structure-preserving neural networks as a surrogate of the analytical physics-based models typically employed to describe the rheology of non-Newtonian fluids in Stokes flows. In particular, we propose and test on real-world scenarios a novel strategy to build data-driven rheological models based on the use of input-convex neural networks (ICNNs), a special class of feedforward neural network scalar-valued functions that are convex with respect to their inputs. Moreover, we show, through a detailed campaign of numerical experiments, that the use of ICNNs is of paramount importance to guarantee the well-posedness of the associated non-Newtonian Stokes differential problem. Finally, building upon a novel perturbation result for non-Newtonian Stokes problems, we study the impact of our data-driven ICNN based rheological model on the accuracy of the finite element approximation.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new class of hybrid preconditioners for solving parametric linear systems of equations. The proposed preconditioners are constructed by hybridizing the deep operator network, namely, DeepONet, with standard iterative methods. Exploiting the spectral bias, DeepONet-based components are harnessed to address low-frequency error components, while conventional iterative methods are employed to mitigate high-frequency error components. Our preconditioning framework comprises two distinct hybridization approaches: direct preconditioning (DP) and trunk basis (TB). In the DP approach, DeepONet is used to approximate an action of an inverse operator to a vector during each preconditioning step. In contrast, the TB approach extracts basis functions from the trained DeepONet to construct a map to a smaller subspace, in which the low-frequency component of the error can be effectively eliminated. Our numerical results demonstrate that utilizing the TB approach enhances the convergence of Krylov methods by a large margin compared to standard nonhybrid preconditioning strategies. Moreover, the proposed hybrid preconditioners exhibit robustness across a wide range of model parameters and problem resolutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The solution of linear inverse problems arising, for example, in signal and image processing is a challenging problem since the ill-conditioning amplifies, in the solution, the noise present in the data. Recently introduced algorithms based on deep learning overwhelm the more traditional model-based approaches in performance, but they typically suffer from instability with respect to data perturbation. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the trade-off between stability and accuracy of neural networks when used to solve linear imaging inverse problems for cases that are not underdetermined. Moreover, we propose different supervised and unsupervised solutions to increase the network stability and maintain a good accuracy, by means of regularization properties inherited from a model-based iterative scheme during the network training. Extensive numerical experiments on image deblurring confirm the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning–based approaches to handle noise on the data.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a data-driven and physics-informed framework for propagating uncertainty in stiff, multiscale random ordinary differential equations (RODEs) driven by correlated (colored) noise. Unlike systems subjected to Gaussian white noise, a deterministic equation for the joint probability density function (PDF) of RODE state variables does not exist in closed form. Moreover, such an equation would require as many phase-space variables as there are states in the RODE system. To alleviate this curse of dimensionality, we instead derive exact, albeit unclosed, reduced-order PDF (RoPDF) equations for low-dimensional observables/quantities of interest. The unclosed terms take the form of state-dependent conditional expectations, which are directly estimated from data at sparse observation times. However, for systems exhibiting stiff, multiscale dynamics, data sparsity introduces regression discrepancies that compound during RoPDF evolution. This is overcome by introducing a kinetic-like defect term to the RoPDF equation, which is learned by assimilating in sparse, low-fidelity RoPDF estimates. Two assimilation methods are considered, namely nudging and deep neural networks, which are successfully tested against Monte Carlo simulations.},

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used to model sequential data in a wide range of areas, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, machine translation, and time series analysis. In this paper, we model the training process of RNNs with the ReLU activation function as a constrained optimization problem with a smooth nonconvex objective function and piecewise smooth nonconvex constraints. We prove that any feasible point of the optimization problem satisfies the no nonzero abnormal multiplier constraint qualification, and any local minimizer is a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) point of the problem. Moreover, we propose an augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and design an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the subproblems of the ALM. The update of each block of the BCD method has a closed-form solution. The stop criterion for the inner loop is easy to check and can be stopped in finite steps. Moreover, we show that the BCD method can generate a directional stationary point of the subproblem. Furthermore, we establish the global convergence of the ALM to a KKT point of the constrained optimization problem. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ALM for training RNNs.},

Central to TPT is the committor function, which describes the probability to hit the metastable state prior to from any given starting point of the phase space. Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and the transition rate can be readily found. The committor is the solution to the backward Kolmogorov equation with appropriate boundary conditions. However, solving it is a challenging task in high dimensions due to the need to mesh a whole region of the ambient space. In this work, we explore the finite expression method (FEX, Liang and Yang (2022)) as a tool for computing the committor. FEX approximates the committor by an algebraic expression involving a fixed finite number of nonlinear functions and binary arithmetic operations. The optimal nonlinear functions, the binary operations, and the numerical coefficients in the expression template are found via reinforcement learning. The FEX-based committor solver is tested on several high-dimensional benchmark problems. It gives comparable or better results than neural network-based solvers. Most importantly, FEX is capable of correctly identifying the algebraic structure of the solution which allows one to reduce the committor problem to a low-dimensional one and find the committor with any desired accuracy.},

The new contributions in this study are the novel coupled formulation with the higher-order correction terms for orthogonal periodic configurations and the global error estimation with an explicit rate for higher-order multiscale solutions in the integral norm sense. By combining the multiscale asymptotic technique and the Taylor series approach, the multiscale method is developed for nonlinear time-dependent thermomechanical problems, which can keep the conservation of local energy and momentum for multiscale simulation. Moreover, an efficient space-time numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is presented in detail.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In FEM-based electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis, the subtraction approach has been proposed to simulate sensor measurements generated by neural activity. While this approach possesses a rigorous foundation and produces accurate results, its major downside is that it is computationally prohibitively expensive in practical applications. To overcome this, we developed a new approach, called the local subtraction approach. This approach is designed to preserve the mathematical foundation of the subtraction approach, while also leading to sparse right-hand sides in the FEM formulation, making it efficiently computable. We achieve this by introducing a cut-off into the subtraction, restricting its influence to the immediate neighborhood of the source. We perform validation in multilayer sphere models where analytical solutions exist. There, we demonstrate that the local subtraction approach is vastly more efficient than the subtraction approach. Moreover, we find that for the EEG forward problem, the local subtraction approach is less dependent on the global structure of the FEM mesh when compared to the subtraction approach. Additionally, we show the local subtraction approach to rival, and in many cases even surpass, the other investigated approaches in terms of accuracy. For the MEG forward problem, we show the local subtraction approach and the subtraction approach to produce highly accurate approximations of the volume currents close to the source. The local subtraction approach thus reduces the computational cost of the subtraction approach to an extent that makes it usable in practical applications without sacrificing the rigorousness and accuracy the subtraction approach is known for.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper introduces a code generator designed for extreme-scalable, matrix-free finite element operators on hybrid tetrahedral grids. It optimizes the local evaluation of bilinear forms through various techniques including tabulation, relocation of loop invariants, and interelement vectorization—implemented as transformations of an abstract syntax tree. A key contribution is the generator’s ability to optimize not only the local assembly, but also the loop over the underlying grid. To that end, the developed “cubes” loop pattern leverages local structure resulting from grid refinement and significantly enhances arithmetic intensity. Its effectiveness is established during a memory and layer condition analysis. The paper demonstrates the generator’s capabilities through a comprehensive, educational cycle of performance analysis, bottleneck identification, and emission of dedicated optimizations. For three differential operators (, ), the set of most effective optimizations is determined from a larger pool. They result in matrix-free operators with a kernel throughput of 1.3 to 2.1 GDoF/s, achieving up to 62% peak performance on a 36-core Intel Ice Lake socket. We make performance comparisons with a sparse matrix-vector multiplication and operators generated by the Firedrake project at increasing levels of refinement. Finally, the solution of the curl-curl problem with more than a trillion degrees of freedom on 21,504 processes in less than 50 s showcases the generated operators’ performance and extreme scalability as part of a full multigrid solver.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An adaptive algorithm for computing eigenmodes and propagation constants of optical fibers is proposed. The algorithm is built using a dual-weighted residual error estimator. The residuals are based on the eigensystem for leaky hybrid modes obtained from Maxwell equations truncated to a finite domain after a transformation by a perfectly matched layer. The adaptive algorithm is then applied to compute practically interesting modes for multiple fiber microstructures. Emerging microstructured optical fibers are characterized by complex geometrical features in their transverse cross section. Their leaky modes, useful for confining and propagating light in their cores, often exhibit fine-scale features. The adaptive algorithm automatically captures these features without any expert input. The results also show that confinement losses of these modes are captured accurately on the adaptively found meshes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Poisson–Boltzmann equation (PBE) is an implicit solvent continuum model for calculating the electrostatic potential and energies of charged biomolecules in ionic solutions. However, its numerical solution poses significant challenges due to strong singularities in the solution caused by the singular source terms, while in case of the nonlinear PBE (NLPBE) the additional problems arise owing to the exponential nonlinear terms. An efficient method for the treatment of singularities in the linear PBE was introduced in [P. Benner, V. Khoromskaia, B. Khoromskij, C. Kweyu, and M. Stein, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 43 (2021), pp. A415–A445], that is based on the range-separated (RS) tensor decomposition [P. Benner, V. Khoromskaia, and B. N. Khoromskij, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40 (2018), pp. A1034–A1062] for both the electrostatic potential of the biomolecule of interest and the discretized Dirac delta distributions on the right-hand side [B. N. Khoromskij, J. Comput. Phys., 401 (2020), 108998]. In this paper, we introduce the new regularization method to the NLPBE. We apply the NLPBE only to the regular part of the solution corresponding to the modified right-hand side via extraction of the long-range part in the sum of discretized Dirac delta distributions based on the method in [B. N. Khoromskij, J. Comput. Phys., 401 (2020), 108998]. The total electrostatic potential is obtained by adding the long-range solution to the directly precomputed short-range potential, obtained by simple tensor operations without solving PDE. One of the computational benefits of the approach is the automatic preservation of the continuity in the Cauchy data on the solute-solvent interface. The boundary conditions remain verbatim as for the initial nonregularized formulation. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrate the numerical performance of the tensor-based regularization techniques for the NLPBE.},

For this tumor growth model described by the nonlinear system consisting of a Cahn–Hilliard-type equation coupled with a reaction-diffusion equation, we first prove the existence of its weak solutions. Efficient first- and second-order schemes are then constructed based on the idea of the scalar auxiliary variable, which we show are not only decoupled and easy to implement, but also have the properties of mass conservation and unconditional energy stability. Furthermore, we derive rigorous error estimates for the tumor and nutrient variables of the first-order scheme. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the accuracy and stability of the proposed schemes. It is worth noting that when the scheme is equipped with an adaptive time-stepping strategy, it efficiently simulates the typical phenomena of aggregation of multiple tumors with different shapes and tumor chemotactic growth.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article focuses on numerical approximations of the ferrohydrodynamic (FHD) Rosensweig model of ferrofluids, which comprises the Navier–Stokes equations, the angular momentum equations, the magnetization equations, and the magnetostatic equation, as well as the simulations of the ferrofluid rotational flow problems. The model’s strong coupling feature, encompassing both linear and nonlinear aspects, poses a significant challenge in the development of efficient numerical algorithms, particularly for fully decoupled-type schemes with unconditional energy stability. A significant new challenge in the Rosensweig model, as opposed to the relatively well-studied Shliomis FHD model, is the coupling with the extra angular momentum equations, particularly seen in the linear coupling between the angular velocity of the particle spinning and the flow velocity, demanding innovative numerical strategies to effectively address this complexity. By introducing a new nonlocal auxiliary variable and constructing an ordinary differential equation with a special structure for it, we can simplify the complex coupling terms in the modified but equivalent governing system via explicit discretization. This novel method, along with the ZEC (zero energy contribution) decoupling method, reconstruction of the magnetostatic equation, the spatial finite element method, and the second-order projection method for hydrodynamics, allows us to obtain a fully discrete scheme that is unconditionally energy stable, fully decoupled, linear, and second-order accurate in time. Only a few independent linear elliptic/parabolic problems with constant coefficients need to be solved at each time step. The unconditional energy stability and well-posedness of the scheme are also established. In addition, simulations, including 2D/3D spin-up and annular flows, are implemented to verify the stability and accuracy of the scheme, with the numerical results exhibiting good agreement with experimental and physical analyses.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a novel framework for the development of fourth-order lattice Boltzmann schemes to tackle multidimensional nonlinear systems of conservation laws. As for other numerical schemes for hyperbolic problems, high-order accuracy applies only to smooth solutions. Our numerical schemes preserve two fundamental characteristics inherent in classical lattice Boltzmann methods: a local relaxation phase and a transport phase composed of elementary shifts on a Cartesian grid. Achieving fourth-order accuracy is accomplished through the composition of second-order time-symmetric basic schemes utilizing rational weights. This enables the representation of the transport phase in terms of elementary shifts. Introducing local variations in the relaxation parameter during each stage of relaxation ensures entropy stability of the schemes. This not only enhances stability in the long-time limit but also maintains fourth-order accuracy. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive testing on scalar equations and systems in both one and two spatial dimensions.},

RBGS extends the single-vector randomized Gram–Schmidt algorithm and inherits its key characteristics, such as being more efficient and at least as stable as any deterministic (block) Gram–Schmidt algorithm. Block algorithms offer superior performance, as they are based on BLAS3 matrixwise operations and reduce communication cost when executed in parallel. Notably, our low-synchronization variant of RBGS can be implemented in a parallel environment using only one global reduction operation between processors per block. Moreover, the block Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization is the key element in the block Arnoldi procedure for the construction of a Krylov basis, which in turn is used in GMRES, the full orthogonalization method, and the Rayleigh–Ritz method for the solution of linear systems and clustered eigenvalue problems. In this article, we develop randomized versions of these methods, based on RBGS, and validate them on nontrivial numerical examples. Finally, we extend the proposed methodology to Krylov -step methods.},

This paper aims first to perform robust continuous analysis of a mixed nonlinear formulation for stress-assisted diffusion of a solute that interacts with an elastic material, and second to propose and analyze a virtual element formulation of the model problem. The two-way coupling mechanisms between the Herrmann formulation for linear elasticity and the reaction-diffusion equation (written in mixed form) consist of diffusion-induced active stress and stress-dependent diffusion. The two subproblems are analyzed using the extended Babuška–Brezzi–Braess theory for perturbed saddle-point problems. The well-posedness of the nonlinearly coupled system is established using a Banach fixed-point strategy under the smallness assumption on data. The virtual element formulations for the uncoupled subproblems are proven uniquely solvable by a fixed-point argument in conjunction with appropriate projection operators. We derive the a priori error estimates, and test the accuracy and performance of the proposed method through computational simulations. Reproducibility of computational results.

The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate solutions to linear systems with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are generated by a piecewise smooth .

This method is easy to implement computationally and can be very effective for smooth domains and boundary conditions. The main drawback of the MFS is the ill-conditioning of the associated matrices, which may deteriorate the method’s accuracy. We present three methods to reduce the ill-conditioning of the classical MFS for the Laplace equation defined in bounded star-shaped domains in 3D. The idea is to expand the MFS basis functions in terms of spherical harmonics, in order to use the reduced QR factorization and singular value decomposition to deal with the ill-conditioning, leading to a better function basis that spans the same approximation space as the classical MFS. The numerical results illustrate that these approaches significantly decrease the ill-conditioning, allowing higher accuracy when compared to the classical MFS.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Parallel across the method time integration can provide small scale parallelism when solving initial value problems. Spectral deferred corrections (SDCs) with a diagonal sweeper, closely related to iterated Runge–Kutta methods proposed by Van der Houwen and Sommeijer, can use a number of threads equal to the number of quadrature nodes in the underlying collocation method. However, convergence speed, efficiency, and stability depend critically on the coefficients of the used SDC preconditioner. Previous approaches used numerical optimization to find good diagonal coefficients. Instead, we propose an approach that allows one to find optimal diagonal coefficients analytically. We show that the resulting parallel SDC methods provide stability domains and convergence order very similar to those of well established serial SDC variants. Using a model for computational cost that assumes 80% efficiency of an implementation of parallel SDCs, we show that our variants are competitive with serial SDC, previously published parallel SDC coefficients, Picard iteration, and a fourth-order explicit as well as a fourth-order implicit diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta method.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing an unknown function from a finite set of measurements, under the assumption that is the trajectory of a transport-dominated problem with unknown input parameters. We propose an algorithm based on the Parameterized Background Data-Weak method (PBDW), where dynamical sensor placement is combined with approximation spaces that evolve in time. We prove that the method ensures an accurate reconstruction at all times and allows us to incorporate relevant physical properties in the reconstructed solutions by suitably evolving the dynamical approximation space. As an application of this strategy we consider Hamiltonian systems modeling wave-type phenomena, where preservation of the geometric structure of the flow plays a crucial role in the accuracy and stability of the reconstructed trajectory.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate a novel monolithic algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner for the Taylor–Hood and Scott–Vogelius discretizations of the Stokes equations. The algorithm is based on the use of the lower-order operator within a defect-correction setting, in combination with AMG construction of interpolation operators for velocities and pressures. The preconditioning framework is primarily algebraic, though the operator must be provided. We investigate two relaxation strategies in this setting. Specifically, a novel block factorization approach is devised for Vanka patch systems, which significantly reduces storage requirements and computational overhead, and a Chebyshev adaptation of the LSC-DGS relaxation from [54] is developed to improve parallelism. The preconditioner demonstrates robust performance across a variety of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Stokes problems, often matching or exceeding the effectiveness of an inexact block triangular (or Uzawa) preconditioner, especially in challenging scenarios such as elongated-domain problems.

The purpose of these problems is to remove noise or fill in missing parts while preserving important features such as sharp edges. A discrete variant of the total variation of the unit normal vector field serves as a regularizing functional to achieve these goals. In order to solve the resulting problem, we use a version of the split Bregman (ADMM) iteration adapted to the problem. A new formulation of the total variation regularizer, as well as the use of an inexact Newton method for the shape optimization step, brings significant speed-up compared to earlier methods.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we propose and study an Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) finite volume scheme for the compressible Euler system which preserves the low Mach number limit. IMEX schemes are based on a flux splitting into a part treated explicitly and a part treated implicitly. We choose the flux splitting introduced by Toro and Vázquez-Cendón in [Comput. &amp; Fluids, 70 (2012), pp. 1–12] for ensuring the recognition of contact discontinuities and shear waves. Then, based on this flux splitting, we propose first- and second-order new linear asymptotic preserving (AP) schemes in the low Mach number limit. We prove that the schemes are asymptotically consistent, that is they degenerate into a consistent discretization of the incompressible system when the Mach number is sufficiently small. We perform a Fourier stability analysis on the linearized system around a constant state showing that the first order scheme is stable under a CFL condition independent of the Mach number. This proves the asymptotic stability in the linear case. We show one-dimensional and two-dimensional results which prove the good behavior of our scheme in all-Mach number regimes. Furthermore, following [G. Dimarco et al., J. Comput. Phys., 372 (2018), pp. 178–201], we construct a low-diffusive TVD first-order scheme by interpolating the first-order in time scheme with a second-order one.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider stopping criteria that balance algebraic and discretization errors for the conjugate gradient algorithm applied to high-order finite element discretizations of Poisson problems. First, we introduce a new stopping criterion that suggests stopping when the norm of the linear system residual is less than a small fraction of an error indicator derived directly from the residual. This indicator shares the same mesh size and polynomial degree scaling as the norm of the residual, resulting in a robust criterion regardless of the mesh size, the polynomial degree, and the shape regularity of the mesh. Second, for solving Poisson problems with highly variable piecewise constant coefficients, we introduce a subdomain-based criterion that recommends stopping when the norm of the linear system residual restricted to each subdomain is smaller than the corresponding indicator also restricted to that subdomain. Reliability and efficiency theorems for the first criterion are established. Numerical experiments, including tests with highly variable piecewise constant coefficients and a GPU-accelerated three-dimensional elliptic solver, demonstrate that the proposed criteria efficiently avoid both premature termination and oversolving.},

Moreover, algorithms to compute the velocity, pressure, and vorticity fields as a postprocess of the discrete stream function are proposed. Furthermore, we provide a comparison between our methods and other numerical schemes in terms of computational standpoint, which indicates that the stream function virtual element formulation is an attractive, efficient, and competitive alternative to solve the Navier–Stokes system.

It is known that any real coordinate transformation (RCT) to compress waves in an unbounded domain into a bounded domain results in infinite oscillations that cannot be resolved by any grid-based method. In this paper, we intend to show that it is viable if the outgoing waves are compressed along the radial direction and the resulting oscillatory pattern is extracted explicitly. We therefore construct a perfectly matched layer-type technique for domain reduction of wave scattering problems using RCT, termed as real compressed layer (RCL). Unlike many existing approaches, the RCT transforms the slow, algebraically decaying factor of the outgoing wave into one that decays exponentially fast, and the layer is not “artificial” in the sense that the computed field in the layer can recover the outgoing wave of the original scattering problem in the unbounded domain. Here we demonstrate the essential idea and performance of the RCL for the two-dimensional Helmholtz problem with a bounded scatterer, but this technique can be extended to three dimensions in a similar setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Model order reduction provides low-complexity high-fidelity surrogate models that allow rapid and accurate solutions of parametric differential equations. The development of reduced order models for parametric nonlinear Hamiltonian systems is challenged by several factors: (i) the geometric structure encoding the physical properties of the dynamics; (ii) the slowly decaying Kolmogorov -width of conservative dynamics; (iii) the gradient structure of the nonlinear flow velocity; (iv) high variations in the numerical rank of the state as a function of time and parameters. We propose to address these aspects via a structure-preserving adaptive approach that combines symplectic dynamical low-rank approximation with adaptive gradient-preserving hyper-reduction and parameters sampling. Additionally, we propose varying in time the dimensions of both the reduced basis space and the hyper-reduction space by monitoring the quality of the reduced solution via an error indicator related to the projection error of the Hamiltonian vector field. The resulting adaptive hyper-reduced models preserve the geometric structure of the Hamiltonian flow, do not rely on prior information on the dynamics, and can be solved at a cost that is linear in the dimension of the full order model and linear in the number of test parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performances of the fully adaptive models compared to the original and reduced models.},

Let us mention Radau5, which is based on the three-stage Radau IIA collocation method, and its extension to problems with discrete delays, Radar5. The aim of the present work is to present a technique that permits a direct application of these codes to problems having a right-hand side with an additional distributed delay term (which is a special case of an integro-differential equation). Models with distributed delays are of increasing importance in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics for the study of the interaction between drugs and the body. The main idea is to approximate the distribution kernel of the integral term by a sum of exponential functions or by a quasi-polynomial expansion and then to transform the distributed (integral) delay term into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This set is typically stiff, and, for some distribution kernels (e.g., Pareto distribution), it contains discrete delay terms with constant delay. The original equations augmented by this set of ODEs can have a very large dimension, and a careful treatment of the solution of the arising linear systems is necessary. The use of the codes Radau5 and Radar5 is illustrated with three examples (two test equations and one problem taken from pharmacodynamics). The driver programs for these examples are publicly available from the home pages of the authors.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We develop an optimization-based algorithm for parametric model order reduction (PMOR) of linear time-invariant dynamical systems. Our method aims at minimizing the approximation error in the frequency and parameter domain by an optimization of the reduced order model (ROM) matrices. State-of-the-art PMOR methods often compute several nonparametric ROMs for different parameter samples, which are then combined to a single parametric ROM. However, these parametric ROMs can have a low accuracy between the utilized sample points. In contrast, our optimization-based PMOR method minimizes the approximation error across the entire parameter domain. Moreover, due to our flexible approach of optimizing the system matrices directly, we can enforce favorable features, such as a port-Hamiltonian structure, in our ROMs across the entire parameter domain. Our method is an extension of the recently developed structured optimization-based model order reduction algorithm to parametric systems. We extend both the ROM parameterization and the adaptive sampling procedure to the parametric case. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of our method in comparison with other PMOR methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many significant differential equations, including ordinary differential equations with a first integral (or Lyapunov function), Hamiltonian systems, Poisson systems, and dissipative systems, can be formulated as “linear-gradient systems.” Geometric integration aims to develop numerical integrators that preserve key properties of continuous systems, such as symplecticity for Hamiltonian systems and energy dissipation for dissipative systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of geometric integrators for linear-gradient systems by incorporating a dimension-extended technique. By introducing a vector-valued function, the original linear-gradient system is transformed into an equivalent system in an extended space. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the numerical solution of the extended system serves as a reliable approximation of the original system and can retain its essential conservative properties. In this dimension-extended framework, the newly derived methods can equivalently recover well-known numerical schemes such as quadratic auxiliary variable methods and energy quadratization methods. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the accuracy, efficiency, and long-term stability of our proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies a family of convolution quadratures, a numerical technique for efficient evaluation of convolution integrals. We employ the block generalized Adams method to discretize the underlying initial value problem, departing from the well-established approaches that rely on linear multistep formulas or Runge–Kutta methods. The convergence order of the proposed convolution quadrature can be changed without requiring grid point adjustments, enhancing flexibility. Through strategic selection of the local interpolation polynomial and block size, the method achieves high-order convergence for calculation of convolution integrals with hyperbolic kernels. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed convolution quadrature and numerically validate our theoretical findings by calculating a range of convolution integrals.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze a class of energy-stable and linearly well-balanced numerical schemes dedicated to the nonlinear shallow water equations with the Coriolis force. The proposed algorithms rely on colocated finite-difference approximations formulated on Cartesian geometries. They involve appropriate diffusion terms in the numerical fluxes, expressed as discrete versions of the linear geostrophic equilibrium. We show that the resulting methods ensure semidiscrete energy estimates. Among the proposed algorithms, a colocated finite-volume scheme is described. Numerical results show a very clear improvement around the nonlinear geostrophic equilibrium when compared to those of classic Godunov-type schemes.},
