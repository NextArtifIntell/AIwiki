  abstract     = {Abstract. Identifying parameters in nonlinear dynamical systems, based solely on observational time series data, is of paramount importance to modeling, understanding, and predicting complex systems. While the adaptive synchronization technique has been successfully used for various identification tasks in the existing literature, its rigorousness hinges crucially on the prerequisite of the linear independence (LI) behaviors of the data converging to the limit set or attractor. This prerequisite is not always satisfied in real applications, since only the short-term data of transient dynamics produced by the systems under consideration is available. Here, to conquer this challenge, we introduce an iteratively adaptive framework designed to operate efficiently on short-term data of transient dynamics. We conduct theoretical analysis to demonstrate its rigorousness, and we offer a few representative examples from toy models to a real-world dataset to illustrate its practical usefulness and efficacy. In particular, an introduction of deliberately designed control or random perturbations renders the LI behaviors more attainable solely on transient dynamics. Consequently, successful identification of a substantial number of parameters in complex systems using short-term data becomes achievable, which significantly broadens the potential application scenarios of our work.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent clinical studies provide strong evidence that adaptive tumor therapy is a promising threshold policy-guided periodic and intermittent treatment for prolonging treatment efficacy particularly for prostate cancer, despite the observed tumor size fluctuations in the patients. Understanding plausible patterns of tumor size fluctuations under different treatment scenarios is important to evaluate the therapy outcomes. Here we use state-of-the-art modeling and analytic frameworks of periodic switching systems and state-dependent switching systems to develop a dynamic model that mimics the adaptive therapy, and we describe dynamical behaviors of the model system with a particular focus on the patterns of periodic fluctuation. Under the threshold policy, patients may not be given therapies during the a priori treatment period. We show that this threshold-guided treatment will give rise to a new type of periodic solutions with complex structures, characterized as -periodic solutions. We examine, both theoretically and numerically, the existence, as well as the local and global stability of such periodic solutions, including the boundary periodic solutions with one vanished compartment and positive -periodic solutions. It is hoped this study also shows the great potential in developing a class of models to describe threshold-triggered periodic and intermittent control in many fields, which in turn may generate many new dynamic behaviors of nonsmooth dynamic systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Optimal transport has been an essential tool for reconstructing dynamics from complex data. With the increasingly available multifaceted data, a system can often be characterized across multiple spaces. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain coherence in the dynamics across these diverse spaces. To address this challenge, we introduce synchronized optimal transport (SyncOT), a novel approach to jointly model dynamics that represent the same system through multiple spaces. Given the correspondence between the spaces, SyncOT minimizes the aggregated cost of the dynamics induced across all considered spaces. The problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional convex problem using a staggered grid. Primal-dual algorithm-based approaches are then developed to solve the discretized problem. Various numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities and properties of SyncOT and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

We use the Wigner transformation and asymptotic analysis to systematically derive the semiclassical model for the Schrödinger equation in arbitrary spatial dimensions, with any periodic structure. Our particular emphasis lies in addressing the diabatic effect, i.e., the impact of Bloch band crossings. We consider both deterministic and random scenarios. In the former case, we derive a coupled Liouville system, revealing lower-order interactions among different Bloch bands. In the latter case, a coupled system of radiative transport equations emerges, with the scattering cross section induced by the random inhomogeneities. As a specific application, we deduce the effective dynamics of a wave packet in graphene with randomness.},

Multi-species BGK models describe the dynamics of rarefied gases with constituent particles of different elements or compounds with potentially nontrivial velocity distributions. In this paper, moment equations for the bulk velocities, energies, and temperatures of a spatially homogeneous multi-species BGK model are examined. A key challenge in analyzing these equations is the fact that the collision frequencies are allowed to depend on the species temperatures, which allows for more realistic simulations of dilute gas flow. Therefore, a positive lower bound is established for the species temperatures. With this lower bound, a global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled velocity-energy ODE system is established. The lower bound also enables a proof of exponential decay to a unique steady-state solution. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate how the bulk velocities and temperatures relax for large times.},

Solving the stationary nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations is important in applications and examples include the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and the two-layer neural networks. Making use of the connection between the interacting particle systems and the nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations, we propose solving the stationary solution by sampling from the -body Gibbs distribution. This avoids simulation of the -body system for a long time and the requirement of uniform propagation of chaos from direct simulation of the particle systems. While the sampling strategy could be used for any given temperature, we establish the convergence of the Gibbs measure to the stationary solution when the interaction kernel is bounded (not necessarily continuous) and the temperature is high enough. Numerical experiments are performed for the Poisson–Boltzmann equation and the two-layer neural networks to validate the method and the theory.},

It was a simple forward substitution method based on a two-dimensional Zernike basis.

The method is likewise a forward substitution, hence making it very efficient to numerically implement. Moreover, the three-dimensional method only makes use of a relatively small subset of boundary measurements for exact reconstruction compared to a full basis of current densities.},

To that end, we consider an extension of the one-dimensional Klausmeier model that accounts for the toxicity compounds. Numerical simulations are first conducted to capture the qualitative behaviors of the pulse–type solutions and, then, geometric singular perturbation theory is used to prove the existence of such traveling pulses by constructing the corresponding homoclinic orbits in the associated four-dimensional system. A scaling analysis on the investigated model is performed to identify the asymptotic scaling regime in which traveling pulses can be constructed. Interestingly, due to the autotoxicity extension, the use of geometric blowup techniques can be avoided, in contrast with previous work [P. Carter and A. Doelman, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 78 (2023), pp. 3213–3237]. Some biological observations are extracted from the analytical results and the role of autotoxicity in traveling patterns is emphasized. Finally, the analytically constructed solutions are compared with the numerical ones, leading to a good agreement that confirms the validity of the conducted analysis. Numerical investigations are also carried out in order to gain additional information on vegetation dynamics.},

The problem of finding the fastest out of such events to occur is called an extreme first passage time. The rare event times are singular and limit to infinity as a positive parameter scaling the noise magnitude is reduced to zero. In contrast, previous work has shown that the mean of the fastest event time goes to zero in the limit of an infinite number of walkers. The combined limit is studied. In particular, the mean time and the most likely path taken by the fastest random walker are investigated. Using techniques from large deviation theory, it is shown that there is a distinguished limit where the mean time for the fastest walker can take any positive value, depending on a single proportionality constant. Furthermore, it is shown that the mean time and most likely path can be approximated using the solution to a variational problem related to the single-walker rare event.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many transport processes in ecology, physics, and biochemistry can be described by the average time to first find a site or exit a region, starting from an initial position. Typical mathematical treatments are based on formulations that allow for various diffusive forms and geometries but where only initial and final positions are taken into account. Here we develop a general theory for the mean first passage time (MFPT) for velocity jump processes. For random walkers, both position and velocity are tracked and the resulting Fokker–Planck equation takes the form of a kinetic transport equation. Starting from the forward and backward formulations we derive a general elliptic integro-PDE for the MFPT of a random walker starting at a given location with a given velocity. We focus on two scenarios that are relevant to biological modeling; the diffusive case and the anisotropic case. For the anisotropic case we also perform a parabolic scaling, leading to a well-known anisotropic MFPT equation. To illustrate the results we consider a two-dimensional circular domain under radial symmetry, where the MFPT equations can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, we consider the MFPT of a random walker in an ecological habitat that is perturbed by linear features, such as wolf movement in a forest habitat that is crossed by seismic lines.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The cancer microenvironment is increasingly being viewed as an ecosystem, in which tumor cells interact with surrounding cells through diverse ecological relationships. However, the ecological principles governing the dynamics of cancer development and progression remain a mystery, hindering efforts to develop better treatment strategies. Here, we propose a novel ecological network of “predation-mutualism-amensalism” among tumor cells, immune cells, and mutualist cells. We found that this ecological model can accurately recapitulate the dynamic states and their transitions during cancer immunoediting by integrating mathematical modeling, stability and bifurcation analysis, and validation using experiment data. In contrast, two current models that only described predation and amensalism interactions failed to achieve it, suggesting the essential contribution of mutualism to the evolution of cancer immunoediting. Further, the immune barrier as a quantitative index was exploited to investigate the interlinkages between ecological relationships and cancer progression. Surprisingly, we found that the mutualism-mediated and amensalism-mediated inhibition of antitumor immune response only affects the transition from dormancy to escape phase, while the predation-mediated antitumor immune response affects all the phase transition dynamics of cancer progression. Moreover, by constructing the solution landscape of cancer progression dynamics, we revealed that tumor cell migration enables cancer progression to enter the dormancy phase by evading immunosurveillance, while mutualist cell migration facilitates the tumor’s evasion from dormancy to escape phase. The discovery of these ecological principles and the understanding of cell motility within the cancer microenvironment provide a potential for improved intervention of ecological interactions that could impact cancer progression and treatment.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent experiments discovered fractional Chern insulator states at zero magnetic field in twisted bilayer MoTe [Cai et al., Nature, 622 (2023), pp. 63–68; Zeng et al., Nature, 622 (2023), pp. 69–73] and WSe [Morales-Durán et al., Phys. Rev. Res., 5 (2023), L032022]. In this article, we study the MacDonald Hamiltonian for twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and analyze the low-lying spectrum in TMDs in the limit of small twisting angles. Unlike in twisted bilayer graphene Hamiltonians, we show that TMDs do not exhibit flat bands. The flatness in TMDs for small twisting angles is due to spatial confinement by a matrix-valued potential. We show that by generalizing semiclassical techniques developed by Simon [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré, 38 (1983), pp. 295–307] and Helffer and Sjöstrand [Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 9 (1984), pp. 337–408] to matrix-valued potentials, there exists a wide range of model parameters such that the low-lying bands are of exponentially small width in the twisting angle, are topologically trivial, and obey a harmonic oscillator type of spacing with explicit parameters.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the convergence of kinetic Langevin dynamics to its ergodic invariant measure, which is Gibbs distribution. Instead of the standard setup where the friction coefficient is a constant scalar, we investigate the position-dependent friction coefficient and the possible accelerated convergence it enables. We show that by choosing this coefficient matrix to be , convergence is accelerated in the sense that no constant scalar friction coefficient can lead to faster convergence for a large subset of (nonlinear) strongly convex potential ’s. The speed of convergence is quantified in terms of Chi-square divergence from the target distribution and proved using a Lyapunov approach, based on viewing sampling as optimization in the infinite dimensional space of probability distributions.},
