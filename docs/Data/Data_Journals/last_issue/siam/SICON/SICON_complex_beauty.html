  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of quantum feedback control in creating desired states for atomic and photonic systems utilizing a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this approach, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, and the photon can be reflected by either the terminal mirror of the waveguide or other atoms, establishing various feedback loops through the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are no more than two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be effectively elucidated through the lens of random graph theory. However, this process is influenced by the environment. We propose that the environment-induced dynamics in the coherent feedback loop can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Consequently, in the atom-waveguide interactions in open quantum systems, measurement-based feedback has the potential to modulate the quantum steady states. Additionally, the homodyne detection noise during the measurement process can induce errors upon quantum states, which can be influenced by the coherent feedback parameter designs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper considers a risk-sensitive optimal control problem for a field-mediated interconnection of a quantum plant with a coherent (measurement-free) quantum controller. The plant and the controller are multimode open quantum harmonic oscillators governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations, which are coupled to each other and driven by multichannel quantum Wiener processes modeling the external bosonic fields. The control objective is to internally stabilize the closed-loop system and minimize the infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rate of a quadratic-exponential functional which penalizes the plant variables and the controller output. We obtain first-order necessary conditions of optimality for this problem by computing the partial Fréchet derivatives of the cost functional with respect to the energy and coupling matrices of the controller in the frequency domain and state space. An infinitesimal equivalence between the risk-sensitive and weighted coherent quantum LQG control problems is also established. In addition to variational methods, we employ spectral factorizations and infinite cascades of auxiliary classical systems. Their truncations are applicable to numerical optimization algorithms (such as the gradient descent) for coherent quantum risk-sensitive feedback synthesis.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that a spectrum connected by conical intersections which do not pile up yields exact controllability in finite dimension and approximate controllability in infinite dimension. Actually, the property that intersections between eigenvalues are conical and that they do not pile up is generic. However, in physical situations, due to symmetry of the system, the spectrum can exhibit intersections that are not conical and possibly pile up. We extend the controllability result to cover these types of situations under the hypothesis that the intersections have at least one conical direction and the piled-up intersections have “rationally unrelated germs.” Finally, we provide a testable first-order sufficient condition for controllability. Physically relevant examples are provided.},

In addition, we prove boundedness in mean of the solutions of perturbed systems under open-loop protocols. For the feedback strategies, in the general case without assumptions on invariance, we provide bounds on the perturbation effect in expectation and in probability, as well as specific bounds for nondemolition nominal systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The robust manipulation of ensembles of quantum systems exhibiting variations or uncertainties in the system parameters and dynamics has been a long-standing problem in the field of quantum control. Existing methods for addressing quantum ensemble control primarily rely on the use of state-space models that describe the time evolution of quantum states. In this paper, we introduce a distinctive quantum control paradigm by mapping the quantum ensemble control problem to a dual problem defined on a coordinate system established by a moment transform. This transformation introduces a new type of quantization in quantum systems, enabling tractable systems-theoretic analysis and effective optimal control design, which are typically opaque. Subsequently, we develop an iterative computational algorithm to solve the transformed optimal moment control problems. We conduct a convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness on various challenging pulse design problems in quantum control.},

The dynamical Lie algebra , which determines the controllability properties of the system, is a Lie subalgebra of such a Lie algebra .

In detail, we study when it is possible to control the dynamics of NLS as fast as desired via sufficiently large control signals and . We first show the existence of a family of quantum states for which this property is verified: this extends to the validity of a small-time control property recently shown on by the first author and Nersesyan, and on by Chambrion and the second author. Second, by considering some specific states belonging to this family, as a physical consequence we show the capability of controlling arbitrary changes of energy in bounded regions of the quantum system, in time zero. Our results are proved by exploiting the idea that the nonlinear term in NLS is only a perturbation of the linear problem when the time is as small as desired. The core of the proof, then, is the controllability of the bilinear equation which is tackled by using specific noncommutativity properties of infinite-dimensional propagators.},

In the present paper, we study its local exact controllability near the ground state in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions. To establish the controllability of the linearized equation, we use a bilinear control acting through four directions: three Fourier modes and one generic direction. The Fourier modes are appropriately chosen so that they satisfy a saturation property. These modes allow one to control approximately the linearzied Schrödinger equation. Then we show that the reachable set for the linearized equation is closed. This is achieved by representing the solution operator as a sum of two linear continuous mappings: one is surjective (here the control in generic direction is used) and the other is compact. A mapping with dense and closed image is surjective, so we conclude that the linearized Schrödinger equation is exactly controllable. The local exact controllability of the nonlinear equation then follows by the inverse mapping theorem.},

We introduce cooperative nonpersistent excitation conditions to reflect the temporal and spatial union information condition, under which the almost sure convergence of the proposed distributed algorithm is established.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate the expressive power of deep residual neural networks idealized as continuous dynamical systems through control theory. Specifically, we consider two properties that arise from supervised learning, namely universal interpolation—the ability to match arbitrary input and target training samples—and the closely related notion of universal approximation—the ability to approximate input-target functional relationships via flow maps. Under the assumption of affine invariance of the control family, we give a characterization of universal interpolation, showing that it holds for essentially any architecture with nonlinearity. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationship between universal interpolation and universal approximation in the context of general control systems, showing that the two properties cannot be deduced from each other. At the same time, we identify conditions on the control family and the target function that ensure the equivalence of the two notions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article focuses on a type of mean-field stochastic differential equation driven by G-Brownian motion (G-MFSDEs for short). We obtain the well-posedness of G-MFSDEs by truncating their space and distribution variables to obtain an Euler-like sequence, and then prove the Euler-like sequence to be a Cauchy sequence. G-Brownian motion and distribution dependence which is defined via the G-expectation prevent us from directly applying the stability analysis techniques developed for G-SDEs and MFSDEs to G-MFSDEs. To overcome these difficulties, we establish the G-Itô formula for G-MFSDEs, then, using this as our basis, we investigate the moment exponential stability and the global stability in probability of G-MFSDEs. We also stabilize an unstable G-MFSDE by adding a discrete-time state observation feedback control into the drift coefficient. Two examples are presented to check our theory results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper investigates asymptotic stabilization for heritable logical control networks (HLCNs). A pioneering method is proposed to deal with heritable hidden information, a stochastic temporal sequence that unavoidably exists in many practical controllers. To capture such information, a gated recurrent unit structure is introduced, in which the gate mechanism is modeled by a Markovian sampling process. Based on that, the semitensor product is applied to formulate the system as a switched LCN with a time-varying dimension. Then, the matrix expansion technique is employed to unify the dimension, and necessary and sufficient criteria for asymptotic stabilization are derived in two typical cases of the heritable hidden information. All of these criteria can be implemented using a newly proposed algorithm that is applicable to general cases. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical results.},

These equations can, for example, model the growth of an ecosystem under uncertainty. We first explore some fundamental properties of such linear SPDEs. Next, utilizing time-space white noise calculus, we derive both Pontryagin-type necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the control. Finally, we illustrate our results by solving a linear-quadratic control problem and examining an optimal harvesting problem in the plane.

Besides its independent interest, the previous result plays a crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate by finite and increasing-in-size sets for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the -limiting problem.

Our results are based on the Koopman operator approach, and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution to an open problem within that framework. By focusing on the adjoint of the Koopman generator in the Hardy space on the polydisk (or on the real hypercube), we define equivalent linear (but infinite-dimensional) switched systems, and we construct a common Lyapunov functional for those systems, under a solvability condition of the Lie algebra generated by the linearized vector fields. A common Lyapunov function for the original switched nonlinear systems is derived from the Lyapunov functional by exploiting the reproducing kernel property of the Hardy space. The Lyapunov function is shown to converge in a bounded region of the state space, which proves global uniform stability of specific switched nonlinear systems on bounded invariant sets.},

At one end of the space interval, there is a reflecting boundary condition. At the other end a stabilizing feedback law with a varying time-delay is prescribed. We present sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the system. We show that exponential stabilization is possible if the product of the length of the interval and an upper bound for the source term is sufficiently small. We also show that if the product of the length of the interval and a lower bound for the source term is sufficiently large, the system is unstable. Our analysis is based on Lyapunov functions with weights that are given by hyperbolic functions that generalize the well-known exponential weights. Compared with previous contributions, we obtain conditions that can be verified more easily in terms of the system parameters. Our results show that for sufficiently short space intervals, and also with varying time-delay, exponential stabilization is possible with appropriately chosen feedback gains that depend on the maximal value of the time-delay and the maximal absolute value of its derivative.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Norm-optimal iterative learning control (NOILC) is effective for repetitive systems in achieving the monotonic decrease of the tracking error with respect to a specified trajectory. However, for classical NOILC, the model information is required, which contradicts the essential data-based characteristic for iterative learning control. Inspired by this contradiction, the current paper aims to establish a data-based design and analysis framework for NOILC, focusing on uncertain linear systems without system constraints. A Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based approach is leveraged to develop a virtual input-output relationship from only the collected system data, with which the design of NOILC can be accomplished without any model information. The monotonic convergence analysis of the proposed GPR-based NOILC is implemented such that the robust tracking task can be achieved in the presence of iteration-varying initial state shifts and disturbances, and the boundedness of all system trajectories can be ensured simultaneously. An example is also included to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the presented GPR-based NOILC methods.},

The conditions imposed imply that the time-varying vector field is almost periodic, so that in particular the time average of defines the time-homogeneous mean vector field , and the goal then is to find the root solving . The primary contribution on which other results are based is the perturbative mean flow representation: in which are identified as functionals of a state process. The representation is based on the application of techniques from Markov processes, for which Poisson’s equation plays a central role. This new representation, combined with new conditions for ultimate boundedness, has many applications for furthering the theory of QSA and its applications, including a proof that the estimation error is of order , but can be reduced to using a second order linear filter.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we develop a space semidiscretized numerical scheme, rooted in the order reduction finite difference method, to uniformly and exponentially approximate the dynamics of an axially moving Euler–Bernoulli beam system under nonlinear boundary feedback control. This systematic approach encompasses the Euler–Bernoulli beam and wave equation under nonlinear boundary control as special cases. The feedback mechanism incorporates a nonlinear function that adheres to a sector condition, thus encompassing a diverse array of nonlinear feedback scenarios. The exponential stability and well-posedness of the continuous system are rigorously established through the application of integral inequality and nonlinear semigroup theory. Parallel to this, we demonstrate that the discrete systems, resulting from our numerical scheme, maintain uniform exponential stability with respect to the discrete step size. This conclusion is reached utilizing the discrete multiplier technique in conjunction with the integral inequality method, mirroring the analysis for the continuous counterpart. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme, reinforcing its applicability in simulating and analyzing the behavior of the axially moving Euler–Bernoulli beam system under nonlinear boundary feedback control.},

Suppose that the signal-to-noise ratio (defined as the difference between the two possible drifts divided by the diffusion coefficient) is nonconstant. Given an initial state for the observed process, we consider a minimax formulation of the Wiener sequential testing problem for detecting the correct drift coefficient as soon as possible and with minimal probabilities of incorrect terminal decisions. We solve the problem in the Bayesian formulation, under any prior probabilities of the process having drift or , when the waiting time is penalized linearly. In the case where the signal-to-noise ratio is assumed constant, we obtain an explicit formula for the least favorable distribution.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we solve an open problem and obtain a general maximum principle for a stochastic optimal control problem where the control domain is an arbitrary nonempty set and all the coefficients (especially the diffusion term and the terminal cost) contain the control and state delay. In order to overcome the difficulty of dealing with the cross term of state and its delay in the variational inequality, we propose a new method: transform a delayed variational equation into a Volterra integral equation without delay inspired by [Y. Hamaguchi, Appl. Math. Optim., 87 (2023), 42], and introduce novel first-order, second-order adjoint equations via the backward stochastic Volterra integral equation theory established in [T. Wang and J. Yong, SIAM J. Control Optim., 61 (2023), pp. 3608–3634]. Finally we express these two kinds of adjoint equations in more compact anticipated backward stochastic differential equation types for several special yet typical control systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The paper addresses the problem of analysis and control synthesis for an unknown Boolean control network (BCN) using only input-state data obtained from this BCN. Since in general the data may not determine the unknown BCN uniquely, such a problem cannot be approached by means of system identification combined with model-based analysis/control. Instead, we use the concept of informativity, which investigates the whole set of BCNs that explain the given data. An analysis/synthesis problem is then naturally solved for the unknown BCN if it is solved for all BCNs in this set. As such, we formulate necessary and sufficient conditions on the given data to be informative for a range of control analysis and synthesis problems. Also, explicit data-dependent formulas to compute control laws are given when the proposed informativity conditions are met. Examples are presented to show that, as expected, the obtained results are useful in situations where the measured data do not contain sufficient information to identify the unknown BCN.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we study the mean field Schrödinger problem from a purely probabilistic point of view by exploiting its connection to stochastic control theory for McKean–Vlasov diffusions. Our motivation is to study scenarios in which mean field Schrödinger problems arise as the limit of “standard” Schrödinger problems over interacting particles. Due to the stochastic maximum principle and a suitable penalization procedure, the result follows as a consequence of novel (quantitative) propagation of chaos results for forward-backward particle systems. The approach described in the paper seems flexible enough to address other questions in the theory. For instance, our stochastic control technique further allows us to solve the mean field Schrödinger problem and characterize its solution, the mean field Schrödinger bridge, by a forward-backward planning equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Higher order necessary conditions for a minimizer of an optimal control problem—in particular, Goh and Legendre–Clebsch-type conditions—are generally obtained for systems whose dynamics is at least continuously differentiable in the state variable. Here, by making use of the notion of set-valued Lie bracket introduced in [F. Rampazzo and H. J. Sussmann, in Proceedings of the 40th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, Vol. 3, 2001, pp. 2613–2618] and extended in [E. Feleqi and F. Rampazzo, NoDEA Nonlinear Differential Equations Appl., 24 (2017), 61], we obtain Goh and Legendre–Clebsch-type conditions for a control affine system with locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics. In order to manage the simultaneous lack of smoothness of the adjoint equation and of the Lie bracket–like variations, we will exploit the notion of Quasi Differential Quotient, introduced in [M. Palladino and F. Rampazzo, [J. Differential Equations, 269 (2020), pp. 10107–10142]. We finally exhibit an example where the established higher order condition is capable of ruling out the optimality of a control verifying a first order Maximum Principle.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we consider singular linear Volterra integral control system with quadratic cost functional over the infinite time horizon. When the coefficients are time-varying matrices, the existence of the solution to the mentioned control system is first proved and the solution can be represented by the Volterra integral where the properties of the kernel function are developed, and then the characterization of the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control under proper conditions is explored by maximum principle type necessary conditions. When the coefficients are constant matrices, the singular Volterra integral equation is reduced to the classical Caputo fractional system. In such cases, using the Mittag-Leffler matrix function and its properties, we show that if , the finiteness of the cost functional implies the initial value must be equal to zero, which results in there being no optimal control whence the initial value is not zero, while the cost functional must be finite if . Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control for is characterized, and based on this characterization, an additional interesting finding that the optimal control for linear quadratic optimal control of the fractional system cannot be obtained by linear feedback with a constant gain satisfying an algebraic Riccati equation is concluded.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we present an impulse response identification scheme that incorporates the internal positivity side-information of the system. The realization theory of positive systems establishes specific criteria for the existence of a positive realization for a given transfer function. These transfer function criteria are translated to a set of suitable conditions on the shape and structure of the impulse responses of positive systems. Utilizing these conditions, the impulse response estimation problem is formulated as a constrained optimization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space equipped with a stable kernel, and suitable constraints are imposed to encode the internal positivity side-information. The optimization problem is infinite-dimensional with an infinite number of constraints. An equivalent finite-dimensional convex optimization in the form of a convex quadratic program is derived. The resulting equivalent reformulation makes the proposed approach suitable for numerical simulation and practical implementation. A Monte Carlo numerical experiment evaluates the impact of incorporating the internal positivity side-information in the proposed identification scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using data from a heating system experiment.},
