  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we study the satisfiability and solutions of group equations when combinatorial, algebraic, and language-theoretic constraints are imposed on the solutions. We show that the solutions to equations with length, lexicographic order, abelianization, or context-free constraints added can be effectively produced in finitely generated virtually abelian groups. Crucially, we translate each of the constraints above into a rational set in an effective way, and so reduce each problem to solving equations with rational constraints, which is decidable and well understood in virtually abelian groups. A byproduct of our results is that the growth series of a virtually abelian group, with respect to any generating set and any weight, is effectively computable. This series is known to be rational by the work of Benson [Invent. Math., 73 (1983), pp. 251–269], but his approach is not constructive.},

Power sum decomposition entails writing forms of degree as a sum of th powers of -forms.

Semidefinite programming is used to perform this reduction. The semidefinite programming approach allows us to improve the currently best known rank bounds for the problem from to , in a typical case. An implementation of the algorithm is provided.

We present a necessary and sufficient condition for reduced bounded motion polynomials to admit factorizations into monic linear factors, and we give an algorithm to compute them. We can use those linear factors to construct mechanisms because the factorization corresponds to the decomposition of the rational motion into simple rotations or translations. Bounded motion polynomials always admit a factorization into linear factors after multiplying with a suitable real or quaternion polynomial. Our criterion for factorizability allows us to improve on earlier algorithms to compute a suitable real or quaternion polynomial co-factor.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is well known that the densest lattice sphere packings also typically have large kissing numbers. The sphere packing density maximization problem is known to have a solution among well-rounded lattices, of which the integer lattice is the simplest example. The integer lattice is also an example of a generic well-rounded lattice, i.e., a well-rounded lattice with a minimal kissing number. However, the integer lattice has the worst density among well-rounded lattices. In this paper, the problem of constructing explicit generic well-rounded lattices with dense sphere packings is considered. To this end, so-called tame lattices recently introduced by Damir and Mantilla-Soler are utilized. Tame lattices came to be as a generalization of the ring of integers of certain abelian number fields. The sublattices of tame lattices constructed in this paper are shown to always result in either a generic well-rounded lattice or the lattice , with density ranging between that of and . In order to find generic well-rounded lattices with densities beyond that of , explicit deformations of some known densest lattice packings are constructed, yielding a family of generic well-rounded lattices with densities arbitrarily close to the optimum. In addition to being an interesting mathematical problem in its own right, the constructions are also motivated from a more practical point of view. Namely, generic well-rounded lattices with high packing density make good candidates for lattice codes used in secure wireless communications.},

We construct discrete versions of some Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand (BGG) complexes, i.e., the Hessian and the divdiv complexes, on triangulations in two dimensions and three dimensions. The sequences consist of finite elements with local polynomial shape functions and various types of Dirac measures on subsimplices (generalizations of currents). The construction generalizes Whitney forms (canonical conforming finite elements) for the de Rham complex and Regge calculus/finite elements for the elasticity (Riemannian deformation) complex from discrete topological and Discrete Exterior Calculus perspectives. We show that the cohomology of the resulting complexes is isomorphic to the continuous versions, and thus isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology with coefficients.},
