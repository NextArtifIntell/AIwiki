  abstract     = {This article reviews emerging technologies in wireless communication systems, focusing on their key concepts, principles, use cases, and challenges. It examines relevant studies in the telecommunication sector, with a focus on technologies that enhance connectivity, performance, and innovative applications across industries. The review highlights advancements such as fifth-generation (5G) networks, which offer faster data speeds, lower latency, and increased network capacity, enabling the development of applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT devices are increasingly connecting physical objects, driving innovation in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing. Edge computing, by enabling real-time processing and reducing latency, supports IoT applications requiring immediate responses. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being integrated to optimize network resources, improve spectrum management, and facilitate intelligent decision-making. Technologies such as massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) enhance spectral efficiency, network capacity, and interference reduction. Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies are being explored for high-speed wireless communication, enabling multi-gigabit data rates and applications in 5G, wireless backhaul, and ultra-high-definition video streaming. Software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) enable centralized management and greater network flexibility, while beam steering improves signal quality and coverage by directing wireless signals toward specific receivers. Quantum communication, leveraging quantum principles, provides secure communication channels, while quantum key distribution (QKD) ensures data confidentiality. Visible light communication (VLC) utilizes visible light for high-speed data transfer in environments where RF-based communication is not feasible. Despite the potential of these technologies, the article identifies challenges such as limited practical implementation, standardization issues, resource constraints, security and privacy concerns, and sustainability challenges. It concludes by discussing the practical implications of these emerging technologies, including enhanced data transfer speeds, improved network capacity, low-latency communication, IoT connectivity, ubiquitous coverage, industry transformation, and the security and privacy considerations that accompany these advancements.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is being leveraged for multiple tasks in the healthcare sector, such as improving the diagnosis of disease, streamlining management services, and tailoring treatment procedures. Applying predictive analysis and performing robotic surgery helps patients in a way that reduces the burden on their caregivers. This study uses a healthcare disease prediction dataset using three robust machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and support vector classifier (SVC). The models learn to use other symptoms to detect the presence of various diseases. In model evaluation, cross-validation is done on the training set after data preprocessing is performed to ensure none of the groups is overrepresented in the final model. In both the training and the testing of each model, which were respectively 100%, the model was able to make perfect predictions. A vote of three classifiers reached the 100% precision mark over a test dataset on an ensemble model that combined all the classifiers. This research integrates the advances in AI technology into the healthcare setting in a bid to enhance healthcare delivery. Additionally, we created such a straightforward tool in the case of input symptoms and proposed a possible disease diagnosis. This study also adds to the expanding corpus of research on AI in healthcare by providing a practical method for symptom-based diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Forecasts of prices for a wide range of commodities have been a source of confidence for governments and investors throughout history. This study examines the difficult task of forecasting scrap steel prices, which are released every day for the southwest China market, leveraging time-series data spanning August 23, 2013 to April 15, 2021. Estimates have not been fully considered in previous studies for this important commodity price assessment. In this case, cross-validation procedures and Bayesian optimization techniques are used to develop Gaussian process regression strategies, and consequent price projections are built. Arriving at a relative root mean square error of 0.4691%, this empirical prediction approach yields fairly precise price projections throughout the out-of-sample stage spanning September 17, 2019 to April 15, 2021. Through the use of price research models, governments and investors may make well-informed judgments on regional markets of scrap steel.},

  abstract     = {This research proposes a novel ion implantation technique that combines the film delamination method with semiconductor simulation technology to achieve low-dose, high-uniformity semiconductor doping. The method involves depositing a protective layer on the substrate, implanting ions into the layer, performing high-temperature pre-diffusion, delaminating the protective layer, and completing the diffusion process. By integrating semiconductor simulation software, such as Silvaco TCAD, the research aims to optimize parameters for the protective layer and achieve precise control of doping concentrations. This innovative approach addresses the challenges of uniformity and cost in traditional ion implantation equipment.},

  abstract     = {From early industrial prototypes in the 1960s and 1970s to sophisticated systems integrated into contemporary medical practice, healthcare robotics has come a long way in the last 10 years. Human potential has been enhanced by robotics in many ways, most notably in the areas of safety, accuracy, and repeatability. When paired with artificial intelligence (AI), these developments have enormous potential for the healthcare industry in the 21st century. These days, robots help in various places, such as healthcare facilities, assisted living apartments, and rehabilitation centers. For example, Aethon’s TUG robots carry supplies throughout hospitals effectively and lessen the effort of hospital staff. The main applications of healthcare robotics, including telepresence, rehabilitation, and operating rooms, are outlined in this chapter. Giraff and other telepresence robots allow doctors to observe patients from a distance. Hugo TM RAS system from Medtronic has recently garnered notice because of its availability as a modular minimally invasive surgery solution that directly competes with the Da Vinci System in hospitals across the globe. Taking a focus on surgery rooms, telemedicine, and assistive care, this manuscript offers a broad review of the most recent advancements in healthcare robotics. It highlights the difficulties in properly integrating these technologies into the medical field.},
