  abstract     = {The notion of c -differential uniformity was proposed by Ellingsen et al. , which generalizes the classical differential uniformity measuring the resistance against differential cryptanalysis. Since then, the research of functions with low c -differential uniformity over finite fields attracted many researchers’ attention. However, it seems that there is no study of function with low c -differential uniformity over integer rings modulo n . In this paper, we give an extension of the c -differential uniformity concept to rings of integers module some n &gt; 0 , and we present several perfect c -nonlinear polynomial functions on the integer ring ℤ n for the different integer n .},

  abstract     = {The Maximum Independent Set problem is well-studied in graph theory and related areas. An independent set of a graph is a subset of non-adjacent vertices of the graph. A maximum independent set is an independent set of maximum size. This paper studies the Maximum Independent Set problem in some classes of geometric intersection graphs in a distributed setting. More precisely, we study the Maximum Independent Set problem on two geometric intersection graphs, interval and axis-parallel segment intersection graphs, and present deterministic distributed algorithms in a model that is similar but a little weaker than the local communication model. We compute the maximum independent set on interval graphs in O ( k ) rounds and O ( n ) messages, where k is the size of the maximum independent set and n is the number of nodes in the graph. We provide a matching lower bound of Ω ( k ) on the number of rounds, whereas Ω ( n ) is a trivial lower bound on message complexity. Thus, our algorithm is both time and message-optimal. We also study the Maximum Independent Set problem in interval count l graphs, a special case of the interval graphs where the intervals have exactly l different lengths. We propose an 1 2 -approximation algorithm that runs in O ( l ) round. For axis-parallel segment intersection graphs, we design an 1 2 -approximation algorithm that obtains a solution in O ( D ) rounds. The results in this paper extend the results of Molla et al. [J. Parallel Distrib. Comput. 2019].},

The minimal polynomial and the linear complexity of the proposed sequences are determined in most cases under the assumption that r q − 1 ≢ 1 ( mod q 2 ) . The result shows that each of the sequences has large linear complexity.},

  abstract     = {The Wiener index is the sum of distances of all pairs of nodes in a graph; and the Zagreb index is defined as the sum of squares of the degrees of nodes in a rooted tree. In this note, we calculate the first two moments of the Wiener and Zagreb indices of random exponential recursive trees (random ERTs) from two systems of recurrence relations. Then, by an application of the contraction method, we characterize the limit law for a scaled Zagreb index of ERTs. Via the martingale convergence theorem, we also show the almost sure convergence and quadratic mean convergence of an appropriately scaled Wiener index that is indicative of the distance of two randomly chosen nodes.},

The function h is called an outer-independent double Roman dominating function (OIDRDF) if the following conditions are satisfied. The outer-independent double Roman domination number of G is defined by γ o i d R ( G ) = min ∑ v ∈ V h ( v ) : h is an OIDRDF OF G . We prove that the decision problem MOIDRDP, corresponding to γ o i d R ( G ) is NP-complete for split graphs. We also show that it is linear time solvable for connected threshold graphs and bounded treewidth graphs. Finally, we show that the MOIDRDP and domination are not equivalent in computational complexity aspects.},

  abstract     = {The existence of multiple edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (EDHCs for short) is a desirable property of interconnection networks. These parallel cycles can provide an advantage for algorithms that require a ring structure. Additionally, EDHCs can enhance all-to-all data broadcasting and edge fault tolerance in network communications. In this paper, we investigate the construction of EDHCs in the balanced hypercube, which is a variant of the hypercube with many attractive properties, such as strong connectivity, regularity, and symmetry. In particular, each processor in the balanced hypercube has a backup processor that shares the common neighbors, enabling fault tolerance and efficient system reconfiguration. In 2019, Lü et al. provided an algorithm to construct two EDHCs in an n -dimensional balanced hypercube B H n for n ≥ 2 . We further study this topic and give some construction schemes to construct 2 ⌊ log 2 n ⌋ EDHCs in B H n for n ≥ 2 . Since B H n is 2 n -regular, our result is optimal for n = 2 r ( r ≥ 1 ). In addition, we simulate the fault-tolerant data broadcasting through these parallel cycles as transmission channels.},
