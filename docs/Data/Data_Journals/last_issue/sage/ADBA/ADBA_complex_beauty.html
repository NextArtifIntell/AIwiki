  abstract     = {Several research labs around the world have been developing and applying hyperscanning, an innovative methodology that allows to observe what happens in the brains of two or more people when they interact in different social/interpersonal settings. Hyperscanning findings seem to point to the fact that synchronized interbrain activity may be caused by cooperative social interaction, showing that traditionally dominant perspectives about the mind‒brain relation (in particular, supervenience and internalism regarding mental contents) should be revised or replaced by others that adequately integrate the influence of human interactions on the neurobiological underpinnings of cognition (e.g., contextual emergence, externalism regarding mental contents, 4E cognition). This shift would undeniably also have important implications in the fields of mental health (e.g., opening avenues for the design of diagnoses and treatments for social skill conditions) and the social sciences (regarding aspects such as sociocultural interplay, collective decision-making and public participation, social conflict and polarization, interpersonal curiosity, and autonomy).},

  abstract     = {Insightful theoretical and experimental research has shown toroidal representations of entorhinal grid cells working in continuous attractor neural networks. However, this commentary underscores a critical aspect: these toroidal representations do not exist in isolation from the environment within the brain’s neural networks. Instead, they arise as a response to dynamic requirements within the relational context of the task being performed. This view highlights the adaptive nature of these neural representations discussing their emergence based on specific task-related demands rather than as pre-existing, independent neuronal structures.},

  abstract     = {Animals can navigate through complex environments with amazing flexibility and efficiency: they forage over large areas, quickly learning rewarding behavior and changing their plans when necessary. Some insights into the neural mechanisms supporting this ability can be found in the hippocampus (HPC)—a brain structure involved in navigation, learning, and memory. Neuronal activity in the HPC provides a hierarchical representation of space, representing an environment at multiple scales. In addition, it has been observed that when memory-consolidation processes in the HPC are inactivated, animals can still plan and navigate in a familiar environment but not in new environments. Findings like these suggest three useful principles: spatial learning is hierarchical, learning a hierarchical world-model is intrinsically valuable, and action planning occurs as a downstream process separate from learning. Here, we demonstrate computationally how an agent could learn hierarchical models of an environment using off-line replay of trajectories through that environment and show empirically that this allows computationally efficient planning to reach arbitrary goals within a reinforcement learning setting. Using the computational model to simulate hippocampal damage reproduces navigation behaviors observed in rodents with hippocampal inactivation. The approach presented here might help to clarify different interpretations of some spatial navigation studies in rodents and present some implications for future studies of both machine and biological intelligence.},

  abstract     = {The Diverse Intelligence research seeks to understand commonalities in behavioral competencies across a wide range of implementations. Especially interesting are simple systems that provide unexpected examples of memory, decision-making, or problem-solving in substrates that at first glance do not appear to be complex enough to implement such capabilities. We seek to develop tools to determine minimal requirements for such capabilities, and to learn to recognize and predict basal forms of intelligence in unconventional substrates. Here, we apply novel analyses to the behavior of classical sorting algorithms—short pieces of code studied for many decades. To study these sorting algorithms as a model of biological morphogenesis and its competencies, we break two formerly ubiquitous assumptions: top-down control (instead, each element within an array of numbers can exert minimal agency and implement sorting policies from the bottom up), and fully reliable hardware (instead, allowing elements to be “damaged” and fail to execute the algorithm). We quantitatively characterize sorting activity as traversal of a problem space, showing that arrays of autonomous elements sort themselves more reliably and robustly than traditional implementations in the presence of errors. Moreover, we find the ability to temporarily reduce progress in order to navigate around a defect, and unexpected clustering behavior among elements in chimeric arrays consisting of two different algorithms. The discovery of emergent problem-solving capacities in simple, familiar algorithms contributes a new perspective showing how basal forms of intelligence can emerge in simple systems without being explicitly encoded in their underlying mechanics.},

  abstract     = {A core issue of embodiment is the question of how phenomenal and agentive consciousness relates to external forms of behavior. Instead of biasing the question in terms of the “hard problem” as to why and how consciousness arises from brain processes (D. Chalmers), it is suggested to ask for psychophysical correlations in a metaphysically neutral way. This, however, demands (1) to explore both sides of the problem with equivalent precision and depth—not only the physical—and (2) to develop a metaphysically neutral tool to formalize them in a consistent way. Concerning (1), the basic structure of mental micro-activities found in first-person studies on cognitive processes suggests extending the scope of qualia as a mark of consciousness. In the context of Structure Phenomenology (H. Witzenmann), functionally negative phenomenality experienced in ambiguous or meaning-deprived situations and inner agentive qualia of mental activities are correlated with the decompositional signature of sensory-neural processing and synchronized neural oscillations. Concerning (2), G. Günther’s Transclassical Logic is briefly introduced and deployed to integrate the mental, psychophysical, and physical contextures in a three-valued formal framework which also includes enacted and embodied aspects. The emerging picture rebalances first-person and third-person aspects of cognition by functionally separating and dynamically integrating them, thus revitalizing the neurophenomenological research agenda with new experimental proposals and concrete hypotheses.},
