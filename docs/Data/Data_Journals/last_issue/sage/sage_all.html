  abstract     = {Several research labs around the world have been developing and applying hyperscanning, an innovative methodology that allows to observe what happens in the brains of two or more people when they interact in different social/interpersonal settings. Hyperscanning findings seem to point to the fact that synchronized interbrain activity may be caused by cooperative social interaction, showing that traditionally dominant perspectives about the mind‒brain relation (in particular, supervenience and internalism regarding mental contents) should be revised or replaced by others that adequately integrate the influence of human interactions on the neurobiological underpinnings of cognition (e.g., contextual emergence, externalism regarding mental contents, 4E cognition). This shift would undeniably also have important implications in the fields of mental health (e.g., opening avenues for the design of diagnoses and treatments for social skill conditions) and the social sciences (regarding aspects such as sociocultural interplay, collective decision-making and public participation, social conflict and polarization, interpersonal curiosity, and autonomy).},

  abstract     = {Animals can navigate through complex environments with amazing flexibility and efficiency: they forage over large areas, quickly learning rewarding behavior and changing their plans when necessary. Some insights into the neural mechanisms supporting this ability can be found in the hippocampus (HPC)—a brain structure involved in navigation, learning, and memory. Neuronal activity in the HPC provides a hierarchical representation of space, representing an environment at multiple scales. In addition, it has been observed that when memory-consolidation processes in the HPC are inactivated, animals can still plan and navigate in a familiar environment but not in new environments. Findings like these suggest three useful principles: spatial learning is hierarchical, learning a hierarchical world-model is intrinsically valuable, and action planning occurs as a downstream process separate from learning. Here, we demonstrate computationally how an agent could learn hierarchical models of an environment using off-line replay of trajectories through that environment and show empirically that this allows computationally efficient planning to reach arbitrary goals within a reinforcement learning setting. Using the computational model to simulate hippocampal damage reproduces navigation behaviors observed in rodents with hippocampal inactivation. The approach presented here might help to clarify different interpretations of some spatial navigation studies in rodents and present some implications for future studies of both machine and biological intelligence.},

  abstract     = {The Diverse Intelligence research seeks to understand commonalities in behavioral competencies across a wide range of implementations. Especially interesting are simple systems that provide unexpected examples of memory, decision-making, or problem-solving in substrates that at first glance do not appear to be complex enough to implement such capabilities. We seek to develop tools to determine minimal requirements for such capabilities, and to learn to recognize and predict basal forms of intelligence in unconventional substrates. Here, we apply novel analyses to the behavior of classical sorting algorithms—short pieces of code studied for many decades. To study these sorting algorithms as a model of biological morphogenesis and its competencies, we break two formerly ubiquitous assumptions: top-down control (instead, each element within an array of numbers can exert minimal agency and implement sorting policies from the bottom up), and fully reliable hardware (instead, allowing elements to be “damaged” and fail to execute the algorithm). We quantitatively characterize sorting activity as traversal of a problem space, showing that arrays of autonomous elements sort themselves more reliably and robustly than traditional implementations in the presence of errors. Moreover, we find the ability to temporarily reduce progress in order to navigate around a defect, and unexpected clustering behavior among elements in chimeric arrays consisting of two different algorithms. The discovery of emergent problem-solving capacities in simple, familiar algorithms contributes a new perspective showing how basal forms of intelligence can emerge in simple systems without being explicitly encoded in their underlying mechanics.},

  abstract     = {A core issue of embodiment is the question of how phenomenal and agentive consciousness relates to external forms of behavior. Instead of biasing the question in terms of the “hard problem” as to why and how consciousness arises from brain processes (D. Chalmers), it is suggested to ask for psychophysical correlations in a metaphysically neutral way. This, however, demands (1) to explore both sides of the problem with equivalent precision and depth—not only the physical—and (2) to develop a metaphysically neutral tool to formalize them in a consistent way. Concerning (1), the basic structure of mental micro-activities found in first-person studies on cognitive processes suggests extending the scope of qualia as a mark of consciousness. In the context of Structure Phenomenology (H. Witzenmann), functionally negative phenomenality experienced in ambiguous or meaning-deprived situations and inner agentive qualia of mental activities are correlated with the decompositional signature of sensory-neural processing and synchronized neural oscillations. Concerning (2), G. Günther’s Transclassical Logic is briefly introduced and deployed to integrate the mental, psychophysical, and physical contextures in a three-valued formal framework which also includes enacted and embodied aspects. The emerging picture rebalances first-person and third-person aspects of cognition by functionally separating and dynamically integrating them, thus revitalizing the neurophenomenological research agenda with new experimental proposals and concrete hypotheses.},

Furthermore, all essential aspects are integrated with deep learning optimisation, encompassing data normalisation and hybrid learning methodologies to efficiently manage large-scale data, resulting in personalised healthcare solutions. The implementation of the suggested technology in real time addresses the significant disparity between data-driven and healthcare applications, hence facilitating the seamless integration of genetic insights. The contributions are illustrated in real time, and the results are presented through simulation experiments encompassing 4 scenarios and 2 case studies.

  abstract     = {The spinal diseases commonly faced by people in the 19th century included intervertebral disc degeneration, tuberculosis and congenital defects that resulted in neurological impairment and global disability. To address these issues, cervical spine surgery was performed. Modern techniques currently used in spine surgery include interbody devices, pedicle screws, artificial discs and bone grafts. The postoperative complications clinically reported during follow-up include nonunion and implant subsidence, which remain significant drawbacks. The objective of this study is to develop a 3-dimensional finite element model of the C2-C7 cervical spine and validate it against existing experimental studies. The loading conditions considered for this study include a compressive preload of 50 N and a 1 Nm moment applied to the C2 vertebra, with the C7 vertebra fixed at the bottom. In this study, the biomechanical alterations of 4 different cage morphologies were analysed using finite element analysis. Valeo cages with 4 distinct designs were implanted at the C5-C6 level, and physiological motion at the surgical site was studied. Cage subsidence and migration, which can lead to adjacent segment disc degeneration, were also examined. Subsidence was primarily attributed to higher stress encountered in the cage, so stress distribution within the cages was evaluated. Additionally, stress distribution in the anterior plate and screws was analysed. The study concludes that introducing anterior plate and screw fixation helps prevent cage subsidence. Physiological motion at the surgical level was reduced compared to the intact model. Adjacent disc stress was also evaluated and found to be lower than in the intact model.},

  abstract     = {Research on multitask scheduling systems in factory environments is a popular topic in the field of intelligent manufacturing. Existing research mainly focuses on the optimization of automated guided vehicle (AGV) path planning and scheduling, emphasizing on the minimization of conflicts and deadlocks, multi-objective task scheduling, and metaheuristic algorithm optimization, while ignoring path stability and real-time path planning in dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper aims to address these issues to better handle dynamic changes in actual operating environments. This paper establishes a mathematical model with the optimization objective of minimizing the overall running time of material distribution tasks and proposes an improved ant colony algorithm to optimize the model. First, the concept of prior time is introduced to improve the traditional ant colony algorithm. The path of the ongoing task is introduced with a time calculation, and the occupancy time window of each grid point on the path is calculated. Based on this, the initial pheromone distribution on subsequent paths is altered dynamically, which accelerates the convergence of the ants to a collision-free path. Second, in the pheromone update stage, the method of calculating the pheromone increment in the traditional ant colony algorithm is modified. The original distance influence factor is changed to a time influence factor, which ensures that all tasks still have the minimum running time when calculating a collision-free path. Finally, through 30 sets of simulation experiments on material distribution tasks, it is shown that the proposed algorithm shortens the total running time by 15.14%, 12.87%, and 10.59% compared to two ant colony algorithms and one strategic multi-AGV scheduling algorithm, respectively, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The tethered mobile robot with one end fixed to the mother robot or an anchor point has the ability to rappel down steep slopes and traverse rocky terrain, and is a reasonable solution to the above missions. Since the model of the tethered mobile robot can be formulated as a cascade of kinematics and dynamics, a novel backstepping motion control approach is proposed in this paper, in which the kinematic and dynamic controllers are designed independently in a recursive way. In the proposed approach, the optimal distribution of the tether tension and the torque to drive the left and right wheels of the tethered robot is obtained based on the minimization of the system power consumption when the robot traveling on the extreme terrains. In addition, a nonlinear disturbance observer is integrated into the dynamic controller to estimate the disturbance from the rugged terrains.

  abstract     = {This research proposes a unique cable-driven two-degree-of-freedom wrist exoskeleton robotic device for Range of Motion (ROM) exercises related to Carpal Tunnel Recovery (CTR). A transportable platform for hand support powered by two actuators and a nonwearable sensing system comprised the basic, user-friendly design of the proposed exoskeleton robotic device. A specialized assist-as-needed control was installed to make the necessary movements with the robotic device. Transferring the data to the exoskeleton for rehabilitation, the control approach was combined with a computer vision system that imitated the therapist&#39;s wrist motions. Utilizing a computer algorithm, hand landmarks were produced to mimic the therapist&#39;s wrist movements. A total of 20 participants (Male: 55 % and Female: 45 %) were involved in the experimental procedure. High-accuracy ROM readings were obtained: 87.5 % for flexion, 90.0 % for extension, 92.5 % for ulnar deviation, and 90.0 % for radial deviation. In the conventional method, the healthy persons have a ROM for wrist flexion and extension of 71.6° and 63.0°, respectively, but Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) patients have a reduced ROM of 49.4° and 38.9°. Healthy participants have ulnar and radial deviations of 45.6° and 27.0°, respectively, while CTS patients have lower values of 28.7° and 20.1°. Using an exoskeleton, healthy people exhibit ROM flexion and extension of 64.9° and 59.0°, compared to 42.9° and 34.5° in CTS patients. This pattern is also shown in the ulnar and radial deviations, which are 44.1° and 25.6° for healthy individuals and 27.1° and 18.9° for CTS patients, respectively. These findings demonstrated the validity of the measurement techniques, which is crucial for clinical evaluations and rehabilitation plans.},

  abstract = {The kinematic configuration space of a manipulator determines the set of all possible motions that may occur, and its differential properties have a strong, albeit indirect, influence on both static and dynamic performance. By viewing first-order kinematics as a field of Jacobian-defined ellipses across a workspace, a novel two degree-of-freedom manipulator was designed, and is tested in this paper for its benefits. The manipulator exhibits a field of ellipses that biases transmission characteristics in Cartesian directions of the end-effector. The horizontal direction is biased toward speed in order to move across the width of the workspace quickly, while the vertical direction is biased toward force production in order to resist gravitational loads. The latter bias endows the manipulator with load capacity in the absence of gears. Such an exclusion can forego the extra weight, complexity, backlash, transmission losses, and fragility of gearboxes. Additionally, a direct drive set-up improves backdrivability and transparency. The latter is relevant to applications that involve interacting with the environment or people. Our novel design is set through an array of theoretical and experimental performance studies in comparison to a conventional direct drive manipulator. The experimental results showed a 3.75× increase in payload capacity, a 2× increase in dynamic tracking accuracy, a 2.07× increase in dynamic cycling frequency, and at least a 3.70× reduction in power consumption, considering both static and dynamic experiments.},

  abstract = {In the last decades, supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) have been proposed as technological aids for rehabilitation, assistance, and functional augmentation. Whether they are in the form of wearable devices or grounded systems, SRLs can be used to compensate for lost motor functions in patients with disabilities, as well as to augment the human sensorimotor capabilities. By using SRLs, users gain the ability to perform a wide range of complex tasks that may otherwise be challenging or even impossible with their natural limbs. Designing effective strategies and policies for the control and operation of SRLs represents a substantial challenge in their development. A key aspect that remains insufficiently addressed is the formulation of successful and intuitive augmentation policies that do not hinder the functionality of a person’s natural limbs. This work introduces an innovative strategy based on the exploitation of the redundancy of the human kinematic chain involved in a task for commanding SRLs having one degree of freedom. This concept is summarized in the definition of the Intrinsic Kinematic Null Space (IKNS). The newly developed procedure encompasses a real-time analysis of body motion and a subsequent computation of the control signal for SRLs based on the IKNS for single-arm tasks. What sets our approach apart is its explicit emphasis on incorporating user-specific biomechanical and physiological characteristics and constraints. This ensures an efficient and intuitive approach to commanding SRLs, tailored to the individual user’s needs. Towards a complete evaluation of the proposed system, we studied the users’ capability of exploiting the IKNS both in virtual and real environments. Obtained results demonstrated that the exploitation of the Intrinsic Kinematic Null Space allows to perform complex tasks involving both biological and artificial limbs, and that practice improves the ability to accurately manage the coordination of human and supernumerary artificial limbs.},

  abstract = {Independent robotic manipulation of two large permanent magnets, in the form of the dual External Permanent Magnet (dEPM) system has demonstrated the possibility for enhanced magnetic control by allowing for actuation up to eight magnetic degrees of freedom (DOFs) at clinically relevant scales. This precise off-board control has facilitated the use of magnetic agents as medical devices, including catheter-like soft continuum robots (SCRs). The use of multiple robotically actuated permanent magnets poses the risk of collision between the robotic arms, the environment, and the patient. Furthermore, unconstrained transitions between actuation inputs can lead to undesired spikes in magnetic fields potentially resulting in unsafe manipulator deformation. This paper presents a hybrid approach to trajectory planning for the dEPM platform. This is performed by splitting the planning problem in two: first finding a collision-free physical path for the two robotically actuated permanent magnets before combining this with a path in magnetic space , which permits for a smooth change in magnetic fields and gradients. This algorithm was characterized by actuating each of the eight magnetic DOFs sequentially, eliminating any potential collisions and reducing the maximum undesired actuation value by 203.7 mT for fields and by 418.7 mT/m for gradients. The effect of this planned magnetic field actuation on a SCR was then examined through two case studies. First, a tip-driven SCR was moved to set points within a confined area. Actuation using the proposed planner reduced movement outside the restricted area by an average of 41.3%. Lastly, the use of the proposed magnetic planner was shown to be essential in navigating a multi-segment magnetic SCR to the site of an aneurysm within a silicone brain phantom.},

The APN state is incrementally updated to expand a connected configuration space that extends throughout as much of the known space as possible, using efficient difference-awareness techniques that track the discrete changes of the spatial map to inform the updates. A frontier-guided approach is presented for efficient evaluation of information gain and covisible information, which guides view sampling and refinement to ensure maximum coverage of the unmapped space is maintained within the APN. The updated roadmap is hierarchically decomposed into subgraph regions which we use to facilitate a non-myopic global view sequence planner. A comparative analysis to several state-of-the-art approaches was conducted, showing significant performance improvements in terms of total exploration time and surface coverage, and demonstrating high computational efficiency that is scalable to large and complex environments.},

One of the most promising designs regards a new concept of continuum concentric push–pull robots (CPPRs) that have the characteristic of combining several key advantages of tendon actuated, multi-backbone, and concentric tube ones (direct curvature actuation, small outer/inner diameter ratio, free lumen, etc.). Geometrically-exact models of such recently introduced robots are yet to be developed to gain leverage of their full potential. This article extends beyond usual definitions of Cosserat rod theory in order to take into account this new type of continuum robots, constituted by sliding rods, in a shape of tubes whose cross-sections are neither uniform nor symmetrical along their entire length. The introduced model is capable of considering versatile design options, external loads, 3D deformations, an arbitrary number of tubes and profiles of the centroid lines, as well as a new actuation method consisting of an input rotation. Numerical simulations and experiments on CPPR prototypes validate our model.},

This may be in part due to the difficulty in modeling multi-legged motion with slipping and producing reliable predictions of body velocity. Here, we present a detailed measurement of the foot contact forces in a hexapedal robot with multiple sliding contacts, and provide an algorithm for predicting these contact forces and the body velocity. The algorithm relies on the recently published observation that even while slipping, multi-legged robots are principally kinematic, and employ a friction law ansatz that allows us to compute the shape-change to body-velocity connection and the foot contact forces. This results in the ability to simulate motion plans for a large number of contacts, each potentially with slipping. Furthermore, in homogeneous environments, this kind of simulation can run in (parallel) logarithmic time of the planning horizon.},

In this paper, we present a complete provable theory of adaptive multilevel simplification for the setting of a given externally constructed belief tree and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that constructs the belief tree on the fly using an exploration technique. Our theory allows to accelerate POMDP planning with belief-dependent rewards without any sacrifice in the quality of the obtained solution. We rigorously prove each theoretical claim in the proposed unified theory. Using the general theoretical results, we present three algorithms to accelerate continuous POMDP online planning with belief-dependent rewards. Our two algorithms, SITH-BSP and LAZY-SITH-BSP, can be utilized on top of any method that constructs a belief tree externally. The third algorithm, SITH-PFT, is an anytime MCTS method that permits to plug-in any exploration technique. All our methods are guaranteed to return exactly the same optimal action as their unsimplified equivalents. We replace the costly computation of information-theoretic rewards with novel adaptive upper and lower bounds which we derive in this paper, and are of independent interest. We show that they are easy to calculate and can be tightened by the demand of our algorithms. Our approach is general; namely, any bounds that monotonically converge to the reward can be utilized to achieve a significant speedup without any loss in performance. Our theory and algorithms support the challenging setting of continuous states, actions, and observations. The beliefs can be parametric or general and represented by weighted particles. We demonstrate in simulation a significant speedup in planning compared to baseline approaches with guaranteed identical performance.},

Utilizing the MobileNetV2 architecture, this research leverages its efficiency and lightweight nature, making it suitable for mobile and embedded applications. Key techniques such as depthwise separable convolutions, linear bottlenecks, and inverted residuals help reduce the number of parameters and computational load while maintaining high performance in feature extraction. Additionally, the study employs comprehensive data augmentation methods, including horizontal and vertical flips, grayscale transformations, hue adjustments, brightness adjustments, and noise addition to enhance the model&#39;s robustness and generalization capabilities. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.53%∼100% with nearly perfect precision, recall of 95.7%, and F1-score of 94.6% for both “orange_good” and “orange_bad” classes, significantly outperforming previous models which typically achieved accuracies between 70% and 90%. While the classification performance was near-perfect in some aspects, there were minor errors in specific detection tasks. The confusion matrix shows that the model has high sensitivity and specificity, with very few misclassifications. Finally, this study highlights the practical applicability of the proposed model, particularly its easy deployment on resource-constrained devices and its effectiveness in agricultural product quality control processes. These findings affirm the model in this research as a reliable and highly efficient tool for agricultural product classification, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models in this field.},

However, the lack of a closed-form expression for this function has led to considerable research efforts to achieve more accurate approximations. This study introduces a new approximate method that provides high accuracy for the boundaries of the GQF. The proposed approach utilizes parametric functions for both the lower and upper bounds of the GQF. The parameters of these functions are estimated using the Wild Horse Optimization (WHO), a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, with the aim of minimizing the distance between the proposed functions and the actual GQF. The optimization process targets the minimization of the maximum absolute error and the mean absolute error, ensuring that the proposed bounds provide a tight and accurate approximation of the GQF. Numerical experiments and comparisons with existing bounds demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method. The new lower and upper bounds achieve significantly lower maximum absolute error and mean absolute error values compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in estimating the symbol error probability (SEP) for various digital modulation schemes, showing that the new bounds provide more accurate estimates of the SEP compared to the existing bounds.

  abstract     = {For patients diagnosed with a chronic condition, appropriately timing treatment is critically important. Many conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), have a maximum safe treatment interval (MSTI) in which treatment is required to prevent disease progression. We introduce a Markov decision process (MDP) with an ordinal action space as a way to quickly and safely identify the MSTI for an individual patient. The MDP’s ordinal action space allows users to update the expected outcomes of multiple actions with only a single decision. We solve the MDP and show how the expected outcomes of each action can be presented to clinicians as a menu of treatment options. We describe conditions under which the MDP is guaranteed to find the MSTI under uncertainty. We illustrate the model’s effectiveness through an application to AMD, and show that following the MDP can reduce patient exposure to symptoms by 38% and find the optimal interval 7% faster when compared to current clinical protocols.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the interaction between cheap-talk advertising and credible third-party product reviews to inform customers about product quality. We find that cheap-talk advertising can be informative when the firm’s private information helps predict a credible product review. A more informative credible product review has two effects on cheap-talk advertising. First, a credible product review plays a disciplinary role that enables the firm to provide informative advertising. Second, it reduces the incremental value of cheap-talk advertising. We find that, in equilibrium, whether or not the advertising is consistent with a credible product review is informative about product quality. The results also imply that an overly informative product review can reduce the total information available to customers by deterring the firm from providing informative advertising.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study a shelf-stock allocation problem in a data-driven setting where the demand distribution is unknown. The retailer needs to decide which commodities to place on each level of the shelf (location decision), and determine the stock level for each selected commodity at the shelf (stock decision) that can be adjusted based on updated demand prediction, under constraints on allocation and capacity, so as to maximize total expected profit. Key issues of the problem include demand endogeneity on vertical-location effect and the demand ambiguity that may arise from the ever shorter life cycles of commodities and other complicated determinants. We address the problem in a rolling-horizon fashion and develop a two-phase data-driven robust optimization model leveraging a decision-dependent Wasserstein metric that incorporates time-series demand forecasts and captures vertical-location effect under demand ambiguity. We derive tractable solution schemes for the model, in which the phase-I model determines the optimal location decision by solving one instance of mixed-integer linear program, while the phase-II model admits an analytical solution for updating the optimal stock. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity implications on how the ambiguity aversion impacts the optimal stock, and prove the consistency of the model solution under regularity condition on the underlying demand process that well justifies the asymptotic performance of the proposed data-driven approach. Finally, we extend our model to incorporate substitution effect, and conduct sufficient numerical experiments with real-life data that demonstrate the performance of our model.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores how a strategic B&amp;M retailer monetizes its showrooming service and how this affects a brand&#39;s incentive to use the service, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We build a stylized model in which the retailer decides the showrooming fee, and the brand decides whether to pay the fee to showcase its product in the retailer&#39;s offline channel in addition to its own online channel and separately sets the optimal prices for both channels. Consumers who face the uncertainty of the product value are assumed to have different levels of hassle costs of buying from the online channel and choosing which channel to visit. Our equilibrium analyses show that the brand has an incentive to use the retailer&#39;s offline channel to achieve an intended market segmentation based on hassle cost levels. Interestingly, the retailer&#39;s optimal profit and the brand&#39;s optimal prices both increase in search cost. Showrooming decreases consumer surplus when the value of a good match is relatively low or high, and a “Win–Win–Win–Win” situation in which all stakeholders (the retailer, the brand, consumers, and the social planner) benefit from monetizing the showrooming service may exist. Our paper also explores the role of a price-matching policy and service costs incurred by the retailer. Relevant managerial implications are discussed.},

  abstract     = {We examine a scenario in which a service provider updates its queue length information to customers at a specific frequency. Customers decide whether to join the queue based on the most recent update. Our objective is to determine the optimal updating frequency that benefits both the service provider and customers. Using a two-dimensional continuous-time Markov process, we model the actual and announced queue length processes. By proving the identical distributions of these two processes under a Poisson updating scheme, we derive closed-form solutions for customers’ utility functions. Our findings demonstrate that customers adopt a generalized mixed-threshold strategy at equilibrium, and their certainty about whether to join the queue or balk does not always increase with fresher information. Furthermore, we reveal that due to customers’ different sensitivities to information freshness, system performance metrics such as throughput and total customer utility exhibit non-monotonic behavior in response to the updating frequency. Consequently, providing fresher information does not necessarily lead to improved system performance. To address this, we propose algorithms to determine the optimal updating frequency for each system performance metric and identify the conditions under which different updating frequencies are optimal. We demonstrate that any positive updating frequency can achieve customer utility no worse than the no-information system. Additionally, in systems with high customer arrival rates, updating with a positive updating frequency can improve throughput. Furthermore, we prove conditions under which a positive and finite updating frequency can yield higher throughput and total customer utility compared to real-time information systems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we incorporate the effects of multi-unit purchases into consumer choice models and investigate the associated joint assortment and price optimization problems. Under the proposed two-stage choice framework, consumers first form a consideration set, and then select a product with the optimal quantity from the consideration set to maximize their utility. For the joint assortment and pricing problem with homogeneous consumers, we find that a multi-purchase-willingness-ordered assortment is optimal under certain technical conditions, and propose a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal assortment and prices for general cases. We further show that the optimal prices and assortment size are not monotone in multi-purchase preference and multi-purchase resistance. For the joint assortment and pricing problem with heterogeneous consumers, we first prove that this problem is NP-hard. We then consider a scenario with discrete prices and develop a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme by considering a finite number of consumer segments and nested consideration sets. We conduct an empirical study on the JD.com dataset and show that the new choice framework can improve model fitting and prediction accuracy compared with existing choice models with multiple purchases. We reveal that our model is especially suitable for datasets exhibiting a strong diminishing marginal effect for product variety. We further extend our analysis to price competition and establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium. For the joint optimization with fixed costs, we develop an algorithm that can find a solution guaranteeing at least half the optimal expected profit.},

  abstract     = {Supplier selection is critical in the sourcing process: retailers evaluate candidate suppliers across multiple attributes, including price, quality, speed, and service, to locate an ideal supply chain partner. While related theoretical research requires prior knowledge of retailers’ preferences across attributes, little empirical evidence about the criteria has been drawn from actual sourcing decisions. Capitalizing on an innovative online marketplace where manufacturers sell production capacity, our research reveals the relative importance assigned by retailers to over twenty supplier attributes including price, product quality, speed in multiple phases from ordering to delivery, and various ancillary services. Our research enables a direct connection between theoretical models and business practices and solidifies existing survey studies by removing reporting bias and increasing representative samples. Using various machine learning approaches, we discover that speed and price attributes are considered the most important, followed by quality, and finally, service offerings. We further investigate how supplier selection criteria are adjusted based on order sizes and product features. We reveal that, as the order size increases, price and quality attributes become more important while speed and service attributes plummet in importance. Furthermore, we find that retailers attach a higher value to speed and service attributes with trendy innovative products, but care more about the price dimension with long-life-cycle functional products. Based on these findings regarding supplier selection criteria, we provide investment guidelines for suppliers by quantifying the economic value associated with each non-price attribute. Also, to enable more efficient information disclosure, we recommend that online platforms consolidate their service menus by removing services with low enrollment rates and low impact on deal formation.},

  abstract     = {We study the ability to renegotiate in a supply chain setting with the possibility of supply disruption. Disruptions are a real threat to supply chains, especially as the supply chains become longer and more complex. When buyers and sellers write a purchase contract, specifying every possible contingency related to disruptions may not be realistic. However, the ability to renegotiate once a disruption occurs can help buyers and suppliers find efficient solutions. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment consisting of three studies, each exploring different conditions regarding relationship length, bargaining power, and communication. Our findings indicate that the ability to renegotiate increases buyer profit and decreases disruption inefficiency in short-term relationships but not in long-term ones. In free bargaining, where bargaining power is equal, the impact of renegotiation is greater than in ultimatum bargaining, where bargaining power is unequal. Additionally, when communication is not allowed in ultimatum bargaining, renegotiation significantly enhances buyer profit and reduces disruption inefficiency. These insights can assist managers in designing and negotiating incomplete contracts in environments prone to supply disruptions. The findings can aid managers in designing and negotiating incomplete contracts in environments with supply disruptions.},
