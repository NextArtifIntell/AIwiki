  abstract     = {For patients diagnosed with a chronic condition, appropriately timing treatment is critically important. Many conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), have a maximum safe treatment interval (MSTI) in which treatment is required to prevent disease progression. We introduce a Markov decision process (MDP) with an ordinal action space as a way to quickly and safely identify the MSTI for an individual patient. The MDP’s ordinal action space allows users to update the expected outcomes of multiple actions with only a single decision. We solve the MDP and show how the expected outcomes of each action can be presented to clinicians as a menu of treatment options. We describe conditions under which the MDP is guaranteed to find the MSTI under uncertainty. We illustrate the model’s effectiveness through an application to AMD, and show that following the MDP can reduce patient exposure to symptoms by 38% and find the optimal interval 7% faster when compared to current clinical protocols.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the interaction between cheap-talk advertising and credible third-party product reviews to inform customers about product quality. We find that cheap-talk advertising can be informative when the firm’s private information helps predict a credible product review. A more informative credible product review has two effects on cheap-talk advertising. First, a credible product review plays a disciplinary role that enables the firm to provide informative advertising. Second, it reduces the incremental value of cheap-talk advertising. We find that, in equilibrium, whether or not the advertising is consistent with a credible product review is informative about product quality. The results also imply that an overly informative product review can reduce the total information available to customers by deterring the firm from providing informative advertising.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study a shelf-stock allocation problem in a data-driven setting where the demand distribution is unknown. The retailer needs to decide which commodities to place on each level of the shelf (location decision), and determine the stock level for each selected commodity at the shelf (stock decision) that can be adjusted based on updated demand prediction, under constraints on allocation and capacity, so as to maximize total expected profit. Key issues of the problem include demand endogeneity on vertical-location effect and the demand ambiguity that may arise from the ever shorter life cycles of commodities and other complicated determinants. We address the problem in a rolling-horizon fashion and develop a two-phase data-driven robust optimization model leveraging a decision-dependent Wasserstein metric that incorporates time-series demand forecasts and captures vertical-location effect under demand ambiguity. We derive tractable solution schemes for the model, in which the phase-I model determines the optimal location decision by solving one instance of mixed-integer linear program, while the phase-II model admits an analytical solution for updating the optimal stock. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity implications on how the ambiguity aversion impacts the optimal stock, and prove the consistency of the model solution under regularity condition on the underlying demand process that well justifies the asymptotic performance of the proposed data-driven approach. Finally, we extend our model to incorporate substitution effect, and conduct sufficient numerical experiments with real-life data that demonstrate the performance of our model.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores how a strategic B&amp;M retailer monetizes its showrooming service and how this affects a brand&#39;s incentive to use the service, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We build a stylized model in which the retailer decides the showrooming fee, and the brand decides whether to pay the fee to showcase its product in the retailer&#39;s offline channel in addition to its own online channel and separately sets the optimal prices for both channels. Consumers who face the uncertainty of the product value are assumed to have different levels of hassle costs of buying from the online channel and choosing which channel to visit. Our equilibrium analyses show that the brand has an incentive to use the retailer&#39;s offline channel to achieve an intended market segmentation based on hassle cost levels. Interestingly, the retailer&#39;s optimal profit and the brand&#39;s optimal prices both increase in search cost. Showrooming decreases consumer surplus when the value of a good match is relatively low or high, and a “Win–Win–Win–Win” situation in which all stakeholders (the retailer, the brand, consumers, and the social planner) benefit from monetizing the showrooming service may exist. Our paper also explores the role of a price-matching policy and service costs incurred by the retailer. Relevant managerial implications are discussed.},

  abstract     = {We examine a scenario in which a service provider updates its queue length information to customers at a specific frequency. Customers decide whether to join the queue based on the most recent update. Our objective is to determine the optimal updating frequency that benefits both the service provider and customers. Using a two-dimensional continuous-time Markov process, we model the actual and announced queue length processes. By proving the identical distributions of these two processes under a Poisson updating scheme, we derive closed-form solutions for customers’ utility functions. Our findings demonstrate that customers adopt a generalized mixed-threshold strategy at equilibrium, and their certainty about whether to join the queue or balk does not always increase with fresher information. Furthermore, we reveal that due to customers’ different sensitivities to information freshness, system performance metrics such as throughput and total customer utility exhibit non-monotonic behavior in response to the updating frequency. Consequently, providing fresher information does not necessarily lead to improved system performance. To address this, we propose algorithms to determine the optimal updating frequency for each system performance metric and identify the conditions under which different updating frequencies are optimal. We demonstrate that any positive updating frequency can achieve customer utility no worse than the no-information system. Additionally, in systems with high customer arrival rates, updating with a positive updating frequency can improve throughput. Furthermore, we prove conditions under which a positive and finite updating frequency can yield higher throughput and total customer utility compared to real-time information systems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we incorporate the effects of multi-unit purchases into consumer choice models and investigate the associated joint assortment and price optimization problems. Under the proposed two-stage choice framework, consumers first form a consideration set, and then select a product with the optimal quantity from the consideration set to maximize their utility. For the joint assortment and pricing problem with homogeneous consumers, we find that a multi-purchase-willingness-ordered assortment is optimal under certain technical conditions, and propose a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal assortment and prices for general cases. We further show that the optimal prices and assortment size are not monotone in multi-purchase preference and multi-purchase resistance. For the joint assortment and pricing problem with heterogeneous consumers, we first prove that this problem is NP-hard. We then consider a scenario with discrete prices and develop a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme by considering a finite number of consumer segments and nested consideration sets. We conduct an empirical study on the JD.com dataset and show that the new choice framework can improve model fitting and prediction accuracy compared with existing choice models with multiple purchases. We reveal that our model is especially suitable for datasets exhibiting a strong diminishing marginal effect for product variety. We further extend our analysis to price competition and establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium. For the joint optimization with fixed costs, we develop an algorithm that can find a solution guaranteeing at least half the optimal expected profit.},

  abstract     = {Supplier selection is critical in the sourcing process: retailers evaluate candidate suppliers across multiple attributes, including price, quality, speed, and service, to locate an ideal supply chain partner. While related theoretical research requires prior knowledge of retailers’ preferences across attributes, little empirical evidence about the criteria has been drawn from actual sourcing decisions. Capitalizing on an innovative online marketplace where manufacturers sell production capacity, our research reveals the relative importance assigned by retailers to over twenty supplier attributes including price, product quality, speed in multiple phases from ordering to delivery, and various ancillary services. Our research enables a direct connection between theoretical models and business practices and solidifies existing survey studies by removing reporting bias and increasing representative samples. Using various machine learning approaches, we discover that speed and price attributes are considered the most important, followed by quality, and finally, service offerings. We further investigate how supplier selection criteria are adjusted based on order sizes and product features. We reveal that, as the order size increases, price and quality attributes become more important while speed and service attributes plummet in importance. Furthermore, we find that retailers attach a higher value to speed and service attributes with trendy innovative products, but care more about the price dimension with long-life-cycle functional products. Based on these findings regarding supplier selection criteria, we provide investment guidelines for suppliers by quantifying the economic value associated with each non-price attribute. Also, to enable more efficient information disclosure, we recommend that online platforms consolidate their service menus by removing services with low enrollment rates and low impact on deal formation.},

  abstract     = {We study the ability to renegotiate in a supply chain setting with the possibility of supply disruption. Disruptions are a real threat to supply chains, especially as the supply chains become longer and more complex. When buyers and sellers write a purchase contract, specifying every possible contingency related to disruptions may not be realistic. However, the ability to renegotiate once a disruption occurs can help buyers and suppliers find efficient solutions. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment consisting of three studies, each exploring different conditions regarding relationship length, bargaining power, and communication. Our findings indicate that the ability to renegotiate increases buyer profit and decreases disruption inefficiency in short-term relationships but not in long-term ones. In free bargaining, where bargaining power is equal, the impact of renegotiation is greater than in ultimatum bargaining, where bargaining power is unequal. Additionally, when communication is not allowed in ultimatum bargaining, renegotiation significantly enhances buyer profit and reduces disruption inefficiency. These insights can assist managers in designing and negotiating incomplete contracts in environments prone to supply disruptions. The findings can aid managers in designing and negotiating incomplete contracts in environments with supply disruptions.},
