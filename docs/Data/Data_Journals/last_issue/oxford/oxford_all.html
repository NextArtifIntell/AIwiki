  abstract     = {Two-sample hypothesis testing is a fundamental statistical problem for inference about two populations. In this paper, we construct a novel test statistic to detect high-dimensional distributional differences based on the max-sliced Wasserstein distance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. By exploiting an intriguing link between the distance and suprema of empirical processes, we develop an effective bootstrapping procedure to approximate the null distribution of the test statistic. One distinctive feature of the proposed test is the ability to construct simultaneous confidence intervals for the max-sliced Wasserstein distances of projected distributions of interest. This enables, not only the detection of global distributional differences, but also the identification of significantly different marginal distributions between two populations, without the need for additional tests. We establish the convergence of Gaussian and bootstrap approximations of the proposed test, based on which we show that the test is asymptotically valid and powerful as long as the considered max-sliced Wasserstein distance is adequately large. The merits of our approach are illustrated via simulated and real data examples.},

However, existing approaches to estimate and compare these effects largely overlook causality. In this paper, we study the effect smoking may have on having colorectal cancer subtypes defined by a trait known as microsatellite instability (MSI). We use principal stratification to propose an alternative causal estimand, the Subtype-Free Average Causal Effect (SF-ACE). The SF-ACE is the causal effect of the exposure among those who would be free from other disease subtypes under any exposure level. We study non-parametric identification of the SF-ACE and discuss different monotonicity assumptions, which are more nuanced than in the standard setting. As is often the case with principal stratum effects, the assumptions underlying the identification of the SF-ACE from the data are untestable and can be too strong. Therefore, we also develop sensitivity analysis methods that relax these assumptions. We present 3 different estimators, including a doubly robust estimator, for the SF-ACE. We implement our methodology for data from 2 large cohorts to study the heterogeneity in the causal effect of smoking on colorectal cancer with respect to MSI subtypes.},

While methods exist for estimating effects in the context of binary interventions, policies often result in varied exposures across regions implementing the policy. Yet, existing approaches for incorporating continuous exposures face substantial limitations in addressing confounding variables associated with intervention status, exposure levels, and outcome trends. These limitations significantly constrain policymakers’ ability to fully comprehend policy impacts and design future interventions. In this work, we propose new estimators for causal effect curves within the DiD framework, accounting for multiple sources of confounding. Our approach accommodates misspecification of a subset of intervention, exposure, and outcome models while avoiding any parametric assumptions on the effect curve.

  abstract     = {Dose-finding trials are a key component of the drug development process and rely on a statistical design to help inform dosing decisions. Triallists wishing to choose a design require knowledge of operating characteristics of competing methods. This is often assessed using a large-scale simulation study with multiple designs and configurations investigated, which can be time-consuming and therefore limits the scope of the simulation. We introduce a new approach to the design of simulation studies of dose-finding trials. The approach simulates all potential outcomes that individuals could experience at each dose level in the trial. Datasets are simulated in advance and then applied to each of the competing methods to enable a more efficient head-to-head comparison. Furthermore, individual trial datasets can be interrogated to understand when designs deviate in their decision making. In three case-studies, we show sizeable reductions in Monte Carlo error for comparing a performance metric between two competing designs. Efficiency gains depend on the similarity of the designs. Comparing two Phase I/II design variants, with high correlation of recommending the same optimal biologic dose, we show that the new approach requires a simulation study that is approximately 48 times smaller than the conventional approach. Furthermore, advance-simulated trial datasets can be reused to assess the performance of designs across multiple configurations. We recommend researchers consider this more efficient simulation approach in their dose-finding studies and we have updated the R package escalation to help facilitate implementation.},

The statistical problem in large-scale mediation analysis concerns testing composite null hypotheses in the context of large-scale multiple testing. The classical Sobel’s and joint significance tests are overly conservative and therefore are underpowered in practice. In this work, we propose a testing method for large-scale composite null hypothesis testing to properly control the type I error and hence improve the testing power. Our method is simple and essentially only requires counting the number of observed test statistics in a certain region. Non-asymptotic theories are established under weak assumptions and indicate that the proposed method controls the type I error well and is powerful. Extensive simulation studies confirm our non-asymptotic theories and show that the proposed method controls the type I error in all settings and has strong power. A data analysis on DNA methylation is also presented to illustrate our method.},

Although some methods have been developed for the problem, they are not applicable to situations where there exist both interval censoring and competing risks. We fill in this critical gap under a class of transformation models for cumulative incidence functions by developing an instrumented variable (IV) estimation approach. The IV is a valuable tool commonly used to mitigate the impact of endogenous treatment selection and to determine causal treatment effects in an unbiased manner. The proposed method is flexible as the model includes many commonly used models such as the sub-distributional proportional odds and hazards models (ie, the Fine–Gray model) as special cases. The resulting estimator for the regression parameter is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate finite sample performance of the proposed approach and suggests that it works well in practice. It is applied to a breast cancer screening study.},

We consider the patterns of recruits (new trees) and dead trees between rain forest censuses. For a current census, we specify regression models for the conditional intensity of recruits and the conditional probabilities of death given the current trees and spatial covariates. We estimate regression parameters using conditional composite likelihood functions that only involve the conditional first order properties of the data. When constructing assumption lean estimators of covariance matrices of parameter estimates, we only need mild assumptions of decaying conditional correlations in space, while assumptions regarding correlations over time are avoided by exploiting conditional centering of composite likelihood score functions. Time series of point patterns from rain forest censuses are quite short, while each point pattern covers a fairly big spatial region. To obtain asymptotic results, we therefore use a central limit theorem for the fixed timespan—increasing spatial domain asymptotic setting. This also allows us to handle the challenge of using stochastic covariates constructed from past point patterns. Conveniently, it suffices to impose weak dependence assumptions on the innovations of the space-time process. We investigate the proposed methodology by simulation studies and an application to rain forest data.},

Given these complementary features, we propose a power likelihood approach to augmenting randomized controlled trials with observational data to improve the efficiency of treatment effect estimation. We provide a data-adaptive procedure for maximizing the expected log predictive density (ELPD) to select the learning rate that best regulates the information from the observational data. We validate our method through a simulation study that shows increased power while maintaining an approximate nominal coverage rate. Finally, we apply our method in a real-world data fusion study augmenting the PIONEER 6 clinical trial with a US health claims dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method and providing detailed guidance on how to address practical considerations in its application.},

For example, in our Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging study, we need to select the relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms out of 582 591 candidates for the distribution of voxel-level intensities in each of 42 brain regions. To this end, we propose a new sure independence screening (SIS) procedure for general metric space-valued responses based on global Fréchet regression, termed as Fréchet-SIS. The marginal general residual sum of squares is utilized to serve as a marginal utility for evaluating the importance of predictors, where only a distance between data objects is needed. We theoretically show that the proposed Fréchet-SIS procedure enjoys the sure screening property under mild regularity conditions. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to demonstrate its excellent finite-sample performance. In Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging study, we identify important genes that correlate with brain activity across different stages of the disease and brain regions.

In this work, we propose to generalize the pseudo-observations approach to situations where a bivariate failure-time variable is observed, subject to right censoring. The idea is to first estimate the joint survival function of both failure times and then use it to define the relevant pseudo-observations. Once the pseudo-observations are calculated, they are used as the response in a generalized linear model. We consider 2 common nonparametric estimators of the joint survival function: the estimator of Lin and Ying (1993) and the Dabrowska estimator (Dabrowska, 1988). For both estimators, we show that our bivariate pseudo-observations approach produces regression estimates that are consistent and asymptotically normal. Our proposed method enables estimation of covariate effects on quantities such as the joint survival probability at a fixed bivariate time point or simultaneously at several time points and, consequentially, can estimate covariate-adjusted conditional survival probabilities. We demonstrate the method using simulations and an analysis of 2 real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {There is still more to learn about the pathobiology of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) despite 4 years of the pandemic. A multiomics approach offers a comprehensive view of the disease and has the potential to yield deeper insight into the pathogenesis of the disease. Previous multiomics integrative analysis and prediction studies for COVID-19 severity and status have assumed simple relationships (ie linear relationships) between omics data and between omics and COVID-19 outcomes. However, these linear methods do not account for the inherent underlying nonlinear structure associated with these different types of data. The motivation behind this work is to model nonlinear relationships in multiomics and COVID-19 outcomes, and to determine key multidimensional molecules associated with the disease. Toward this goal, we develop scalable randomized kernel methods for jointly associating data from multiple sources or views and simultaneously predicting an outcome or classifying a unit into one of 2 or more classes. We also determine variables or groups of variables that best contribute to the relationships among the views. We use the idea that random Fourier bases can approximate shift-invariant kernel functions to construct nonlinear mappings of each view and we use these mappings and the outcome variable to learn view-independent low-dimensional representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through extensive simulations. When the proposed methods were applied to gene expression, metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics data pertaining to COVID-19, we identified several molecular signatures for COVID-19 status and severity. Our results agree with previous findings and suggest potential avenues for future research.

However, a notable limitation of TSI models is their primary reliance on incidence data. Even when hospitalization data are available, existing TSI models have not been crafted to improve the estimation of disease transmission or to estimate hospitalization-related parameters—metrics crucial for understanding a pandemic and planning hospital resources. Moreover, their dependence on reported infection data makes them vulnerable to variations in data quality. In this study, we advance TSI models by integrating hospitalization data, marking a significant step forward in modeling with TSI models. We introduce hospitalization propensity parameters to jointly model incidence and hospitalization data. We use a composite likelihood function to accommodate complex data structure and a Monte Carlo expectation–maximization algorithm to estimate model parameters. We analyze COVID-19 data to estimate disease transmission, assess risk factor impacts, and calculate hospitalization propensity. Our model improves the accuracy of estimating the instantaneous reproduction number in TSI models, particularly when hospitalization data is of higher quality than incidence data. It enables the estimation of key infectious disease parameters without relying on contact tracing data and provides a foundation for integrating TSI models with other infectious disease models.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth in the speed and convenience of information dissemination has made copyright infringement increasingly common. Blockchain technology solves pain points such as difficulties in traditional copyright registration, easy infringement, and difficulties in confirming and safeguarding rights. It also realises the decentralised management of copyright, network-wide tracking and monitoring, trusted certificate deposits, among others. However, the efficient original authentication of works and the function of blockchain to create copyright trading channels in the field of copyright are often ignored. This paper designed a self-adaptive learning similarity detection fusion strategy to protect the copyright of original digital works, namely SAAChain, and built a platform for releasing and storing original works based on non-fungible tokens. SAAChain first measures the similarity of a work based on adaptive learning to realise the originality authentication of works. Secondly, the works are stored on the InterPlanetary File System as NFTs, along with copyright information. Finally, a smart contract based on Ethereum and ERC-721 is designed to realise the free circulation of digital rights while simultaneously constructing an efficient and convenient digital rights protection system. Experiments show that the accuracy of the fusion strategy for adaptive work similarity detection can reach above 97%, which meets the requirements of work originality verification. Because of the storage mode of the platform, the system has good performance in terms of response speed and storage efficiency. The entire process provides a full-process and transparent transaction platform for all parties and guarantees the copyright ownership of works as well as the non-tampering and traceability of copyright information.},

  abstract     = {Shared developmental, physiological, and molecular mechanisms can generate strong genetic covariances across suites of traits, constraining genetic variability, and evolvability to certain axes in multivariate trait space (“variational modules” or “syndromes”). Such trait suites will not only respond jointly to selection; they will also covary across populations that diverged from one another by genetic drift. We report evidence for such a genetically correlated trait suite that links traits related to energy metabolism along a “power-endurance” axis in Drosophila melanogaster. The “power” pole of the axis is characterized by high potential for energy generation and expenditure—high expression of glycolysis and TCA cycle genes, high abundance of mitochondria, and high spontaneous locomotor activity. The opposite “endurance” pole is characterized by high triglyceride (fat) reserves, locomotor endurance, and starvation resistance (and low values of traits associated with the “power” pole). This trait suite also aligns with the first principal component of metabolome; the “power” direction is characterized by low levels of trehalose (blood sugar) and high levels of some amino acids and their derivatives, including creatine, a compound known to facilitate energy production in muscles. Our evidence comes from six replicate “Selected” populations adapted to a nutrient-poor larval diet regime during 250 generations of experimental evolution and six “Control” populations evolved in parallel on a standard diet regime. We found that, within each of these experimental evolutionary regimes, the above traits strongly covaried along this “power-endurance” axis across replicate populations which diversified by drift, indicating a shared genetic architecture. The two evolutionary regimes also drove divergence along this axis, with Selected populations on average displaced towards the “power” direction compared to Controls. Aspects of this “power-endurance” axis resemble the “pace of life” syndrome and the “thrifty phenotype”; it may have evolved as part of a coordinated organismal response to nutritional conditions. While evolution is often looked at one trait at a time, there is increasing awareness that developmental, physiological, and cellular regulatory mechanisms integrate multiple traits in correlated traits suites or “syndromes,” constraining their ability to vary independently of one another. We report such a trait syndrome linking traits involved in energy generation, energy expenditure, and energy storage in fruit flies. We found that, among a set of genetically differentiated laboratory fly populations, those that show a high cellular potential for energy generation (based on gene expression and mitochondria abundance) are also characterized by a high rate of locomotor activity, but low endurance, low-fat reserves, and low resistance to starvation—and vice versa. This is accompanied by differences in metabolome profile consistent with a known physiological role of some compounds, such as trehalose (blood sugar in insects) and creatine. This concerted evolution of these diverse traits suggests that they share genetic architecture, likely reflecting regulatory mechanisms that evolved to ensure coordinated responses to varying nutritional conditions, and which now constrain traits from evolving independently. This implies that physiological mechanisms evolved in the past may canalize future evolution.},

(2024). Does metabolic rate influence genome-wide amino acid

  abstract     = {Natural selection is believed to shape amino acid usage of the proteome by minimizing the energy cost of protein biosynthesis. Although this hypothesis explains well the amino acid frequency (AA frequency ) difference among the 20 common amino acids within a given genome (species), whether it is applicable to cross-species difference remains to be inspected. Here, we proposed and tested a “metabolic rate hypothesis,” which suggests that metabolic rate impacts genome-wide AA frequency , considering that the energy allocated to protein biosynthesis is under selection pressure due to metabolic rate constraint. We performed integrated phylogenetic comparative analyses on proteomic sequence and metabolic rate data of 166 species covering 130 eumetazoan orders. We showed that resting metabolic rate (RMR) was significantly linked to AA frequency variation across animal lineages, with a contribution comparable to or greater than genomic traits such as GC content and codon usage bias. Consistent with the metabolic rate hypothesis, low-energy-cost amino acids are observed to be more likely at higher frequency in animal species with high (residual) metabolic rate. Correlated evolution of RMR and AA frequency was further inferred being driven by adaptation. The relationship between RMR and AA frequency varied greatly among amino acids, most likely reflecting a trade-off among various interacting factors. Overall, there exists no “one-size-fits-all” predictor for AA frequency , and integrated investigation of multilevel traits is indispensable for a fuller understanding of AA frequency variation and evolution in animal. Natural selection has previously been proposed to underlie compositional differences of amino acids within a given animal species: to minimize the energy cost of protein biosynthesis, selection should result in an increased abundance of energy-cheap amino acids and a decreased abundance of energy-expensive ones in the proteome. However, amino acid composition varies greatly among species, yet the underlying evolutionary processes are largely unclear. Here, we propose that interspecific variations in metabolic rate exert an effect on amino acid composition due to natural selection, which is referred to as the “metabolic rate hypothesis.” The present study intended to test this hypothesis by examining the relationship between molecular-level amino acid frequency and organism-level metabolic rate (as a proxy for energy cost) in an evolutionary framework. Phylogeny-based analysis revealed significant connection of these two traits, indicating they have evolved most likely in concert, and metabolic rate is an important confining factor to the compositional variation of amino acid in animal. Consistent with the metabolic rate hypothesis, low-energy-cost amino acids are observed to be more likely at higher frequency in animal species with high residual metabolic rate.},

  abstract     = {Many testing problems are readily amenable to randomized tests, such as those employing data splitting. However, despite their usefulness in principle, randomized tests have obvious drawbacks. Firstly, two analyses of the same dataset may lead to different results. Secondly, the test typically loses power because it does not fully utilize the entire sample. As a remedy to these drawbacks, we study how to combine the test statistics or p -values resulting from multiple random realizations, such as through random data splits. We develop rank-transformed subsampling as a general method for delivering large-sample inference about the combined statistic or p -value under mild assumptions. We apply our methodology to a wide range of problems, including testing unimodality in high-dimensional data, testing goodness-of-fit of parametric quantile regression models, testing no direct effect in a sequentially randomized trial and calibrating cross-fit double machine learning confidence intervals. In contrast to existing p -value aggregation schemes that can be highly conservative, our method enjoys Type I error control that asymptotically approaches the nominal level. Moreover, compared to using the ordinary subsampling, we show that our rank transform can remove the first-order bias in approximating the null under alternatives and greatly improve power.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel framework called Mo de-wise P rincipal S u bspace P ursuit ( MOP-UP ) to extract hidden variations in both the row and column dimensions for matrix data. To enhance the understanding of the framework, we introduce a class of matrix-variate spiked covariance models that serve as inspiration for the development of the MOP-UP algorithm. The MOP-UP algorithm consists of two steps: Average Subspace Capture ( ASC ) and Alternating Projection. These steps are specifically designed to capture the row-wise and column-wise dimension-reduced subspaces which contain the most informative features of the data. ASC utilizes a novel average projection operator as initialization and achieves exact recovery in the noiseless setting. We analyse the convergence and non-asymptotic error bounds of MOP-UP , introducing a blockwise matrix eigenvalue perturbation bound that proves the desired bound, where classic perturbation bounds fail. The effectiveness and practical merits of the proposed framework are demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real datasets. Lastly, we discuss generalizations of our approach to higher-order data.},

We show that X can be viewed as a graphical model with an uncountably infinite graph, where each X u is a vertex. This graph is characterized by the reproducing property of X ’ s covariance kernel, without restricting U to be finite or countable, allowing the modelling of stochastic processes in continuous time/space. Unlike traditional methods, this characterization is not based on zero entries of an inverse covariance, posing challenges for structure estimation. We propose a plug-in methodology that targets graph recovery up to a finite resolution and shows consistency for graphs which are sufficiently regular and that can be applied to virtually any measurement regime. Furthermore, we derive convergence rates and finite-sample guarantees for the method, and demonstrate its performance through a simulation study and two data analyses.},

The networks of interest may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and may have distinct vertex sets of different sizes. Given two networks and a cost function relating their vertices, NetOTC finds a transition coupling of their associated random walks having minimum expected cost. The minimizing cost quantifies the difference between the networks, while the optimal transport plan itself provides alignments of both the vertices and the edges of the two networks. Coupling of the full random walks, rather than their marginal distributions, ensures that NetOTC captures local and global information about the networks and preserves edges. NetOTC has no free parameters and does not rely on randomization. We investigate a number of theoretical properties of NetOTC and present experiments establishing its empirical performance.},

However, their practical use is still hampered by a slow recovery process (generally &gt;30 min) during cooling, attributed to sluggish mass diffusion and delayed phase dissolution. Herein, we present a high-entropy phase separation design to significantly accelerate the recovery dynamics of these materials. We demonstrate this concept using a thermal-stiffening poly(calcium acrylate)-based copolymer hydrogel by incorporating hydrophilic units. Mechanistically, the hydrophilic units disrupt the dense packing of thermal-stiffening clusters, creating a high-entropy topological structure with a low energy barrier for rapid mass diffusion. This approach retains the impressive thermal-stiffening response with a 760-fold increase in storage modulus, while dramatically reducing the characteristic recovery time to merely 28 s. We anticipate this high-entropy strategy to be broadly applicable in designing modulus-adaptive materials with fast switching dynamics.},

  abstract     = {National greenhouse gas (GHG) budget, including CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O has increasingly become a topic of concern in international climate governance. China is paying increasing attention to reducing GHG emissions and increasing land sinks to effectively mitigate climate change. Accurate estimates of GHG fluxes are crucial for monitoring progress toward mitigating GHG emissions in China. This study used comprehensive methods, including emission factor methods, process-based models, atmospheric inversions, and data-driven models, to estimate the long-term trends of GHG sources and sinks from all anthropogenic and natural sectors in China&#39;s mainland during 2000–2023, and produced an up-to-date China GHG Budget dataset (CNGHG). The total gross emissions of the three GHGs show a 3-fold increase from 5.0 (95% CI: 4.9–5.1) Gt CO 2 -eq yr −1 (in 2000) to 14.3 (95% CI: 13.8–14.8) Gt CO 2 -eq yr −1 (in 2023). CO 2 emissions represented 81.8% of the GHG emissions in 2023, while 12.7% and 5.5% were for CH 4 and N 2 O, respectively. As the largest CO 2 source, the energy sector contributed 87.4% CO 2 emissions. In contrast, the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector was the largest sector of CH 4 and N 2 O, representing 50.1% and 66.3% emissions, respectively. Moreover, China&#39;s terrestrial ecosystems serve as a net CO 2 sink (1.0 Gt CO 2 yr −1 , 95% CI: 0.2–1.9 Gt CO 2 yr −1 ) during 2012 to 2021, equivalent to an average of 14.3% of fossil CO 2 emissions. Our GHG emission estimates showed a general consistency with national GHG inventories, with gridded and sector-specific estimates of GHG fluxes over China, providing the basis for curtailing GHG emissions for each region and sector.},

Here, we develop a vdW confined space assisted hydrogenation method to produce AH-Gr. The confined space between graphene and the substrate aggregates hydrogen radicals, making the bottom-side of graphene more prone to hydrogenation. The dense and homogeneous confined spaces between adjacent vdW crystals promote rapid and uniform distribution of carbon-hydrogen (C−H) bonds. The hydrogen-to-carbon atomic (H/C) ratios can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting the permeated proton dose. All AH-Gr, regardless of H/C ratios, remain vacancy-free. The spatial distributions of C−H bonds significantly influence the electrical and magnetic properties of AH-Gr. Asymmetric hydrogenation transforms graphene from a semi-metal to a semiconductor, suppresses the quantum Hall effect, and reduces the phase coherence length. This study provides new insights into the preparation and characteristics of hydrogenated graphene, broadening the applications of vdW confined space.},

The weakly solvated electrolytes show weak ion–dipole interaction and promote rapid desolvation but are faced with sluggish ion-transport kinetics, thus inducing high overpotential and Li-dendrite formation. Herein, by applying methyl propionate as a weakly coordinated cosolvent, a loose solvation shell that is regulated by anion–solvent interaction enables weakened Li + –anion interaction while maintaining adequate anion participation, featuring a facilitated bulk ion-transport route via anion dissociation, originally achieving a high ionic conductivity of 17.74 mS cm −1 in weakly solvated electrolytes at 25°C. Consequently, this advanced electrolyte design markedly mitigates concentration polarization and regulates uniform Li deposition, and thus the hybrid anode achieves 99.8% average coulombic efficiency within 1500 cycles at 4C and improved cycling stability at a low N/P ratio of 0.5, making a breakthrough in alkali-metal-ion batteries.},

  abstract     = {The reciprocal mapping between the geometry and properties of a unit cell is crucial for the intelligent and inverse design of advanced materials and structural systems. Beyond classical homogenization-based numerical methods, this paper presents an efficient and accurate mapping between the geometry and properties of a class of unit cells described by moving morphable components, achieved via a graph convolutional neural network. This leads to a structural genome database (SGD) approach for the intelligent design of mechanical metamaterials. Using the SGD approach, metamaterials exhibiting the Hashin–Shtrikman upper bound of bulk modulus, auxetic behavior and the unimodal property have been created, with design efficiency improved by 3–4 orders of magnitude. Additionally, transfer learning and a small amount of training data allow the SGD to predict non-local behaviors beyond a unit cell, such as optimized unit cells with critical buckling strength enhanced by nearly 200% and a bandgap metamaterial with a relative bandgap width of 51%. Experimentally validated optimized metamaterials demonstrate auxetic behavior and superior buckling resistance. The proposed SGD approach holds promise for the advanced design of multi-scale and multi-physics systems.},

  abstract     = {Gallium-based liquid metals, when combined with magnetic agents, emerge as intelligent materials with potential applications in soft robotics within biomedical engineering. However, concerns have arisen from the residual presence of liquid metal, raising long-term biological risks. Herein, we propose a containment method that involves the rolling of magnetic liquid-metal droplets in lyophilized powders, resulting in the formation of intact hydrogel coatings upon hydration. These hydrogel coatings adhere to the liquid-metal surface, forming a cohesive network through hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid groups and siloxane linkages from silanol groups. This synergy of physical and chemical interactions enables hydrogel coatings with exceptional stretchability, fracture energy and interfacial bonding to liquid metals. Consequently, the hydrogel-coated containment capsule of magnetic liquid metal exhibits remarkable resilience to cyclic compression, enduring strains of ≤85%, while also withstanding impacts from heights of &gt;14 m. Moreover, the containment capsules demonstrate large deformation capabilities, dexterous locomotion and wireless heating under the control of static and alternating magnetic fields. They showcase the capability for remote thermal ablation operations on ex vivo porcine stomachs and in vivo rabbit models.},

  abstract     = {Agriculture emerges as a prominent contributor to CH 4 and N 2 O emissions in China. However, estimates of these two non-CO 2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) remain poorly constrained, hindering a precise understanding of their spatiotemporal dynamics and the development of effective mitigation strategies. Here, we established a consistent estimation framework that integrates emission-factor approach, data-driven models and process-based biogeochemical models, to identify the magnitudes, spatial variations, and long-term trends of agricultural non-CO 2 GHG emissions in China&#39;s mainland from 1980 to 2023. Over the study period, the average total agricultural non-CO 2 GHG emissions amounted to 722.5 ± 102.3 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 , with livestock CH 4 , cropland CH 4 , cropland N 2 O and livestock N 2 O contributing 41% (297.4 ± 64.3 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ), 31% (225.0 ± 69.6 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ), 18% (130.6 ± 9.4 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ) and 10% (69.4 ± 20.2 Tg CO 2 -eq yr −1 ), respectively. Approximately 70% of these emissions were concentrated in the eastern region beyond the Hu Line, with emission hotspots identified in South-central China, East China, and the Sichuan Basin. Our analysis revealed three distinct temporal stages of total emissions during the study period: rapid growth (1980–late 1990s), slow growth (late 1990s–middle 2010s), and a stabilization stage (since the middle 2010s). These stages reflect the evolving trajectory of agriculture in China, from the expansion of agricultural yields, to the transformation of agricultural practices, and ultimately the pursuit of sustainable development. However, the temporal trajectory of emissions varied significantly across different regions, highlighting divergent levels of agricultural development. This study presents a comprehensive, gridded, and consistent estimate of agricultural non-CO 2 GHG emissions in China, offering valuable insights for policymakers to develop tailored strategies that adapt to local conditions, enabling effective emission reduction measures.},
