  abstract     = {Many testing problems are readily amenable to randomized tests, such as those employing data splitting. However, despite their usefulness in principle, randomized tests have obvious drawbacks. Firstly, two analyses of the same dataset may lead to different results. Secondly, the test typically loses power because it does not fully utilize the entire sample. As a remedy to these drawbacks, we study how to combine the test statistics or p -values resulting from multiple random realizations, such as through random data splits. We develop rank-transformed subsampling as a general method for delivering large-sample inference about the combined statistic or p -value under mild assumptions. We apply our methodology to a wide range of problems, including testing unimodality in high-dimensional data, testing goodness-of-fit of parametric quantile regression models, testing no direct effect in a sequentially randomized trial and calibrating cross-fit double machine learning confidence intervals. In contrast to existing p -value aggregation schemes that can be highly conservative, our method enjoys Type I error control that asymptotically approaches the nominal level. Moreover, compared to using the ordinary subsampling, we show that our rank transform can remove the first-order bias in approximating the null under alternatives and greatly improve power.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel framework called Mo de-wise P rincipal S u bspace P ursuit ( MOP-UP ) to extract hidden variations in both the row and column dimensions for matrix data. To enhance the understanding of the framework, we introduce a class of matrix-variate spiked covariance models that serve as inspiration for the development of the MOP-UP algorithm. The MOP-UP algorithm consists of two steps: Average Subspace Capture ( ASC ) and Alternating Projection. These steps are specifically designed to capture the row-wise and column-wise dimension-reduced subspaces which contain the most informative features of the data. ASC utilizes a novel average projection operator as initialization and achieves exact recovery in the noiseless setting. We analyse the convergence and non-asymptotic error bounds of MOP-UP , introducing a blockwise matrix eigenvalue perturbation bound that proves the desired bound, where classic perturbation bounds fail. The effectiveness and practical merits of the proposed framework are demonstrated through experiments on both simulated and real datasets. Lastly, we discuss generalizations of our approach to higher-order data.},

  abstract     = {Let X = { X u } u ∈ U be a real-valued Gaussian process indexed by a set U ⁠ . We show that X can be viewed as a graphical model with an uncountably infinite graph, where each X u is a vertex. This graph is characterized by the reproducing property of X ’ s covariance kernel, without restricting U to be finite or countable, allowing the modelling of stochastic processes in continuous time/space. Unlike traditional methods, this characterization is not based on zero entries of an inverse covariance, posing challenges for structure estimation. We propose a plug-in methodology that targets graph recovery up to a finite resolution and shows consistency for graphs which are sufficiently regular and that can be applied to virtually any measurement regime. Furthermore, we derive convergence rates and finite-sample guarantees for the method, and demonstrate its performance through a simulation study and two data analyses.},

  abstract     = {We describe and study a transport-based procedure called network optimal transition coupling (NetOTC) for the comparison and alignment of two networks. The networks of interest may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and may have distinct vertex sets of different sizes. Given two networks and a cost function relating their vertices, NetOTC finds a transition coupling of their associated random walks having minimum expected cost. The minimizing cost quantifies the difference between the networks, while the optimal transport plan itself provides alignments of both the vertices and the edges of the two networks. Coupling of the full random walks, rather than their marginal distributions, ensures that NetOTC captures local and global information about the networks and preserves edges. NetOTC has no free parameters and does not rely on randomization. We investigate a number of theoretical properties of NetOTC and present experiments establishing its empirical performance.},
