  abstract     = {Shared developmental, physiological, and molecular mechanisms can generate strong genetic covariances across suites of traits, constraining genetic variability, and evolvability to certain axes in multivariate trait space (“variational modules” or “syndromes”). Such trait suites will not only respond jointly to selection; they will also covary across populations that diverged from one another by genetic drift. We report evidence for such a genetically correlated trait suite that links traits related to energy metabolism along a “power-endurance” axis in Drosophila melanogaster. The “power” pole of the axis is characterized by high potential for energy generation and expenditure—high expression of glycolysis and TCA cycle genes, high abundance of mitochondria, and high spontaneous locomotor activity. The opposite “endurance” pole is characterized by high triglyceride (fat) reserves, locomotor endurance, and starvation resistance (and low values of traits associated with the “power” pole). This trait suite also aligns with the first principal component of metabolome; the “power” direction is characterized by low levels of trehalose (blood sugar) and high levels of some amino acids and their derivatives, including creatine, a compound known to facilitate energy production in muscles. Our evidence comes from six replicate “Selected” populations adapted to a nutrient-poor larval diet regime during 250 generations of experimental evolution and six “Control” populations evolved in parallel on a standard diet regime. We found that, within each of these experimental evolutionary regimes, the above traits strongly covaried along this “power-endurance” axis across replicate populations which diversified by drift, indicating a shared genetic architecture. The two evolutionary regimes also drove divergence along this axis, with Selected populations on average displaced towards the “power” direction compared to Controls. Aspects of this “power-endurance” axis resemble the “pace of life” syndrome and the “thrifty phenotype”; it may have evolved as part of a coordinated organismal response to nutritional conditions. While evolution is often looked at one trait at a time, there is increasing awareness that developmental, physiological, and cellular regulatory mechanisms integrate multiple traits in correlated traits suites or “syndromes,” constraining their ability to vary independently of one another. We report such a trait syndrome linking traits involved in energy generation, energy expenditure, and energy storage in fruit flies. We found that, among a set of genetically differentiated laboratory fly populations, those that show a high cellular potential for energy generation (based on gene expression and mitochondria abundance) are also characterized by a high rate of locomotor activity, but low endurance, low-fat reserves, and low resistance to starvation—and vice versa. This is accompanied by differences in metabolome profile consistent with a known physiological role of some compounds, such as trehalose (blood sugar in insects) and creatine. This concerted evolution of these diverse traits suggests that they share genetic architecture, likely reflecting regulatory mechanisms that evolved to ensure coordinated responses to varying nutritional conditions, and which now constrain traits from evolving independently. This implies that physiological mechanisms evolved in the past may canalize future evolution.},

(2024). Does metabolic rate influence genome-wide amino acid

  abstract     = {Natural selection is believed to shape amino acid usage of the proteome by minimizing the energy cost of protein biosynthesis. Although this hypothesis explains well the amino acid frequency (AA frequency ) difference among the 20 common amino acids within a given genome (species), whether it is applicable to cross-species difference remains to be inspected. Here, we proposed and tested a “metabolic rate hypothesis,” which suggests that metabolic rate impacts genome-wide AA frequency , considering that the energy allocated to protein biosynthesis is under selection pressure due to metabolic rate constraint. We performed integrated phylogenetic comparative analyses on proteomic sequence and metabolic rate data of 166 species covering 130 eumetazoan orders. We showed that resting metabolic rate (RMR) was significantly linked to AA frequency variation across animal lineages, with a contribution comparable to or greater than genomic traits such as GC content and codon usage bias. Consistent with the metabolic rate hypothesis, low-energy-cost amino acids are observed to be more likely at higher frequency in animal species with high (residual) metabolic rate. Correlated evolution of RMR and AA frequency was further inferred being driven by adaptation. The relationship between RMR and AA frequency varied greatly among amino acids, most likely reflecting a trade-off among various interacting factors. Overall, there exists no “one-size-fits-all” predictor for AA frequency , and integrated investigation of multilevel traits is indispensable for a fuller understanding of AA frequency variation and evolution in animal. Natural selection has previously been proposed to underlie compositional differences of amino acids within a given animal species: to minimize the energy cost of protein biosynthesis, selection should result in an increased abundance of energy-cheap amino acids and a decreased abundance of energy-expensive ones in the proteome. However, amino acid composition varies greatly among species, yet the underlying evolutionary processes are largely unclear. Here, we propose that interspecific variations in metabolic rate exert an effect on amino acid composition due to natural selection, which is referred to as the “metabolic rate hypothesis.” The present study intended to test this hypothesis by examining the relationship between molecular-level amino acid frequency and organism-level metabolic rate (as a proxy for energy cost) in an evolutionary framework. Phylogeny-based analysis revealed significant connection of these two traits, indicating they have evolved most likely in concert, and metabolic rate is an important confining factor to the compositional variation of amino acid in animal. Consistent with the metabolic rate hypothesis, low-energy-cost amino acids are observed to be more likely at higher frequency in animal species with high residual metabolic rate.},
