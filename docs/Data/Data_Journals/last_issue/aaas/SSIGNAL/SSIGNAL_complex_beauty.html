  abstract     = {Because the STAT family of transcriptional regulators induces the expression of genes involved in antiviral signaling, they are often targeted by viruses to suppress immune responses. Activation of STATs by tyrosine phosphorylation induces their dimerization, and STAT dimers can assemble into tetramers with different transcriptional properties. Sugiyama et al . solved the cryo-EM structure of a tetrameric form of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 in complex with DNA, showing how interactions between N-terminal domains of the protein supported the dimerization of STAT1 dimers. Biochemical analyses and modeling further indicated how the rabies virus P-protein specifically targets STAT1 tetramers, suggesting a potential mechanism of immune evasion. —John F. Foley Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members mediate signaling in the Janus kinase (JAK)–STAT pathway and are activated by phosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine residue, resulting in dimerization through reciprocal interactions between the phosphotyrosine and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT (pY-STAT) then translocates to the nucleus to induce the expression of genes encoding antiviral proteins. Although the active and functional forms of STATs are conventionally considered to be dimers, STATs can undergo higher-order oligomerization, which is implicated in regulating transcriptional activity. We present the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the tetrameric form of intact pY-STAT1 in complex with DNA, which indicates that interactions between the amino-terminal domains (NTDs) of STAT1 induce oligomerization. The tetrameric structure revealed a compact conformation with a previously uncharacterized binding interface: Two DNA-bound dimers are twofold symmetrically aligned to transform into a tandem DNA-binding model without NTD dimer separation. Moreover, biochemical analyses indicated that the rabies virus P-protein selectively targeted tetrameric pY-STAT1. Combined with data showing which regions contribute to the interaction between pY-STAT1 and the P-protein, we constructed a binding model explaining how P recognizes the pY-STAT1 tetramer. These data provide insight into how pathogenic viruses target signaling pathways that mediate the host immune response.},

  abstract     = {In prostate cancers, the abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4 is inversely correlated with response to the antiandrogen (also known as an androgen receptor inhibitor) enzalutamide. Zhang et al. found that PDCD4 is repressed by the mitotic kinase PLK1, which enabled the activity of cell survival pathways that are androgen independent. In prostate cancer cell lines, PLK1 promoted the degradation of PDCD4, which released a brake on c-MYC, stimulating its activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and metabolic pathways that reduced cellular dependence on androgen receptor signaling and thus reduced sensitivity to enzalutamide. Treatment with the Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib restored enzalutamide sensitivity in tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that this may be an effective strategy in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Enzalutamide, a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor (also known as an antiandrogen), is used to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Tumors often acquire resistance to enzalutamide. Tumor progression and enzalutamide resistance are associated with decreased abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4. In normal dividing cells, PDCD4 abundance is low when that of the kinase PLK1 is high. In this study, we found that PLK1 acted on PDCD4 to promote enzalutamide resistance in CRPC cells in culture and in mice via a mechanism that revealed an effective combination therapy. PLK1 phosphorylated PDCD4 at Ser 239 , leading to its degradation and consequently inducing the transcriptional activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by c-MYC. Hh signaling supports tumor cell proliferation and stemness by inducing the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15), which promotes the metabolic clearance of drugs and steroid hormones. Thus, this pathway may circumvent androgen receptor dependence, thereby reducing cellular sensitivity to enzalutamide. Knocking down UGT2B15 enhanced enzalutamide-induced cell apoptosis and growth arrest in a PDCD4-dependent manner. Combining enzalutamide with the clinically approved Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in enzalutamide-resistant cell cultures and xenografts in vivo. Our findings reveal a mechanism of PLK1-mediated enzalutamide resistance and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance in prostate cancer.},
