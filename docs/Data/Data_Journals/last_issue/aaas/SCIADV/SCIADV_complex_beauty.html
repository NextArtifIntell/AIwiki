Aryl aldehydes could be used as latent benzyl carbanion equivalents via reductive polarity reversal. The key to the success of the asymmetric reaction was the combination of an achiral monophosphine ligand Ph 2 P(2-furyl) with a chiral diamine derivative, which enhanced the enantioselectivity and reactivity. Density functional theory calculations revealed the hydrogen bond interactions between the chiral diamine derivative, the achiral monophosphine ligand, and the base anion, which combined to induce the desired enantioselectivity. Moreover, further synthetic transformation of tertiary alcohols with high chirality transfer was also demonstrated.},

Here, we describe a nickel-catalyzed asymmetric radical-based electrochemical functionalization of silyl polyenolates at α-, γ-, ε-, and η-positions. Driven by electric current, this methodology provides a sustainable route to access enantioenriched dicarbonyls via vinylogous radical pathways. It demonstrates excellent functional groups tolerance, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate compatibility, formation of quaternary stereocenters at remote positions, and high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). Mechanistic investigations indicate that ferrocene-based electron transfer mediators are pivotal in the anodic oxidation process, facilitating the generation of nickel-bound α-carbonyl radicals while suppressing the undesired oxidation of silyl polyenolates, thus guiding the selection of mediators for electrocatalytic systems. The versatility of catalytic asymmetric electrosynthesis is highlighted by the preparation of valuable enantioenriched building blocks and the total synthesis of (-)-ethosuximide.},

Here, we report a head-mounted microscope for neurovascular imaging that enables the simultaneous recording of neuronal burst firing and multiparametric hemodynamics such as vascular oxygen saturation at high spatiotemporal resolution. The 1.7-gram lightweight microscope integrates confocal fluorescence and photoacoustic microscopy, allowing recordings at 0.78 hertz with 1.5-micrometer lateral resolution across a field of view of 400 micrometers by 400 micrometers. We identified cell type–specific neurovascular responses to hypoxic challenges, observed active regulation of arterioles during sensory stimuli, and detected abnormal oxygen depletion and vasodilation preceding burst neuronal discharges in epileptic disorders. This technique provides valuable insights into neurovascular coupling and holds potential for studying the pathology of neurological brain diseases.},

Here, we demonstrate ultranarrow-linewidth wavelength-vortex multiplexing holography in metasurface holograms. By applying elementary dispersion engineering, we develop a sparse k -vector–filtering aperture array in momentum space, enabling sharp wavelength selectivity combined with orbital angular momentum selectivity. Further leveraging transformer neural networks for the design of phase-only holograms, we showcase the reconstruction of up to 118 independent images from a single hologram, achieving a simulated ultranarrow linewidth of 2 nanometers within the visible range. We apply these developed metasurface holograms for holographic visual cryptography, attaining unprecedented security levels with an information rate over 2500 times higher than traditional methods.

However, the antibacterial activity of NCPs remains largely unknown. Here, we discovered a plant-derived noncanonical antibacterial peptide (NCBP1) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. NCBP1 is composed of 11 amino acid residues with cationic surface potential and favorable safety and stability. Mechanistic studies revealed that NCBP1 displayed antibacterial activity by targeting phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in bacterial membrane, resulting in membrane damage and dysfunction. Notably, NCBP1 showed promising efficacy in mice. Furthermore, NCBP1 effectively inhibited the growth of plant fungal pathogens and enhanced disease resistance in maize. Our results demonstrate the unexplored antimicrobial potential of plant-derived NCPs and provide an accessible source for the discovery of antimicrobial substances against MDR bacterial and fungal pathogens.},

Herein, an efficient purely organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) material, 3,2-PIC-TXT, with fast phosphorescence radiation is developed. It not only exhibits impressive EL performances as an emitter with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 33.2%, higher than that of Ir(ppy) 3 (25.2%), but also functions remarkably as a sensitizer for green MR-TADF emitters (BN2, tCzphB-Ph, and tCzphB-Fl).

Our analysis indicates a continuous deoxygenation in 83% of the studied lakes. The mean deoxygenation rate in global lakes (−0.049 milligrams per liter per decade) is faster than that observed in the oceans and in rivers. By decreasing solubility, climatic warming contributes 55% of global lake deoxygenation. Meanwhile, heatwaves exert rapid influences on DO decline, resulting in a 7.7% deoxygenation compared to that observed under climatological mean temperatures. By the end of the century, global lake DO is projected to decrease by 0.41 milligrams per liter (4.3%) under SSP2-4.5 and 0.86 milligrams per liter (8.8%) under SSP5-8.5 scenarios.},

They superimpose waves with a mutual phase delay, modifying light intensity. A frequency-dependent phase delay enables spectral shaping for filtering, routing, wave shaping, or multiplexing. Conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometers generate sinusoidal output intensities, limiting spectral engineering capabilities. Here, we propose a framework that uses interference of multiple transverse modes within a single multimode waveguide to achieve arbitrary spectral shapes in a compact geometry. Designed corrugated gratings couple these modes, enabling energy exchange akin to a beam splitter for easy multimode handling. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate spectra with independently tunable linewidth and free spectral range, along with distinct spectral shapes for various transverse modes. Our method applies to orthogonal modes of different orders, polarization, and angular momentum, offering potential for sensing, calibration, metrology, and computing.},

  abstract     = {Optical imaging has long been dominated by traditional lens-based systems that, despite their success, are inherently limited by size, weight, and cost. Lensless imaging seeks to overcome these limitations by replacing lenses with thinner, lighter, and cheaper optical modulators and reconstructing images computationally, while facing trade-offs in image quality, artifacts, and flexibility inherent in traditional static modulation. Here, we propose a lensless imaging method with programmable Fresnel zone aperture (FZA), termed LIP. With a commercial liquid crystal display, we designed an integrated LIP module and demonstrated its capability of high-quality artifact-free reconstruction through dynamic modulation and offset-FZA parallel merging. Compared to static-modulation approaches, LIP achieves a 2.5× resolution enhancement and a 3 decibels improvement in signal-to-noise ratio in “static mode” while maintaining an interaction frame rate of 15 frames per second in “dynamic mode.” Experimental results demonstrate LIP’s potential as a miniaturized platform for versatile advanced imaging tasks like virtual reality and human-computer interaction.},

More than 1.5 million people contract HCV each year, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, including American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). While direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective, timely and accurate HCV diagnosis remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. The current two-step HCV testing process is costly and time-intensive, often leading to patient loss before treatment. Point-of-care (POC) HCV antigen (Ag) testing offers a promising alternative, but no FDA-approved test meets the required sensitivity and specificity. To address this, we developed a fully automated, smartphone-based POC HCV Ag assay using platinum nanoparticles, deep learning image processing, and microfluidics. With an overall accuracy of 94.59%, this cost-effective, portable device has the potential to reduce HCV-related health disparities, particularly among AI/AN populations, improving accessibility and equity in care.},

  abstract     = {It has been demonstrated that monazite-type materials are excellent candidates for nuclear waste forms, and hence, their facile synthesis is of great importance for the needed sequestration of existing nuclear waste. The synthesis of monazite, LaPO 4 , requires inconveniently high temperatures near 1000°C and generally involves the conversion of the presynthesized rhabdophane, LaPO 4 •nH 2 O, to the LaPO 4 monazite phase. During this structure transformation, the rhabdophane converts irreversibly to the thermodynamically stable monoclinic monazite structure. A low-temperature (185° to 260°C) mild hydrothermal acid-promoted synthesis of monazite is described that can both transform presynthesized rhabdophane or assemble reagents to the monoclinic monazite structure. The pH dependence of this reaction is detailed, and its applicability to the Ln PO 4 ( Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm-Gd), Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 , and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 systems is discussed. The crystal growth of Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 is described, and their crystal structures were reported.

Here, we propose an innovative concept of selective antibacterial starvation therapy based on interfering with proton and electron transfer on the bacterial membrane. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, a special Schottky heterojunction film composed of gold and alkaline magnesium-iron mixed metal oxides (Au/MgFe-MMO) was constructed on the titanium implant. Once bacteria contacted this implant, the Au/MgFe-MMO film continuously captured the proton and electron participated in respiratory chain of bacteria to impede their energy metabolism, leading to the deficit of adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Prolonged exposure to this starvation state inhibited numerous biosynthesis processes and triggered severe oxidative stress in bacteria, ultimately leading to their death due to DNA and membrane damage. In addition, this heterojunction film was comfortable for mammalian cells, without inhibiting mitochondrial function. This proposed starvation antibacterial therapy gives a notable perspective in designing biosafe smart antibacterial biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (T regs ) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes T regs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD + with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing T regs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral T regs , sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD + axis disrupts T regs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.},

Here, we identified an SlKD1-interacting transcription factor GATA transcription factor 6 (SlGATA6), which is required for maintaining the auxin-response gradient and preventing abscission. SlGATA6 up-regulates the expression of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 . The AUXIN RESISTANT/LIKE AUXIN RESISTANT (AUX/LAX) proteins SlLAX2-dependent asymmetric auxin distribution causes differential accumulation of Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid 3 (SlIAA3) and its homolog SlIAA32 across different abscission zone cells. It is also required for SUMOylation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2a (SlARF2a), a key suppressor of auxin signaling and abscission initiator. Moreover, SlIAA3 and SlIAA32 depress SUMOylated SlARF2a, thus suppressing SlARF2a function. The interaction between SlKD1 and SlGATA6 suppresses SlGATA6 binding to the promoters of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 , thereby disrupting the auxin-response gradient and triggering abscission. This regulatory mechanism is conserved under low light–induced abscission in diverse Solanaceae plants. Our findings reveal a critical role of SlKD1 in modulating the auxin-response gradient and abscission initiation.},

By concurrently increasing cross-link sites and dynamic bond contents, this approach fabricates polymer networks with high cross-link density yet low processing temperature, challenging the conventional structure-property relationship where cross-linking inherently limits plasticity. Notably, the material demonstrates remarkable processability, evidenced by the ratio of G ′ max to G ′ min with a temperature differential (Δ T ) of 120°C (which signifies the soft-to-hard transition capability). This ratio reaches 153.3, higher than all reported cross-linked polyurethanes.

Herein, we developed a cell/drug-free strategy to selectively boost endogenous sensory innervation to harness immune responses for promoting tissue rehabilitation. Specifically, a dual-functional phage was constructed with a sensory nerve–homing peptide and a β-subunit of nerve growth factor (β-NGF)–binding peptide. These double-displayed phages captured endogenic β-NGF and localized to sensory nerves to promote sensory innervation. Furthermore, regarding bone regeneration, phage-loaded hydrogels achieved rapid sensory nerve ingrowth in bone defect areas. Mechanistically, sensory neurotization facilitated M2 polarization of macrophages through the Sema3A/XIAP/PAX6 pathway, thus decreasing the M1/M2 ratio to induce the dissipation of local inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight the essential role of sensory innervation in manipulating inflammation and provide a conceptual framework based on neuroimmune interactions for promoting tissue regeneration.},

We demonstrate that the metabolism of the paradigmatic medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid leads to a metabolic shift toward the SOG and methionine pathways. PHGDH plays a role in both the forward direction, contributing to the production of S-adenosylmethionine, and the reverse direction, generating the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to epigenomic reprogramming and phenotypic plasticity. The methionine cycle is closely linked to the transsulfuration pathway. Consequently, we observe that the shift increases the antioxidant glutathione, which mitigates reactive oxygen species (ROS), enabling survival of a subset of cells that have undergone DNA damage. These metabolic changes contribute to several hallmarks of cancer.},

Here, we defined the transcriptional regulators and epigenetic circuitry of Galectin-9 in pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), as an example of a disease with strong Galectin-9 expression, in which higher expression was associated with lower overall survival. By performing a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified the transcription factors IRF1 and TFAP4 as key regulators for Galectin-9 expression by binding its regulatory elements. Whereas IRF1 was observed exclusively on the promoter, TFAP4 binding was detected at an enhancer solely in T-ALL cells associated with higher Galectin-9 levels. Together, our results show that IRF1 is responsible and indispensable for Galectin-9 expression and TFAP4 further fine-tunes its expression. Our approach, a flow-based genome-wide CRISPR screen complemented by transcription factor binding and enhancer mapping, creates innovative opportunities for understanding and manipulating epigenetic transcriptional regulation in cancer.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy, a neurological disorder marked by recurrent, unprovoked seizures, is often linked to dysregulated iron metabolism, resulting in iron overload and subsequent cellular dysfunction or death within epileptogenic regions. We proposed a specific, noninvasive technique using paramagnetic susceptibility imaging via magnetic resonance imaging to quantify in vivo brain iron levels, aiming to enhance our understanding of epilepsy pathology and improve diagnostic accuracy. Our imaging and histopathological studies demonstrated that paramagnetic susceptibility is a sensitive biomarker for iron quantification in epilepsy. This method effectively detects iron abnormality from various causes and highlights that iron alters within epileptogenic zones, indicating the presence of potentially salvageable tissue. Furthermore, iron accumulation was observed to disrupt cortical laminar structures in epileptogenic zones and was associated with the proliferation of central nervous system cells, particularly astrocytes. Paramagnetic susceptibility imaging provides previously unknown insights into epilepsy, offering potential applications in diagnostics, monitoring, and personalized treatment strategies.},

Inspired by the natural electrosensory capabilities of electrogenic fishes, we introduce an organic electrosense transistor designed to detect electric fields generated by nearby objects, facilitating the creation of impalpable perception systems. Unlike traditional sensors, our electrosense transistor perceives bipolar electric fields with high sensitivity and stability. We use compact models and device simulations to elucidate the mechanisms of charge induction and transport within organic electrosense transistors when exposed to spatial electric fields. Demonstrating its practical utility, we show that robots equipped with our electrosense transistor can successfully navigate and detect concealed objects without requiring direct contact. This work not only advances the understanding of charge dynamics in electrosensory systems but also establishes a platform for developing highly sensitive, noninvasive artificial sensing technologies applicable in surveillance, search and rescue, and other challenging environments.},

However, the presence of nonuniform geometric effects would be induced to impact the nonuniform geometric distribution of overpotential, leading to impurity dissolution and nonuniform Ti deposition. Here, in situ high-temperature characterizations on the molten salt electrorefining process are applied to establish an anodic dissolution principle for quantitatively evaluating nonuniform geometric effects of electrode. For eliminating the nonuniform geometric effects, coaxial anode-cathode configurations are designed to promote the nonuniform anodic dissolution and nonuniform cathodic deposition. Consequently, the geometric uniformity of titanium products on the cathodes is substantially enhanced, and thus, long-term stable electrorefining process (~12 hours, ~330% increment compared to the electrode of reference configuration) and highly purified titanium products (99.2%) are achieved.},

It also improved cerebral and multiorgan perfusion. Mechanistically, LIPUS activated pathways related to sympathetic nerve excitation and vascular smooth muscle contraction, increasing plasma catecholamines and stimulating blood pressure–regulating neural nuclei. Partial sympathetic nerve transection reduced LIPUS efficacy, while complete inhibition of these nuclei abolished the response. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated LIPUS’s ability to raise blood pressure in shock patients. The findings suggest that LIPUS enhances sympathetic nerve activity and activates blood pressure–regulating nuclei, offering a noninvasive, neuromodulation-based approach to shock treatment. This method holds potential for improving blood pressure and organ perfusion in shock patients, especially in resource-limited environments.},

Here, we have established an in vivo time-resolved imaging platform to continuously visualize cellulose biosynthesis and fibril network assembly on Arabidopsis thaliana protoplast surfaces as the primary cell wall regenerates. Our observations provide the basis for a model of cellulose fibril network development in protoplasts driven by an interplay of multiscale dynamics that includes rapid diffusion and coalescence of nascent cellulose fibrils, processive elongation of single fibrils, and cellulose fibrillar network rearrangement during maturation.

  abstract     = {Malaria, one of the most serious infectious diseases worldwide, is caused by the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites through repeated cycles of intraerythrocytic development. The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 in Plasmodium berghei (PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption of pbsip2 resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN 4–6 GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites.},

These hydrogels exhibit mechanical properties comparable with biological tissues, reducing adverse immune responses. The hydrogels can be patterned on elastic substrates using a simple, low-cost micromolding technique to fabricate soft and stretchable implantable devices for electrical stimulation and recording. The hydrogel electrodes show much lower electrochemical impedance and higher charge storage and injection capacity compared to platinum electrodes. In addition, the properties of hydrogels and devices remain stable after long-term storage and exposure to extreme conditions.

Such a shape is universal, prevailing in many diverse synchronized systems. Theoretical studies suggest that, under strong external forcing, the shape of the synchronization regions can change substantially and even holes can appear in the solid patterns. However, experimentally accessing these abnormal regimes is quite challenging mainly because many real-world systems displaying synchronization become fragile under strong forcing. Here, we are able to observe these intriguing regimes in a breathing-soliton laser. Two types of abnormal synchronization regions are unveiled, namely, a leaf- and a ray-like shape. High-resolution control of the loss allows holes to be revealed in the synchronization regions.

Concurrent knockout of Thumpd1 and the stress-sensing kinase Gcn2 causes penetrant postnatal lethality in mice, indicating a critical genetic interaction.

This mechanism exhibits low robustness due to its high dependence on the physical properties and flow conditions of fluids. Here, we report a robust emulsification mechanism—wetting-induced interfacial instability—for droplet emission. We find that, when pendant microdroplets in the air contact with an immiscible wetting bulk phase, it triggers interfacial instability in the hanging droplets and then their rapid breakup into the bulk phase. This simplifies the monodisperse microdroplet production using a nozzle positioned above an air-liquid interface, requiring no complex microchannels. We demonstrate that this method exhibits highly scalable production and exceptional robustness against variations in physical properties and flow conditions of fluids, including highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid (56,600 millipascal-seconds). This mechanism provides a simpler alternative to the traditional Rayleigh-Plateau instability for emulsification, offering opportunities for industrial applications and insights into microscale interfacial science.},

Here, we have designed a hierarchical Si-based photocathode for l -Phe synthesis by photoelectrochemical coupling of waste CO 2 and nitrophenyl ethane, achieving a high yield rate of 37.5 μg·hour −1 ·cm −2 and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 21.2% at low applied potential under 1 sun illumination. The hierarchical structure with CuO-TiO 2 -C mixtures dispersed in amorphous TiO 2 layer/n + p-Si creates an internal built-in electric field and forms plentiful conducting channels to efficiently realize the injection of electrons into Cu and Ti sites. These Cu and Ti sites adsorb and activate the CO 2 and nitrophenyl ethane, respectively, cooperatively facilitating the l -Phe synthesis.

  abstract     = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with kidney diseases, but the causal variants, genes, and pathways involved remain elusive. Here, we identified a kidney disease gene called pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF) through integrating GWAS on kidney function and multiomic analysis. PPDPF was predominantly expressed in healthy proximal tubules of human and mouse kidneys via single-cell analysis. Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD + levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD + and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries. Consequently, knockout of PPDPF notably accelerated the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mouse models induced by aging, chemical exposure, and obstruction. These findings strongly support targeting PPDPF as a potential therapy for kidney fibrosis, offering possibilities for future CKD interventions.},

  abstract     = {The amplified wintertime Arctic warming has accelerated in recent decades. However, whether and how the warming can cause Eurasian cooling remains debated. By identifying daily Arctic warming events, we find direct observational evidence that the Arctic warming tends to cause substantial Eurasian cooling and an increase in occurrence frequency of Eurasian cooling events with a roughly 2-day lag. We propose a mechanism explaining the causality. We find that the Arctic warming causes a large suppression in activities of daily weather disturbances (referred to as synoptic eddies) over high-latitude Eurasia. This produces a meridional dipole in geopotential height anomalies characterized by an equivalent-barotropic anomalous low (high) and a lower-level cooling (warming) over mid-latitude Eurasia (the Arctic) via a nonlinear eddy–to–mean flow feedback. The feedback induces near-surface northeasterly anomalies that enlarge the Eurasian cooling via cold advection. Thus, we conclude that the warm Arctic versus cold Eurasia is essentially an intrinsic dipole determined by synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction.},

This process has traditionally been explained through the model of long-range Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this study, we demonstrate a donor-to-acceptor short-range energy transfer (SRET) mechanism in OPV blends with non-fullerene acceptors, extending beyond the Förster approximation. This SRET occurs as a two-step process mediated by interfacial excitations with mixed charge-transfer and local excitation features. We further validate this model through studies on planar heterojunctions, precisely controlling the thickness of interlayers. These findings underscore the short-range interactions in regulating the donor-to-acceptor energy transfer in OPV blends, suggesting that SRET should be considered alongside FRET and charge-transfer processes for device optimizations.},

Spd-2/CEP192 proteins, defined by a conserved “Spd-2 domain” (SP2D) comprising two closely spaced AspM-Spd-2-Hydin (ASH) domains, play a critical role in centrosome assembly. Here, we show that the SP2D does not target Drosophila Spd-2 to centrosomes but rather promotes PCM scaffold assembly. Crystal structures of the human and honeybee SP2D reveal an unusual “extended cradle” structure mediated by a conserved interaction interface between the two ASH domains. Mutations predicted to perturb this interface, including a human mutation associated with male infertility and Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy, disrupt PCM scaffold assembly in flies. The SP2D is monomeric in solution, but the Drosophila SP2D can form higher-order oligomers upon phosphorylation by PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1). Crystal-packing interactions and AlphaFold predictions suggest how SP2Ds might self-assemble, and mutations associated with one such potential dimerization interface markedly perturb SP2D oligomerization in vitro and PCM scaffold assembly in vivo.},

To examine this, we use rain and aerosol Hg speciation data and high-resolution surface DMHg measurements, collected on a transect from Alaskan coastal waters to the Bering and Chukchi Seas. We observed a significant fivefold increase in the MeHg:THg fraction in rain and a 10-fold increase for aerosols, closely linked to elevated surface DMHg and the highest DMHg evasion (~9.4 picomoles per square meter per hour) found in upwelling waters near the Aleutian Islands. These data highlight a previously underexplored aspect of MeHg air-sea exchange and its importance to Hg cycling and human health concerns. Our findings emphasize the importance of DMHg evasion by demonstrating that atmospheric MeHg can be transported long distances (~1700 kilometers) in the Arctic, posing risks to human health and ecosystems.},

However, the in vivo metabolic pathways of NMN and NR remain to be elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the fate of orally and intravenously administered NMN and NR in mice using NAD + metabolomics. We found that only a small portion of orally administered NMN and NR was directly absorbed from the small intestine and that most of them underwent gut microbiota–mediated deamidation and conversion to nicotinic acid (NA). Moreover, intravenously administered NMN and NR were rapidly degraded into nicotinamide and secreted to bile followed by deamidation to NA by gut microbiota. Thus, enterohepatic circulated NA is preferentially used in the liver. These findings showed that NMN and NR are indirectly converted to NAD + via unexpected metabolic pathways.},

Current models depict a global connection between mRNA synthesis and degradation, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that changes in RNA metabolism following depletion of TIP60/KAT5, the acetyltransferase subunit of the NuA4 transcriptional coactivator complex, reveal that transcript buffering occurs at a gene-specific level. By combining RNA sequencing of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and newly synthesized transcript fractions with biophysical modeling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that transcriptional changes caused by TIP60 depletion are offset by corresponding changes in RNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability, indicating gene-specific buffering. Disruption of the unrelated ATAC coactivator complex also causes gene-specific transcript buffering. We propose that cells dynamically adjust RNA splicing, export, and degradation in response to individual RNA synthesis alterations, thereby sustaining cellular homeostasis.},

Structure-activity relationship studies of an initial cadherin-binding peptide [ CBP ; apparent dissociation constant ( K d ) = 53 nanomolar] reveal residues responsible for driving affinity (hotspots) and mutation-tolerant residues (coldspots). Two original macrocyclic libraries are prepared in which these hotspots and coldspots are derivatized with nonnatural amino acids. Following discovery and validation, high-affinity ligands are discovered from the coldspot library, with NCBP-4 demonstrating improved affinity ( K d = 29 nanomolar).

Using compound-class radiocarbon analysis, molecular characterization, and bioassay experiments, we provide direct evidence for rapid microbial utilization of young, labile, high–molecular weight proteinaceous material in bathypelagic waters. The abundance of labile proteinaceous material diminishes from epipelagic to mesopelagic waters but notably increases in bathypelagic waters, where it exhibits a short turnover time (days) and resembles surface plankton in molecular composition. This observation coincides with peak zooplankton biomass recorded over the year. The nonmonotonic depth trend suggests a deep-sea replenishment of organic particles from mesopelagic migrating zooplankton.

Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 kelvin and dominates transport properties below 150 kelvin, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB 6 and YbB 12 . At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected.

  abstract     = {Whether the rapid warming of the Arctic, particularly the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS), substantially affects the Eurasian winter climate has been debated for over a decade. Here, we use an extended dynamical adjustment method to separate the effects of internal dynamics and thermodynamically forced BKS warming on atmospheric circulation, relying solely on observations. Evidence shows that the observed link between BKS warming and Eurasian cooling is influenced by both atmospheric internal variability and forced BKS warming. Internal variability, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly contributed to the observed Eurasian cooling from 1991 to 2012. While BKS warming has a weaker impact on Eurasian cooling on interannual to interdecadal timescales, it notably affects multidecadal scales, contributing to the observed “warming hole” in central Eurasia during 1980–2022. Our findings suggest a weak but non-negligible Eurasian cooling response to BKS warming on multidecadal timescales. These findings advance the understanding of the complex causal relationships between Arctic and mid-latitude climates.},

  abstract     = {Endoreplication is characterized by multiple rounds of DNA replication without cell division and determines the growth and final size of endoreplicating cells and tissues in eukaryotes. The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicating Drosophila salivary gland and Bombyx silk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr. Together, our study demonstrates that USP8 and Hsp70 regulate endoreplication by synergistically maintaining Fzr stability though deubiquitination.},

To explore their potential as detectors for ultrabroadband terahertz electromagnetic pulses, we measure the transient optical birefringence the terahertz field induces. Notably, the signal component linear in the FM magnetization agrees excellently with the shape of the incident terahertz electric field at 1 to 13 terahertz and beyond. Analysis indicates that the birefringence arises from the terahertz-field–driven spin accumulation at the FM/HM interface through the spin Rashba-Edelstein effect (SREE). Because of spin-momentum locking, the SREE decays by electron momentum relaxation in &lt;10 femtoseconds, substantially faster than a spin-Hall-effect–induced bulk spin accumulation. Our experiment demonstrates straightforward spintronic sampling of intense ultrabroadband terahertz fields with flat amplitude and phase response. Furthermore, it provides temporal signatures of the SREE and can be viewed as a versatile implementation of interface-specific terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.},

The β 2 -adrenergic receptor is an example of GPCR with high selectivity for Gαs, the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase, and much weaker for the Gαi family of G proteins inhibiting adenylyl cyclase. By developing a Gαi-biased agonist (LM189), we provide structural and biophysical evidence supporting that distinct conformations at ICL2 and TM6 are required for coupling of the different G protein subtypes Gαs and Gαi.

  abstract     = {Nicotine is an addictive substance that poses substantial health and societal challenges. Despite the known links between the medial habenula (MHb) and nicotine avoidance, the ionic mechanisms underlying MHb neuronal responses to nicotine remain unclear. Here, we report that MHb neurons use a long-lasting refractory period (LLRP) as an unconventional inhibitory mechanism to curb hyperexcitability. This process is initiated by nicotine-induced calcium influx through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which activates a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). Owing to high intracellular chloride levels in MHb neurons, chloride efflux through CaCC, coupled with high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels, sustains MHb depolarization near the chloride equilibrium potential of −30 millivolts, thereby enabling LLRP. Concurrently, calcium-activated BK potassium channels counteract this depolarization, promoting LLRP termination. Our findings reveal an atypical inhibitory mechanism, orchestrated by synergistic actions between calcium-permeable and calcium-activated channels. This discovery advances our understanding of neuronal excitability control and nicotine addiction.},

In this study, we characterized the function of y + LAT1-4F2hc complex in mammalian cells and determined the cryo-EM structures of the human y + LAT1-4F2hc complex in two distinct conformations: the apo state in an inward-open conformation and the native substrate-bound state in an outward-open conformation. Structural analysis suggests that Asp 243 in y + LAT1 plays a crucial role in coordination with sodium ion and substrate selectivity. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations further revealed the different transport mechanism of cationic amino acids and neutral amino acids. These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the substrate binding and working cycle of HATs.},

While these neural processes converge in the temporal cortex, the nature of their interactions remains largely unclear. Here, we systematically investigated the interplay between visual attention and stimulus feature coding by training macaques to perform a free-gaze visual search task with natural stimuli. Recording from a large number of units across multiple brain areas, we found that units exhibiting visual feature coding showed stronger attentional modulation of responses and spike–local field potential coherence than units without feature coding. Across brain areas, attention directed toward search targets enhanced the neuronal pattern separation of stimuli, with this enhancement more pronounced for units encoding visual features. Together, our results suggest a complex interplay between visual feature and attention coding in the primate brain, likely driven by interactions between brain areas engaged in these processes.},

We show that CD4 + CD57 + PD1 + T cells emerge in stable patients, conferring risks for ALAD, CLAD, and death. These cells are senescent, secrete inflammatory cytokines, and fall into two oligoclonal subsets with putative cytotoxic and follicular helper functions. Last, they are associated with fibrosis in mouse and human lung allografts, where they localize near airway epithelium and B cells.

Intriguingly, cell cycles of host and endosymbiont are synchronized. The molecular mechanisms underlying this notable level of integration are unknown. Previously, we identified a nucleus-encoded dynamin-like protein, called ETP9, that localizes at the endosymbiont division site of A. deanei . Here, we found by comparative genomics that endosymbionts throughout the Strigomonadinae lost the capacity to autonomously form a division septum. We describe the cell cycle–dependent subcellular localization of ETP9 that follows accumulation of the bacterium-encoded division protein FtsZ at the endosymbiont division site. Furthermore, we found that ETP9 is essential in symbiotic but dispensable in aposymbiotic A. deanei that lost the endosymbiont. In the symbiotic strain, ETP9 knockdowns resulted in filamentous, division-impaired endosymbionts. Our work unveiled that in A. deanei an endosymbiont division machinery of dual genetic origin evolved in which a neo-functionalized host protein compensates for losses of endosymbiont division genes.},

Using online measurement methods that impinge particles for OP quantification within seconds, we reveal that 60 to 99% of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and OP in secondary organic aerosol and combustion-generated PM have a lifetime of minutes to hours and that the ROS activity of ambient PM decays substantially before offline analysis. This implies that current offline measurement methods substantially underestimate the true OP of PM. We demonstrate that short-lived OP components activate different toxicity pathways upon direct deposition onto reconstituted human bronchial epithelia. Therefore, we suggest that future air pollution and health studies should include online OP quantification, allowing more accurate assessments of links between OP and health effects.},

This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler’s ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out-of-equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to d -dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path toward the study of competitive events in complex media.},

We propose that photoacoustic sensing in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window can enable deep tissue sensing as acoustic waves scatter less than light. To achieve this, we developed a photoacoustic polarization–enhanced optical rotation sensing (PAPEORS) system, capable of estimating optical rotation from photoacoustic signals and correlating it with chiral molecular concentration for depths up to 3.5 mm. Experiments were conducted using aqueous glucose solutions, naproxen, serum-based glucose samples, and ex vivo chicken tissue. PAPEORS achieved a detection limit of 80 mg/dl while using circularly polarized light with serum samples, demonstrating the potential for deep-tissue chiral molecular sensing. PAPEORS holds promise for in vivo sensing and easy miniaturization using single wavelength.},

However, the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Craniofacial integument displays dramatic diversity, exemplified by the Polish chicken (PC) with a homeotic transformation of comb-to-crest feathers, caused by a 195–base pair (bp) duplication in HoxC10 intron. Micro-C analyses show that HoxC-containing topologically associating domain (TAD) is normally closed in the scalp but open in the dorsal and tail regions, allowing multiple long-distance contacts. In the PC scalp, the TAD is open, resulting in high HoxC expression. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the 195-bp duplication reduces crest feather formation, and HoxC misexpression alters feather shapes. The 195-bp sequence is found only in Archelosauria (crocodilians and birds) and not in mammals.

  abstract     = {The constrained cross-talk between myeloid cells and T cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) restricts cancer immunotherapy efficacy, whereas the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2 −/− signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor. Our findings uncover Parkin’s involvement in suppressing macrophage antigen presentation for coordinating the cross-talk between macrophages and T cells.},

  abstract     = {The self-assembly of bacteriophage capsids from major capsid proteins (MCPs) and scaffolding proteins (SPs) and the subsequent expansion of these capsids are essential steps in bacteriophage life cycles. However, the mechanism by which assembly occurs remains poorly understood, and few intermediate states are available to illuminate the expansion of meta-stable procapsids into robust mature capsids. Here, we present the structure of a partially expanded phi29 procapsid that reveals distinct conformations of MCPs and allows visualization of SPs in multiple oligomeric states. These results suggest that formation of SP dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers drives dissociation of SP from MCP to actuate capsid expansion. Hexons expand first, and we propose penton maturation is delayed by a symmetry match with SP oligomers. We further show that the prolate shape of phi29’s capsid is possible due to concave hexons in the equatorial region of the capsid that may alter interactions with SP and explain the observed dependence of the prolate shape on SP.},

  abstract     = {Acute organ injuries represent a major public health concern, driven by inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to cell damage and organ failure. In this study, we engineered neutrophil membrane–fused mitochondria (nMITO), which combine the injury-targeting and anti-inflammatory properties of neutrophil membrane proteins with the cell repairing function of mitochondria. nMITO effectively blocked inflammatory cascades and restored mitochondrial function, targeting both key mechanisms in acute organ injuries. In addition, nMITO selectively targeted damaged endothelial cells via β-integrins and were delivered to injured tissues through tunneling nanotubes, enhancing their regulatory effects on inflammation and cell damage. In mouse models of acute myocardial injury, liver injury, and pancreatitis, nMITO notably reduced inflammatory responses and repaired tissue damage. These findings suggest that nMITO is a promising therapeutic strategy for managing acute organ injuries.},

  abstract     = {Therapies to reduce neuroinflammation following resolution of acute central nervous system (CNS) infections are urgently needed, particularly for patients with non–HIV-associated cryptococcal meningoencephalitis complicated by a postinfectious inflammatory response syndrome (cPIIRS). To identify druggable targets in cPIIRS, patient cerebral spinal fluid samples underwent transcriptional analysis, revealing a Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway dominance in neuroinflammatory gene signatures. MurinecPIIRS models recapitulated this pathway predominance and treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, confirmed a mechanistic requirement for this pathway in disease pathology. Ruxolitinib treatment improved markers of neuronal damage, reduced activated T cell and myeloid cells, and improved weight. On the basis of these findings, we conducted a first-in-human ruxolitinib treatment of patients with cPIIRS (NCT00001352). Ruxolitinib treatment of six patients led to demonstrated tolerability, reductions in inflammatory biomarkers and activated immune cells, and improved brain imaging. These results advocate for pathway-instructed therapeutics in neuroinflammatory diseases and endorse JAK inhibitors in further clinical studies of cPIIRS.},
