Aryl aldehydes could be used as latent benzyl carbanion equivalents via reductive polarity reversal. The key to the success of the asymmetric reaction was the combination of an achiral monophosphine ligand Ph 2 P(2-furyl) with a chiral diamine derivative, which enhanced the enantioselectivity and reactivity. Density functional theory calculations revealed the hydrogen bond interactions between the chiral diamine derivative, the achiral monophosphine ligand, and the base anion, which combined to induce the desired enantioselectivity. Moreover, further synthetic transformation of tertiary alcohols with high chirality transfer was also demonstrated.},

Here, we describe a nickel-catalyzed asymmetric radical-based electrochemical functionalization of silyl polyenolates at α-, γ-, ε-, and η-positions. Driven by electric current, this methodology provides a sustainable route to access enantioenriched dicarbonyls via vinylogous radical pathways. It demonstrates excellent functional groups tolerance, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate compatibility, formation of quaternary stereocenters at remote positions, and high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). Mechanistic investigations indicate that ferrocene-based electron transfer mediators are pivotal in the anodic oxidation process, facilitating the generation of nickel-bound α-carbonyl radicals while suppressing the undesired oxidation of silyl polyenolates, thus guiding the selection of mediators for electrocatalytic systems. The versatility of catalytic asymmetric electrosynthesis is highlighted by the preparation of valuable enantioenriched building blocks and the total synthesis of (-)-ethosuximide.},

Here, we report a head-mounted microscope for neurovascular imaging that enables the simultaneous recording of neuronal burst firing and multiparametric hemodynamics such as vascular oxygen saturation at high spatiotemporal resolution. The 1.7-gram lightweight microscope integrates confocal fluorescence and photoacoustic microscopy, allowing recordings at 0.78 hertz with 1.5-micrometer lateral resolution across a field of view of 400 micrometers by 400 micrometers. We identified cell type–specific neurovascular responses to hypoxic challenges, observed active regulation of arterioles during sensory stimuli, and detected abnormal oxygen depletion and vasodilation preceding burst neuronal discharges in epileptic disorders. This technique provides valuable insights into neurovascular coupling and holds potential for studying the pathology of neurological brain diseases.},

By applying elementary dispersion engineering, we develop a sparse k -vector–filtering aperture array in momentum space, enabling sharp wavelength selectivity combined with orbital angular momentum selectivity. Further leveraging transformer neural networks for the design of phase-only holograms, we showcase the reconstruction of up to 118 independent images from a single hologram, achieving a simulated ultranarrow linewidth of 2 nanometers within the visible range. We apply these developed metasurface holograms for holographic visual cryptography, attaining unprecedented security levels with an information rate over 2500 times higher than traditional methods.

However, the antibacterial activity of NCPs remains largely unknown. Here, we discovered a plant-derived noncanonical antibacterial peptide (NCBP1) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. NCBP1 is composed of 11 amino acid residues with cationic surface potential and favorable safety and stability. Mechanistic studies revealed that NCBP1 displayed antibacterial activity by targeting phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in bacterial membrane, resulting in membrane damage and dysfunction. Notably, NCBP1 showed promising efficacy in mice. Furthermore, NCBP1 effectively inhibited the growth of plant fungal pathogens and enhanced disease resistance in maize. Our results demonstrate the unexplored antimicrobial potential of plant-derived NCPs and provide an accessible source for the discovery of antimicrobial substances against MDR bacterial and fungal pathogens.},

Herein, an efficient purely organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) material, 3,2-PIC-TXT, with fast phosphorescence radiation is developed. It not only exhibits impressive EL performances as an emitter with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 33.2%, higher than that of Ir(ppy) 3 (25.2%), but also functions remarkably as a sensitizer for green MR-TADF emitters (BN2, tCzphB-Ph, and tCzphB-Fl).

Our analysis indicates a continuous deoxygenation in 83% of the studied lakes. The mean deoxygenation rate in global lakes (−0.049 milligrams per liter per decade) is faster than that observed in the oceans and in rivers. By decreasing solubility, climatic warming contributes 55% of global lake deoxygenation. Meanwhile, heatwaves exert rapid influences on DO decline, resulting in a 7.7% deoxygenation compared to that observed under climatological mean temperatures. By the end of the century, global lake DO is projected to decrease by 0.41 milligrams per liter (4.3%) under SSP2-4.5 and 0.86 milligrams per liter (8.8%) under SSP5-8.5 scenarios.},

They superimpose waves with a mutual phase delay, modifying light intensity. A frequency-dependent phase delay enables spectral shaping for filtering, routing, wave shaping, or multiplexing. Conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometers generate sinusoidal output intensities, limiting spectral engineering capabilities. Here, we propose a framework that uses interference of multiple transverse modes within a single multimode waveguide to achieve arbitrary spectral shapes in a compact geometry. Designed corrugated gratings couple these modes, enabling energy exchange akin to a beam splitter for easy multimode handling. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate spectra with independently tunable linewidth and free spectral range, along with distinct spectral shapes for various transverse modes. Our method applies to orthogonal modes of different orders, polarization, and angular momentum, offering potential for sensing, calibration, metrology, and computing.},

  abstract     = {Optical imaging has long been dominated by traditional lens-based systems that, despite their success, are inherently limited by size, weight, and cost. Lensless imaging seeks to overcome these limitations by replacing lenses with thinner, lighter, and cheaper optical modulators and reconstructing images computationally, while facing trade-offs in image quality, artifacts, and flexibility inherent in traditional static modulation. Here, we propose a lensless imaging method with programmable Fresnel zone aperture (FZA), termed LIP. With a commercial liquid crystal display, we designed an integrated LIP module and demonstrated its capability of high-quality artifact-free reconstruction through dynamic modulation and offset-FZA parallel merging. Compared to static-modulation approaches, LIP achieves a 2.5× resolution enhancement and a 3 decibels improvement in signal-to-noise ratio in “static mode” while maintaining an interaction frame rate of 15 frames per second in “dynamic mode.” Experimental results demonstrate LIP’s potential as a miniaturized platform for versatile advanced imaging tasks like virtual reality and human-computer interaction.},

More than 1.5 million people contract HCV each year, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, including American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). While direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective, timely and accurate HCV diagnosis remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. The current two-step HCV testing process is costly and time-intensive, often leading to patient loss before treatment. Point-of-care (POC) HCV antigen (Ag) testing offers a promising alternative, but no FDA-approved test meets the required sensitivity and specificity. To address this, we developed a fully automated, smartphone-based POC HCV Ag assay using platinum nanoparticles, deep learning image processing, and microfluidics. With an overall accuracy of 94.59%, this cost-effective, portable device has the potential to reduce HCV-related health disparities, particularly among AI/AN populations, improving accessibility and equity in care.},

  abstract     = {It has been demonstrated that monazite-type materials are excellent candidates for nuclear waste forms, and hence, their facile synthesis is of great importance for the needed sequestration of existing nuclear waste. The synthesis of monazite, LaPO 4 , requires inconveniently high temperatures near 1000°C and generally involves the conversion of the presynthesized rhabdophane, LaPO 4 •nH 2 O, to the LaPO 4 monazite phase. During this structure transformation, the rhabdophane converts irreversibly to the thermodynamically stable monoclinic monazite structure. A low-temperature (185° to 260°C) mild hydrothermal acid-promoted synthesis of monazite is described that can both transform presynthesized rhabdophane or assemble reagents to the monoclinic monazite structure. The pH dependence of this reaction is detailed, and its applicability to the Ln PO 4 ( Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm-Gd), Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 , and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 systems is discussed. The crystal growth of Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 is described, and their crystal structures were reported.

Here, we propose an innovative concept of selective antibacterial starvation therapy based on interfering with proton and electron transfer on the bacterial membrane. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, a special Schottky heterojunction film composed of gold and alkaline magnesium-iron mixed metal oxides (Au/MgFe-MMO) was constructed on the titanium implant. Once bacteria contacted this implant, the Au/MgFe-MMO film continuously captured the proton and electron participated in respiratory chain of bacteria to impede their energy metabolism, leading to the deficit of adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Prolonged exposure to this starvation state inhibited numerous biosynthesis processes and triggered severe oxidative stress in bacteria, ultimately leading to their death due to DNA and membrane damage. In addition, this heterojunction film was comfortable for mammalian cells, without inhibiting mitochondrial function. This proposed starvation antibacterial therapy gives a notable perspective in designing biosafe smart antibacterial biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (T regs ) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes T regs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD + with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing T regs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral T regs , sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD + axis disrupts T regs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.},

Here, we identified an SlKD1-interacting transcription factor GATA transcription factor 6 (SlGATA6), which is required for maintaining the auxin-response gradient and preventing abscission. SlGATA6 up-regulates the expression of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 . The AUXIN RESISTANT/LIKE AUXIN RESISTANT (AUX/LAX) proteins SlLAX2-dependent asymmetric auxin distribution causes differential accumulation of Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid 3 (SlIAA3) and its homolog SlIAA32 across different abscission zone cells. It is also required for SUMOylation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2a (SlARF2a), a key suppressor of auxin signaling and abscission initiator. Moreover, SlIAA3 and SlIAA32 depress SUMOylated SlARF2a, thus suppressing SlARF2a function. The interaction between SlKD1 and SlGATA6 suppresses SlGATA6 binding to the promoters of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 , thereby disrupting the auxin-response gradient and triggering abscission. This regulatory mechanism is conserved under low light–induced abscission in diverse Solanaceae plants. Our findings reveal a critical role of SlKD1 in modulating the auxin-response gradient and abscission initiation.},

By concurrently increasing cross-link sites and dynamic bond contents, this approach fabricates polymer networks with high cross-link density yet low processing temperature, challenging the conventional structure-property relationship where cross-linking inherently limits plasticity. Notably, the material demonstrates remarkable processability, evidenced by the ratio of G ′ max to G ′ min with a temperature differential (Δ T ) of 120°C (which signifies the soft-to-hard transition capability). This ratio reaches 153.3, higher than all reported cross-linked polyurethanes.

Herein, we developed a cell/drug-free strategy to selectively boost endogenous sensory innervation to harness immune responses for promoting tissue rehabilitation. Specifically, a dual-functional phage was constructed with a sensory nerve–homing peptide and a β-subunit of nerve growth factor (β-NGF)–binding peptide. These double-displayed phages captured endogenic β-NGF and localized to sensory nerves to promote sensory innervation. Furthermore, regarding bone regeneration, phage-loaded hydrogels achieved rapid sensory nerve ingrowth in bone defect areas. Mechanistically, sensory neurotization facilitated M2 polarization of macrophages through the Sema3A/XIAP/PAX6 pathway, thus decreasing the M1/M2 ratio to induce the dissipation of local inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight the essential role of sensory innervation in manipulating inflammation and provide a conceptual framework based on neuroimmune interactions for promoting tissue regeneration.},

We demonstrate that the metabolism of the paradigmatic medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid leads to a metabolic shift toward the SOG and methionine pathways. PHGDH plays a role in both the forward direction, contributing to the production of S-adenosylmethionine, and the reverse direction, generating the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to epigenomic reprogramming and phenotypic plasticity. The methionine cycle is closely linked to the transsulfuration pathway. Consequently, we observe that the shift increases the antioxidant glutathione, which mitigates reactive oxygen species (ROS), enabling survival of a subset of cells that have undergone DNA damage. These metabolic changes contribute to several hallmarks of cancer.},

Here, we defined the transcriptional regulators and epigenetic circuitry of Galectin-9 in pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), as an example of a disease with strong Galectin-9 expression, in which higher expression was associated with lower overall survival. By performing a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified the transcription factors IRF1 and TFAP4 as key regulators for Galectin-9 expression by binding its regulatory elements. Whereas IRF1 was observed exclusively on the promoter, TFAP4 binding was detected at an enhancer solely in T-ALL cells associated with higher Galectin-9 levels. Together, our results show that IRF1 is responsible and indispensable for Galectin-9 expression and TFAP4 further fine-tunes its expression. Our approach, a flow-based genome-wide CRISPR screen complemented by transcription factor binding and enhancer mapping, creates innovative opportunities for understanding and manipulating epigenetic transcriptional regulation in cancer.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy, a neurological disorder marked by recurrent, unprovoked seizures, is often linked to dysregulated iron metabolism, resulting in iron overload and subsequent cellular dysfunction or death within epileptogenic regions. We proposed a specific, noninvasive technique using paramagnetic susceptibility imaging via magnetic resonance imaging to quantify in vivo brain iron levels, aiming to enhance our understanding of epilepsy pathology and improve diagnostic accuracy. Our imaging and histopathological studies demonstrated that paramagnetic susceptibility is a sensitive biomarker for iron quantification in epilepsy. This method effectively detects iron abnormality from various causes and highlights that iron alters within epileptogenic zones, indicating the presence of potentially salvageable tissue. Furthermore, iron accumulation was observed to disrupt cortical laminar structures in epileptogenic zones and was associated with the proliferation of central nervous system cells, particularly astrocytes. Paramagnetic susceptibility imaging provides previously unknown insights into epilepsy, offering potential applications in diagnostics, monitoring, and personalized treatment strategies.},

Inspired by the natural electrosensory capabilities of electrogenic fishes, we introduce an organic electrosense transistor designed to detect electric fields generated by nearby objects, facilitating the creation of impalpable perception systems. Unlike traditional sensors, our electrosense transistor perceives bipolar electric fields with high sensitivity and stability. We use compact models and device simulations to elucidate the mechanisms of charge induction and transport within organic electrosense transistors when exposed to spatial electric fields. Demonstrating its practical utility, we show that robots equipped with our electrosense transistor can successfully navigate and detect concealed objects without requiring direct contact. This work not only advances the understanding of charge dynamics in electrosensory systems but also establishes a platform for developing highly sensitive, noninvasive artificial sensing technologies applicable in surveillance, search and rescue, and other challenging environments.},

However, the presence of nonuniform geometric effects would be induced to impact the nonuniform geometric distribution of overpotential, leading to impurity dissolution and nonuniform Ti deposition. Here, in situ high-temperature characterizations on the molten salt electrorefining process are applied to establish an anodic dissolution principle for quantitatively evaluating nonuniform geometric effects of electrode. For eliminating the nonuniform geometric effects, coaxial anode-cathode configurations are designed to promote the nonuniform anodic dissolution and nonuniform cathodic deposition. Consequently, the geometric uniformity of titanium products on the cathodes is substantially enhanced, and thus, long-term stable electrorefining process (~12 hours, ~330% increment compared to the electrode of reference configuration) and highly purified titanium products (99.2%) are achieved.},

It also improved cerebral and multiorgan perfusion. Mechanistically, LIPUS activated pathways related to sympathetic nerve excitation and vascular smooth muscle contraction, increasing plasma catecholamines and stimulating blood pressure–regulating neural nuclei. Partial sympathetic nerve transection reduced LIPUS efficacy, while complete inhibition of these nuclei abolished the response. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated LIPUS’s ability to raise blood pressure in shock patients. The findings suggest that LIPUS enhances sympathetic nerve activity and activates blood pressure–regulating nuclei, offering a noninvasive, neuromodulation-based approach to shock treatment. This method holds potential for improving blood pressure and organ perfusion in shock patients, especially in resource-limited environments.},

Here, we have established an in vivo time-resolved imaging platform to continuously visualize cellulose biosynthesis and fibril network assembly on Arabidopsis thaliana protoplast surfaces as the primary cell wall regenerates. Our observations provide the basis for a model of cellulose fibril network development in protoplasts driven by an interplay of multiscale dynamics that includes rapid diffusion and coalescence of nascent cellulose fibrils, processive elongation of single fibrils, and cellulose fibrillar network rearrangement during maturation.

  abstract     = {Malaria, one of the most serious infectious diseases worldwide, is caused by the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites through repeated cycles of intraerythrocytic development. The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 in Plasmodium berghei (PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption of pbsip2 resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN 4–6 GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites.},

These hydrogels exhibit mechanical properties comparable with biological tissues, reducing adverse immune responses. The hydrogels can be patterned on elastic substrates using a simple, low-cost micromolding technique to fabricate soft and stretchable implantable devices for electrical stimulation and recording. The hydrogel electrodes show much lower electrochemical impedance and higher charge storage and injection capacity compared to platinum electrodes. In addition, the properties of hydrogels and devices remain stable after long-term storage and exposure to extreme conditions.

Such a shape is universal, prevailing in many diverse synchronized systems. Theoretical studies suggest that, under strong external forcing, the shape of the synchronization regions can change substantially and even holes can appear in the solid patterns. However, experimentally accessing these abnormal regimes is quite challenging mainly because many real-world systems displaying synchronization become fragile under strong forcing. Here, we are able to observe these intriguing regimes in a breathing-soliton laser. Two types of abnormal synchronization regions are unveiled, namely, a leaf- and a ray-like shape. High-resolution control of the loss allows holes to be revealed in the synchronization regions.

Concurrent knockout of Thumpd1 and the stress-sensing kinase Gcn2 causes penetrant postnatal lethality in mice, indicating a critical genetic interaction.

This mechanism exhibits low robustness due to its high dependence on the physical properties and flow conditions of fluids. Here, we report a robust emulsification mechanism—wetting-induced interfacial instability—for droplet emission. We find that, when pendant microdroplets in the air contact with an immiscible wetting bulk phase, it triggers interfacial instability in the hanging droplets and then their rapid breakup into the bulk phase. This simplifies the monodisperse microdroplet production using a nozzle positioned above an air-liquid interface, requiring no complex microchannels. We demonstrate that this method exhibits highly scalable production and exceptional robustness against variations in physical properties and flow conditions of fluids, including highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid (56,600 millipascal-seconds). This mechanism provides a simpler alternative to the traditional Rayleigh-Plateau instability for emulsification, offering opportunities for industrial applications and insights into microscale interfacial science.},

Here, we have designed a hierarchical Si-based photocathode for l -Phe synthesis by photoelectrochemical coupling of waste CO 2 and nitrophenyl ethane, achieving a high yield rate of 37.5 μg·hour −1 ·cm −2 and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 21.2% at low applied potential under 1 sun illumination. The hierarchical structure with CuO-TiO 2 -C mixtures dispersed in amorphous TiO 2 layer/n + p-Si creates an internal built-in electric field and forms plentiful conducting channels to efficiently realize the injection of electrons into Cu and Ti sites. These Cu and Ti sites adsorb and activate the CO 2 and nitrophenyl ethane, respectively, cooperatively facilitating the l -Phe synthesis.

  abstract     = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with kidney diseases, but the causal variants, genes, and pathways involved remain elusive. Here, we identified a kidney disease gene called pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and proliferation factor (PPDPF) through integrating GWAS on kidney function and multiomic analysis. PPDPF was predominantly expressed in healthy proximal tubules of human and mouse kidneys via single-cell analysis. Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD + levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD + and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries. Consequently, knockout of PPDPF notably accelerated the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mouse models induced by aging, chemical exposure, and obstruction. These findings strongly support targeting PPDPF as a potential therapy for kidney fibrosis, offering possibilities for future CKD interventions.},

  abstract     = {The amplified wintertime Arctic warming has accelerated in recent decades. However, whether and how the warming can cause Eurasian cooling remains debated. By identifying daily Arctic warming events, we find direct observational evidence that the Arctic warming tends to cause substantial Eurasian cooling and an increase in occurrence frequency of Eurasian cooling events with a roughly 2-day lag. We propose a mechanism explaining the causality. We find that the Arctic warming causes a large suppression in activities of daily weather disturbances (referred to as synoptic eddies) over high-latitude Eurasia. This produces a meridional dipole in geopotential height anomalies characterized by an equivalent-barotropic anomalous low (high) and a lower-level cooling (warming) over mid-latitude Eurasia (the Arctic) via a nonlinear eddy–to–mean flow feedback. The feedback induces near-surface northeasterly anomalies that enlarge the Eurasian cooling via cold advection. Thus, we conclude that the warm Arctic versus cold Eurasia is essentially an intrinsic dipole determined by synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction.},

This process has traditionally been explained through the model of long-range Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this study, we demonstrate a donor-to-acceptor short-range energy transfer (SRET) mechanism in OPV blends with non-fullerene acceptors, extending beyond the Förster approximation. This SRET occurs as a two-step process mediated by interfacial excitations with mixed charge-transfer and local excitation features. We further validate this model through studies on planar heterojunctions, precisely controlling the thickness of interlayers. These findings underscore the short-range interactions in regulating the donor-to-acceptor energy transfer in OPV blends, suggesting that SRET should be considered alongside FRET and charge-transfer processes for device optimizations.},

Spd-2/CEP192 proteins, defined by a conserved “Spd-2 domain” (SP2D) comprising two closely spaced AspM-Spd-2-Hydin (ASH) domains, play a critical role in centrosome assembly. Here, we show that the SP2D does not target Drosophila Spd-2 to centrosomes but rather promotes PCM scaffold assembly. Crystal structures of the human and honeybee SP2D reveal an unusual “extended cradle” structure mediated by a conserved interaction interface between the two ASH domains. Mutations predicted to perturb this interface, including a human mutation associated with male infertility and Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy, disrupt PCM scaffold assembly in flies. The SP2D is monomeric in solution, but the Drosophila SP2D can form higher-order oligomers upon phosphorylation by PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1). Crystal-packing interactions and AlphaFold predictions suggest how SP2Ds might self-assemble, and mutations associated with one such potential dimerization interface markedly perturb SP2D oligomerization in vitro and PCM scaffold assembly in vivo.},

To examine this, we use rain and aerosol Hg speciation data and high-resolution surface DMHg measurements, collected on a transect from Alaskan coastal waters to the Bering and Chukchi Seas. We observed a significant fivefold increase in the MeHg:THg fraction in rain and a 10-fold increase for aerosols, closely linked to elevated surface DMHg and the highest DMHg evasion (~9.4 picomoles per square meter per hour) found in upwelling waters near the Aleutian Islands. These data highlight a previously underexplored aspect of MeHg air-sea exchange and its importance to Hg cycling and human health concerns. Our findings emphasize the importance of DMHg evasion by demonstrating that atmospheric MeHg can be transported long distances (~1700 kilometers) in the Arctic, posing risks to human health and ecosystems.},

However, the in vivo metabolic pathways of NMN and NR remain to be elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the fate of orally and intravenously administered NMN and NR in mice using NAD + metabolomics. We found that only a small portion of orally administered NMN and NR was directly absorbed from the small intestine and that most of them underwent gut microbiota–mediated deamidation and conversion to nicotinic acid (NA). Moreover, intravenously administered NMN and NR were rapidly degraded into nicotinamide and secreted to bile followed by deamidation to NA by gut microbiota. Thus, enterohepatic circulated NA is preferentially used in the liver. These findings showed that NMN and NR are indirectly converted to NAD + via unexpected metabolic pathways.},

Current models depict a global connection between mRNA synthesis and degradation, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that changes in RNA metabolism following depletion of TIP60/KAT5, the acetyltransferase subunit of the NuA4 transcriptional coactivator complex, reveal that transcript buffering occurs at a gene-specific level. By combining RNA sequencing of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and newly synthesized transcript fractions with biophysical modeling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that transcriptional changes caused by TIP60 depletion are offset by corresponding changes in RNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability, indicating gene-specific buffering. Disruption of the unrelated ATAC coactivator complex also causes gene-specific transcript buffering. We propose that cells dynamically adjust RNA splicing, export, and degradation in response to individual RNA synthesis alterations, thereby sustaining cellular homeostasis.},

Structure-activity relationship studies of an initial cadherin-binding peptide [ CBP ; apparent dissociation constant ( K d ) = 53 nanomolar] reveal residues responsible for driving affinity (hotspots) and mutation-tolerant residues (coldspots). Two original macrocyclic libraries are prepared in which these hotspots and coldspots are derivatized with nonnatural amino acids. Following discovery and validation, high-affinity ligands are discovered from the coldspot library, with NCBP-4 demonstrating improved affinity ( K d = 29 nanomolar).

Using compound-class radiocarbon analysis, molecular characterization, and bioassay experiments, we provide direct evidence for rapid microbial utilization of young, labile, high–molecular weight proteinaceous material in bathypelagic waters. The abundance of labile proteinaceous material diminishes from epipelagic to mesopelagic waters but notably increases in bathypelagic waters, where it exhibits a short turnover time (days) and resembles surface plankton in molecular composition. This observation coincides with peak zooplankton biomass recorded over the year. The nonmonotonic depth trend suggests a deep-sea replenishment of organic particles from mesopelagic migrating zooplankton.

Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 kelvin and dominates transport properties below 150 kelvin, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB 6 and YbB 12 . At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected.

  abstract     = {Whether the rapid warming of the Arctic, particularly the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS), substantially affects the Eurasian winter climate has been debated for over a decade. Here, we use an extended dynamical adjustment method to separate the effects of internal dynamics and thermodynamically forced BKS warming on atmospheric circulation, relying solely on observations. Evidence shows that the observed link between BKS warming and Eurasian cooling is influenced by both atmospheric internal variability and forced BKS warming. Internal variability, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly contributed to the observed Eurasian cooling from 1991 to 2012. While BKS warming has a weaker impact on Eurasian cooling on interannual to interdecadal timescales, it notably affects multidecadal scales, contributing to the observed “warming hole” in central Eurasia during 1980–2022. Our findings suggest a weak but non-negligible Eurasian cooling response to BKS warming on multidecadal timescales. These findings advance the understanding of the complex causal relationships between Arctic and mid-latitude climates.},

  abstract     = {Endoreplication is characterized by multiple rounds of DNA replication without cell division and determines the growth and final size of endoreplicating cells and tissues in eukaryotes. The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicating Drosophila salivary gland and Bombyx silk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr. Together, our study demonstrates that USP8 and Hsp70 regulate endoreplication by synergistically maintaining Fzr stability though deubiquitination.},

To explore their potential as detectors for ultrabroadband terahertz electromagnetic pulses, we measure the transient optical birefringence the terahertz field induces. Notably, the signal component linear in the FM magnetization agrees excellently with the shape of the incident terahertz electric field at 1 to 13 terahertz and beyond. Analysis indicates that the birefringence arises from the terahertz-field–driven spin accumulation at the FM/HM interface through the spin Rashba-Edelstein effect (SREE). Because of spin-momentum locking, the SREE decays by electron momentum relaxation in &lt;10 femtoseconds, substantially faster than a spin-Hall-effect–induced bulk spin accumulation. Our experiment demonstrates straightforward spintronic sampling of intense ultrabroadband terahertz fields with flat amplitude and phase response. Furthermore, it provides temporal signatures of the SREE and can be viewed as a versatile implementation of interface-specific terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.},

The β 2 -adrenergic receptor is an example of GPCR with high selectivity for Gαs, the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase, and much weaker for the Gαi family of G proteins inhibiting adenylyl cyclase. By developing a Gαi-biased agonist (LM189), we provide structural and biophysical evidence supporting that distinct conformations at ICL2 and TM6 are required for coupling of the different G protein subtypes Gαs and Gαi.

  abstract     = {Nicotine is an addictive substance that poses substantial health and societal challenges. Despite the known links between the medial habenula (MHb) and nicotine avoidance, the ionic mechanisms underlying MHb neuronal responses to nicotine remain unclear. Here, we report that MHb neurons use a long-lasting refractory period (LLRP) as an unconventional inhibitory mechanism to curb hyperexcitability. This process is initiated by nicotine-induced calcium influx through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which activates a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). Owing to high intracellular chloride levels in MHb neurons, chloride efflux through CaCC, coupled with high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels, sustains MHb depolarization near the chloride equilibrium potential of −30 millivolts, thereby enabling LLRP. Concurrently, calcium-activated BK potassium channels counteract this depolarization, promoting LLRP termination. Our findings reveal an atypical inhibitory mechanism, orchestrated by synergistic actions between calcium-permeable and calcium-activated channels. This discovery advances our understanding of neuronal excitability control and nicotine addiction.},

In this study, we characterized the function of y + LAT1-4F2hc complex in mammalian cells and determined the cryo-EM structures of the human y + LAT1-4F2hc complex in two distinct conformations: the apo state in an inward-open conformation and the native substrate-bound state in an outward-open conformation. Structural analysis suggests that Asp 243 in y + LAT1 plays a crucial role in coordination with sodium ion and substrate selectivity. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations further revealed the different transport mechanism of cationic amino acids and neutral amino acids. These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the substrate binding and working cycle of HATs.},

While these neural processes converge in the temporal cortex, the nature of their interactions remains largely unclear. Here, we systematically investigated the interplay between visual attention and stimulus feature coding by training macaques to perform a free-gaze visual search task with natural stimuli. Recording from a large number of units across multiple brain areas, we found that units exhibiting visual feature coding showed stronger attentional modulation of responses and spike–local field potential coherence than units without feature coding. Across brain areas, attention directed toward search targets enhanced the neuronal pattern separation of stimuli, with this enhancement more pronounced for units encoding visual features. Together, our results suggest a complex interplay between visual feature and attention coding in the primate brain, likely driven by interactions between brain areas engaged in these processes.},

We show that CD4 + CD57 + PD1 + T cells emerge in stable patients, conferring risks for ALAD, CLAD, and death. These cells are senescent, secrete inflammatory cytokines, and fall into two oligoclonal subsets with putative cytotoxic and follicular helper functions. Last, they are associated with fibrosis in mouse and human lung allografts, where they localize near airway epithelium and B cells.

Intriguingly, cell cycles of host and endosymbiont are synchronized. The molecular mechanisms underlying this notable level of integration are unknown. Previously, we identified a nucleus-encoded dynamin-like protein, called ETP9, that localizes at the endosymbiont division site of A. deanei . Here, we found by comparative genomics that endosymbionts throughout the Strigomonadinae lost the capacity to autonomously form a division septum. We describe the cell cycle–dependent subcellular localization of ETP9 that follows accumulation of the bacterium-encoded division protein FtsZ at the endosymbiont division site. Furthermore, we found that ETP9 is essential in symbiotic but dispensable in aposymbiotic A. deanei that lost the endosymbiont. In the symbiotic strain, ETP9 knockdowns resulted in filamentous, division-impaired endosymbionts. Our work unveiled that in A. deanei an endosymbiont division machinery of dual genetic origin evolved in which a neo-functionalized host protein compensates for losses of endosymbiont division genes.},

Using online measurement methods that impinge particles for OP quantification within seconds, we reveal that 60 to 99% of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and OP in secondary organic aerosol and combustion-generated PM have a lifetime of minutes to hours and that the ROS activity of ambient PM decays substantially before offline analysis. This implies that current offline measurement methods substantially underestimate the true OP of PM. We demonstrate that short-lived OP components activate different toxicity pathways upon direct deposition onto reconstituted human bronchial epithelia. Therefore, we suggest that future air pollution and health studies should include online OP quantification, allowing more accurate assessments of links between OP and health effects.},

This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler’s ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out-of-equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to d -dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path toward the study of competitive events in complex media.},

We propose that photoacoustic sensing in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window can enable deep tissue sensing as acoustic waves scatter less than light. To achieve this, we developed a photoacoustic polarization–enhanced optical rotation sensing (PAPEORS) system, capable of estimating optical rotation from photoacoustic signals and correlating it with chiral molecular concentration for depths up to 3.5 mm. Experiments were conducted using aqueous glucose solutions, naproxen, serum-based glucose samples, and ex vivo chicken tissue. PAPEORS achieved a detection limit of 80 mg/dl while using circularly polarized light with serum samples, demonstrating the potential for deep-tissue chiral molecular sensing. PAPEORS holds promise for in vivo sensing and easy miniaturization using single wavelength.},

However, the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Craniofacial integument displays dramatic diversity, exemplified by the Polish chicken (PC) with a homeotic transformation of comb-to-crest feathers, caused by a 195–base pair (bp) duplication in HoxC10 intron. Micro-C analyses show that HoxC-containing topologically associating domain (TAD) is normally closed in the scalp but open in the dorsal and tail regions, allowing multiple long-distance contacts. In the PC scalp, the TAD is open, resulting in high HoxC expression. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the 195-bp duplication reduces crest feather formation, and HoxC misexpression alters feather shapes. The 195-bp sequence is found only in Archelosauria (crocodilians and birds) and not in mammals.

  abstract     = {The constrained cross-talk between myeloid cells and T cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) restricts cancer immunotherapy efficacy, whereas the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2 −/− signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor. Our findings uncover Parkin’s involvement in suppressing macrophage antigen presentation for coordinating the cross-talk between macrophages and T cells.},

  abstract     = {The self-assembly of bacteriophage capsids from major capsid proteins (MCPs) and scaffolding proteins (SPs) and the subsequent expansion of these capsids are essential steps in bacteriophage life cycles. However, the mechanism by which assembly occurs remains poorly understood, and few intermediate states are available to illuminate the expansion of meta-stable procapsids into robust mature capsids. Here, we present the structure of a partially expanded phi29 procapsid that reveals distinct conformations of MCPs and allows visualization of SPs in multiple oligomeric states. These results suggest that formation of SP dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers drives dissociation of SP from MCP to actuate capsid expansion. Hexons expand first, and we propose penton maturation is delayed by a symmetry match with SP oligomers. We further show that the prolate shape of phi29’s capsid is possible due to concave hexons in the equatorial region of the capsid that may alter interactions with SP and explain the observed dependence of the prolate shape on SP.},

In addition, nMITO selectively targeted damaged endothelial cells via β-integrins and were delivered to injured tissues through tunneling nanotubes, enhancing their regulatory effects on inflammation and cell damage. In mouse models of acute myocardial injury, liver injury, and pancreatitis, nMITO notably reduced inflammatory responses and repaired tissue damage.

To identify druggable targets in cPIIRS, patient cerebral spinal fluid samples underwent transcriptional analysis, revealing a Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway dominance in neuroinflammatory gene signatures. MurinecPIIRS models recapitulated this pathway predominance and treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, confirmed a mechanistic requirement for this pathway in disease pathology. Ruxolitinib treatment improved markers of neuronal damage, reduced activated T cell and myeloid cells, and improved weight. On the basis of these findings, we conducted a first-in-human ruxolitinib treatment of patients with cPIIRS (NCT00001352). Ruxolitinib treatment of six patients led to demonstrated tolerability, reductions in inflammatory biomarkers and activated immune cells, and improved brain imaging. These results advocate for pathway-instructed therapeutics in neuroinflammatory diseases and endorse JAK inhibitors in further clinical studies of cPIIRS.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial cells often polarize along a tissue plane, a collective cell behavior known as planar cell polarity (PCP). To couple polarity between cells, asymmetrically localized PCP proteins bind intercellularly at cell junctions. Although PCP is by definition a multicellular process, the minimal number of cells required for PCP proteins to asymmetrically localize is not known. Basta et al . addressed this issue using chimeric mouse embryos in which dual-PCP reporter cells had been genetically uncoupled from their neighbors. They found that intercellular binding between just two cells was both necessary and sufficient to initiate the sorting of PCP complexes into asymmetric bridges. —Stella M. Hurtley For cells to polarize collectively along a tissue plane, asymmetrically localized planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes must form intercellular contacts between neighboring cells. Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.},

Long-term memory acquisition was found to be associated with a selective increase in multisynaptic boutons without the involvement of simultaneous activation of synaptically connected neurons. These results challenge the general applicability of the Hebbian model and expand our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for memory formation. —Mattia Maroso Memory engrams are formed through experience-dependent plasticity of neural circuits, but their detailed architectures remain unresolved. Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we performed nanoscale reconstructions of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway after chemogenetic labeling of cellular ensembles recruited during associative learning. Neurons with a remote history of activity coinciding with memory acquisition showed no strong preference for wiring with each other. Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes.

Two studies in this issue combine theory with existing data on multiple taxonomic groups to understand these relationships. Pigot et al . show that biomass generally increases with species richness because large-bodied species tend to be rare. Liang et al . show that ecosystem stability increases with area because of its relationship with biodiversity. Larger areas tend to have more species and more asynchrony between species, leading to greater stability. Together, these studies provide further insight into how biodiversity affects other ecosystem properties. —Bianca Lopez While both species richness and ecosystem stability increase with area, how these scaling patterns are linked remains unclear. Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.},

We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy.

Leveraging the strong atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrated fast qubit-state readout with 99.960 − 24 + 14 % fidelity and two methods for cavity-mediated entanglement generation with integrated error detection. First, we used cavity-carving to generate a Bell state with 91(4)% fidelity and a 32(1)% success rate (the number in parentheses is the standard deviation). Second, we performed a cavity-mediated gate with a deterministic entanglement fidelity of 52.5(18)%, increased to 76(2)% with error detection.

  abstract     = {The mitochondrial respiratory chain consists of membrane-integral complexes that build up the proton gradient across the membranes of the cristae, thereby powering ATP synthase. Waltz et al . used cryo–electron tomography to resolve native structures of these complexes directly within the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . Their findings reveal how respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a respirasome supercomplex, which is restricted to flat membrane regions apart from rows of ATP synthase at the curved tips of cristae. The work also captures fine structural details of how respirasomes are held together and how electron-carrier proteins bind these assemblies, offering insights into mitochondrial respiration inside native cells. —Stella M. Hurtley Mitochondria regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. This process is carried out by five membrane-bound complexes collectively known as the respiratory chain, working in concert to transfer electrons and pump protons. The precise organization of these complexes in native cells is debated. We used in situ cryo–electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes segregate into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively. Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a respirasome supercomplex, from which we determined a native 5-angstrom (Å) resolution structure showing binding of electron carrier cytochrome c . Combined with single-particle cryo–electron microscopy at 2.4-Å resolution, we model how the respiratory complexes organize inside native mitochondria.},

  abstract     = {Approximately 30% of the carbon emitted by human activity has been taken up on land, but exactly how and where that uptake has been achieved has been an open question. Bar-On et al . examined existing observational records of terrestrial carbon pools and found that live biomass has stored only a small fraction of that carbon, the bulk having been incorporated into nonliving organic matter (see the Perspective by Canadell). This work has important implications for understanding how quickly carbon is returned to the atmosphere. —Jesse Smith Terrestrial sequestration of carbon has mitigated ≈30% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, its distribution across different pools, live or dead biomass and soil and sedimentary organic carbon, remains uncertain. Analyzing global observational datasets of changes in terrestrial carbon pools, we found that ≈35 ± 14 gigatons of carbon (GtC) have been sequestered on land between 1992 and 2019, whereas live biomass changed by ≈1 ± 7 GtC. Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills.},

  abstract     = {As mountains form, they generate complex topography, heterogeneous environmental conditions, and barriers to movement that can separate populations. Marder et al . investigated whether this process contributes to the high biodiversity often found on mountains. Using simulations, they found that biodiversity increases with tectonic uplift and increasing topographic relief, not only on erosional mountain range highlands but also in adjacent depositional basins. Published long-term datasets on mammal species richness and lizard speciation show similar relationships between mountain building and diversity. —Bianca Lopez Biodiversity hotspots in Earth’s mountain ranges suggest a strong connection between topographic development and biological processes. However, it remains unclear whether high biodiversity in mountain ranges is an evolutionary response to the rate of relief generation during mountain building. Focusing on small mammals, such as rodents, we used coupled landscape-biological simulations to show that biodiversity increases with the magnitude and rate of tectonic uplift. This relationship, visible in depositional lowlands over millions of years, underscores the considerable role of mountain building in shaping past and present terrestrial biodiversity. Our results provide insights into the influence of topographic changes on evolutionary processes, offering a potential link between mountain formation and paleodiversity records.},

  abstract     = {Vascular plants regulate the flow of water and nutrients through their roots by creating a barrier in their extracellular space called the Casparian strip. Shen et al . identified genes involved in Casparian strip formation in Lotus japonicus , a legume that forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Furthermore, the authors established that mutants lacking a Casparian strip were less able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules, implying a connection between these processes. The presence of the Casparian strip also affected expression of the root-shoot signaling peptides that regulate nodulation. This work expands the role of the Casparian strip and links it to the spatial regulation of nodulation in plant roots. —Madeleine Seale Establishment of the apoplastic root barrier known as the Casparian strip occurs early in root development. In legumes, this area overlaps with nitrogen-fixing nodule formation, which raises the possibility that nodulation and barrier formation are connected. Nodules also contain Casparian strips, yet, in this case, their role is unknown. We established mutants with defective barriers in Lotus japonicus . This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation. Our findings further revealed that in nodules, the genetic machinery for Casparian strip formation is shared with roots. Apoplastic blockage controls the metabolic source-sink status required for nitrogen fixation. This identifies Casparian strips as a model system to study spatially constrained symbiotic plant-microbe relationships.},

As such, they are especially susceptible to low blood oxygen levels, which could lead to drowning while submerged. McKnight et al . exposed diving gray seals to various gas mixes and found that the seals responded to low levels of blood oxygen but not high levels of carbon dioxide (see the Perspective by Hawkes and Kendall-Bar). Nearly all other mammals are insensitive to blood oxygen levels, instead gauging blood oxygen by sensing increasing carbon dioxide. Direct sensing of oxygen levels likely improves diving efficiency. —Sacha Vignieri Marine mammals rely on maintaining sufficient blood oxygen levels while diving to prevent drowning. Generally, oxygen is cognitively imperceptible to mammals that instead sense rising carbon dioxide as a proxy for low oxygen. Not perceiving oxygen, however, is risky for diving mammals. We argue that any ability to alter dives based upon direct perception of oxygen should have been strongly selected for. We exposed diving seals to inhaled gas mixes that were experimentally altered to affect circulating levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Dive duration was positively correlated with circulating oxygen levels but unaffected by carbon dioxide levels and pH. These results suggest that seals do cognitively perceive circulating oxygen and use this to alter dive behavior.},

  abstract     = {The number of species in an ecosystem relates to several other key properties, including biomass and stability across time. Two studies in this issue combine theory with existing data on multiple taxonomic groups to understand these relationships. Pigot et al . show that biomass generally increases with species richness because large-bodied species tend to be rare. Liang et al . show that ecosystem stability increases with area because of its relationship with biodiversity. Larger areas tend to have more species and more asynchrony between species, leading to greater stability. Together, these studies provide further insight into how biodiversity affects other ecosystem properties. —Bianca Lopez Despite advances in theory and experiments, how biodiversity influences the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems remains debated. By applying new theory to data on 84,695 plant, animal, and protist assemblages, we show that the general positive effect of species richness on stocks of biomass, as well as much of the variation in the strength and sign of this effect, is predicted by a fundamental macroecological quantity: the scaling of species abundance with body mass. Standing biomass increases with richness when large-bodied species are numerically rare but is independent of richness when species size and abundance are uncoupled. These results suggest a new fundamental law in the structure of ecological communities and show that the impacts of changes in species richness on biomass are predictable.},

  abstract     = {Humans typically cannot remember events occurring during the first 3 years of life. This phenomenon, given the name infantile amnesia by Sigmund Freud, has intrigued scientists for more than a century ( 1 ). Do people not remember experiences from infancy because the brain is too immature to form memories, or are these memories formed and then forgotten? This seemingly simple question has been difficult to answer given the technical challenges of studying the infant brain. On page 1316 of this issue, Yates et al . ( 2 ) provide functional neuroimaging evidence that the infant hippocampus (a brain region important for memory) can encode the types of information that are required for episodic memory, that is, memories for specific life events containing information about people, places, and things. This suggests that immaturity of postencoding processes, such as memory consolidation or retrieval, is a more likely explanation for infantile amnesia.},

These carbon sinks, along with the oceans, slow the buildup of atmospheric CO 2 and the pace of global warming. The locations where the absorbed emissions are stored govern the long-term stability and management of carbon pools—those places in Earth’s biosphere that can accumulate, store, and release carbon. Nonetheless, how carbon is dispersed across different pools on land remains unclear. On page 1291 of this issue, Bar-On et al. ( 1 ) report an unexpectedly large distribution of terrestrial carbon in pools of nonliving organic matter that are natural or human made. Carbon sequestration beyond the more vulnerable components, such as trees, could imply greater carbon stability on land than previously thought. This finding highlights the growing complexity of the future evolution and management of carbon sinks and reservoirs.},

For biohybrid robotic swimmers assembled with tissue engineering, this is problematic because most devices operate at different length scales than their naturally occurring counterparts, resulting in reduced performance. To overcome these challenges, here, we demonstrate how machine learning–directed optimization (ML-DO) can be used to inform the design of a biohybrid robot, outperforming other nonlinear optimization techniques, such as Bayesian optimization, in the selection of high-performance geometries. We show how this approach can be used to maximize the thrust generated by a tissue-engineered mobuliform miniray. This results in devices that can swim at the millimeter scale while more closely preserving natural locomotive scaling laws. Overall, this work provides a quantitatively rigorous approach for the engineering design of muscular structure-function relationships in an automated fashion.},

The MuMuTA can provide linear actuation with high contractile force (~8 millinewtons) and high contractile length (~4 millimeters), which can be converted into the flexion of multijointed fingers by a cable-driven mechanism. We successfully powered the biohybrid hand achieving individual control of fingers and a variety of motions using different signaling controls.

We report a fast (5.1 centimeters per second translation and 195 degrees per second rotation), centimeter-scale swimming robot with high maneuverability and autonomous untethered operation. Locomotion is enabled by a pair of soft, millimeter-thin, undulating pectoral fins, in which traveling waves are electrically excited to generate propulsion. The actuators, robot design, and power supply are codesigned to enable high-performance locomotion in a scaled-down system. A single soft electrohydraulic actuator per side generates the traveling wave. A compact and lightweight power supply enables untethered operation, made possible by decreasing the operating voltage of the electrohydraulic actuators to below 500 volts and their power consumption to 35 milliwatts. By an experimental study and by modeling, we determined optimum dimensions and operating conditions across designs and size scales. The robots navigate through narrow spaces and through grassy plants and push objects weighing more than 16 times their body weight. Such robots can allow exploration of complex environments as well as continuous measurement of plant and water parameters for aquafarming.},

Facilitated by fast physical reasoning, humans are able to rapidly alter their compliance, enhancing robustness and safety in active environments. Transferring these capabilities to robotics is of utmost importance particularly as major space agencies begin investigating the potential of cooperative robotic teams in space. In this scenario, robots in orbit or on planetary surfaces are meant to support astronauts in exploration, maintenance, and habitat building to reduce costs and risks of space missions. A major challenge for interactive robot teams is establishing the capability to act in and interact with dynamic environments. Analogous to humans, the robot should be not only particularly compliant in case of unexpected collisions with other systems but also able to cooperatively handle objects requiring accurate pose estimation and fast trajectory planning. Here, we show that these challenges can be attenuated through an enhancement of active robot compliance introducing a virtual plastic first-order impedance component. We present how elasto-plastic compliance can be realized via energy-based detection of active environments and how evasive motions can be enabled through adaptive plastic compliance. Two space teleoperation experiments using different robotic assets confirm the potential of the method to enhance robustness in interaction with articulated objects and facilitate robot cooperation. An experiment in a health care facility presents how the same method analogously solidifies robotic interactions in human-robot shared environments by giving the robot a subordinate role.},

  abstract     = {Although legged robots have demonstrated effective mobility in some natural settings, as robot size decreases, obstacles in their environment become challenging to overcome. Small arthropods scale obstacles many times their size through jumps powered by mechanisms that overcome speed and power limitations of muscle alone. The motivation for this study was to explore the marriage of impulsive (jumping) and nonimpulsive (cyclic legged ambulation) behaviors in a centimeter-scale robot. Here, jumping is achieved by striking the ground with a bioinspired appendage connected to a parallel linkage. As the linkage configuration passes through the singularity, a torque reversal occurs whereby elastic energy slowly stored by force-dense velocity-limited shape memory alloy actuators is rapidly released. A passively driven elastic hinge is introduced in the striking arm to mediate ground contact forces and direct jumping. High-speed video recording of the 14-millisecond launch phase reveals previously undocumented takeoff dynamics closely resembling those of springtails. A dynamic model was derived, and an experimentally validated simulation was used to optimize the design of key components. The 2.2-gram, 6.1-centimeter-long mechanism achieved a maximum horizontal jumping distance of 1.4 meters (23 body lengths), surpassing that of similarly sized insects. The mechanism was integrated with an agile quadrupedal microrobot with leg articulation suitable to achieve the ideal jumping posture. The platform demonstrated repeatable directional takeoffs and upright landings, enabling complex maneuvers to overcome obstacles and gaps. Last, we used this bioinspired robot to offer reflection on hypotheses related to springtail jumping behavior.},

Excessive or insufficient indentation of the injection cannula into the retina or motion of the cannula with respect to the retina can result in retinal trauma or incorrect placement of the therapeutic product. Robotic assistance can potentially enable the surgeon to more precisely position the injection cannula and maintain its position for a prolonged period of time. However, head motion is common among patients undergoing eye surgery, complicating subretinal injections, yet it is often not considered in the evaluation of robotic assistance. No prior study has both included head motion during an evaluation of robotic assistance and demonstrated a significant improvement in the ability to perform subretinal injections compared with the manual approach. In a hybrid ex vivo and in situ study in which an enucleated eye was mounted on a human volunteer, we demonstrate that head-mounting a high-precision teleoperated surgical robot to passively reduce undesirable relative motion between the robot and the eye results in a bleb-formation success rate on moving eyes that is significantly higher than the manual success rates reported in the literature even on stationary enucleated eyes.},

  abstract     = {Robotic locomotion has shown substantial advancements, yet robots still lack the versatility and agility shown by animals navigating complex terrains. This limits their applicability in complex environments where they could be highly beneficial. Unlike existing robots that rely on intricate perception systems to construct models of both themselves and their surroundings, a more bioinspired approach leverages reconfiguration to adapt a robot’s morphology to its environment. Although interest in such multimodal, terrain-adaptive robots is increasing, their capacity for morphological reconfiguration often remains confined to specific body parts or comes at the expense of increased system complexity and reduced locomotion efficiency. Our study seeks to enhance robotic locomotion by developing robots that can actively reconfigure their morphology, altering their physical properties and leveraging their adaptability to navigate efficiently in diverse environments. We demonstrate how combining a compliant structure with morphological reconfiguration allowed a robot to transition between flat and spherical forms, enabling autonomous, multimodal locomotion—driving, rolling, and swimming—across complex terrains with minimal sensing. By actively reconfiguring its morphology to adapt physical properties for compliant interactions, the robot enhanced locomotion across rough, diverse environments. Leveraging its adaptability in different locomotion modes to navigate a 4.5-kilometer path across mountainous, aquatic, and urban terrains, the robot outperformed traditional and multimodal robots in terms of versatility, energy efficiency, and robustness. Developing versatile, energy-efficient, compliant robots capable of reconfiguring their morphology could substantially enhance autonomous navigation, opening up broader applications in unstructured environments, from environmental monitoring to disaster response and extraterrestrial exploration.},

  abstract     = {Because the STAT family of transcriptional regulators induces the expression of genes involved in antiviral signaling, they are often targeted by viruses to suppress immune responses. Activation of STATs by tyrosine phosphorylation induces their dimerization, and STAT dimers can assemble into tetramers with different transcriptional properties. Sugiyama et al . solved the cryo-EM structure of a tetrameric form of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 in complex with DNA, showing how interactions between N-terminal domains of the protein supported the dimerization of STAT1 dimers. Biochemical analyses and modeling further indicated how the rabies virus P-protein specifically targets STAT1 tetramers, suggesting a potential mechanism of immune evasion. —John F. Foley Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members mediate signaling in the Janus kinase (JAK)–STAT pathway and are activated by phosphorylation at a conserved tyrosine residue, resulting in dimerization through reciprocal interactions between the phosphotyrosine and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT (pY-STAT) then translocates to the nucleus to induce the expression of genes encoding antiviral proteins. Although the active and functional forms of STATs are conventionally considered to be dimers, STATs can undergo higher-order oligomerization, which is implicated in regulating transcriptional activity. We present the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the tetrameric form of intact pY-STAT1 in complex with DNA, which indicates that interactions between the amino-terminal domains (NTDs) of STAT1 induce oligomerization. The tetrameric structure revealed a compact conformation with a previously uncharacterized binding interface: Two DNA-bound dimers are twofold symmetrically aligned to transform into a tandem DNA-binding model without NTD dimer separation. Moreover, biochemical analyses indicated that the rabies virus P-protein selectively targeted tetrameric pY-STAT1. Combined with data showing which regions contribute to the interaction between pY-STAT1 and the P-protein, we constructed a binding model explaining how P recognizes the pY-STAT1 tetramer. These data provide insight into how pathogenic viruses target signaling pathways that mediate the host immune response.},

  abstract     = {In prostate cancers, the abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4 is inversely correlated with response to the antiandrogen (also known as an androgen receptor inhibitor) enzalutamide. Zhang et al. found that PDCD4 is repressed by the mitotic kinase PLK1, which enabled the activity of cell survival pathways that are androgen independent. In prostate cancer cell lines, PLK1 promoted the degradation of PDCD4, which released a brake on c-MYC, stimulating its activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and metabolic pathways that reduced cellular dependence on androgen receptor signaling and thus reduced sensitivity to enzalutamide. Treatment with the Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib restored enzalutamide sensitivity in tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that this may be an effective strategy in patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Enzalutamide, a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor (also known as an antiandrogen), is used to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Tumors often acquire resistance to enzalutamide. Tumor progression and enzalutamide resistance are associated with decreased abundance of the tumor suppressor PDCD4. In normal dividing cells, PDCD4 abundance is low when that of the kinase PLK1 is high. In this study, we found that PLK1 acted on PDCD4 to promote enzalutamide resistance in CRPC cells in culture and in mice via a mechanism that revealed an effective combination therapy. PLK1 phosphorylated PDCD4 at Ser 239 , leading to its degradation and consequently inducing the transcriptional activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by c-MYC. Hh signaling supports tumor cell proliferation and stemness by inducing the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15), which promotes the metabolic clearance of drugs and steroid hormones. Thus, this pathway may circumvent androgen receptor dependence, thereby reducing cellular sensitivity to enzalutamide. Knocking down UGT2B15 enhanced enzalutamide-induced cell apoptosis and growth arrest in a PDCD4-dependent manner. Combining enzalutamide with the clinically approved Hh pathway inhibitor vismodegib inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in enzalutamide-resistant cell cultures and xenografts in vivo. Our findings reveal a mechanism of PLK1-mediated enzalutamide resistance and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance in prostate cancer.},
