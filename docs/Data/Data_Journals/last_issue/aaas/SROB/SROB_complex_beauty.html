For biohybrid robotic swimmers assembled with tissue engineering, this is problematic because most devices operate at different length scales than their naturally occurring counterparts, resulting in reduced performance. To overcome these challenges, here, we demonstrate how machine learning–directed optimization (ML-DO) can be used to inform the design of a biohybrid robot, outperforming other nonlinear optimization techniques, such as Bayesian optimization, in the selection of high-performance geometries. We show how this approach can be used to maximize the thrust generated by a tissue-engineered mobuliform miniray. This results in devices that can swim at the millimeter scale while more closely preserving natural locomotive scaling laws. Overall, this work provides a quantitatively rigorous approach for the engineering design of muscular structure-function relationships in an automated fashion.},

However, current designs typically only drive simple substrates on a small scale, limiting flexibility and controllability. To address this, we proposed a biohybrid hand with multijointed fingers powered by multiple muscle tissue actuators (MuMuTAs), bundles of thin muscle tissues. The MuMuTA can provide linear actuation with high contractile force (~8 millinewtons) and high contractile length (~4 millimeters), which can be converted into the flexion of multijointed fingers by a cable-driven mechanism. We successfully powered the biohybrid hand achieving individual control of fingers and a variety of motions using different signaling controls. This study showcases the potential of MuMuTAs as a driving source for advanced biohybrid robotics.},

Such environments are often highly unstructured and cluttered with plant matter, animals, and debris, which require robots to move swiftly. We report a fast (5.1 centimeters per second translation and 195 degrees per second rotation), centimeter-scale swimming robot with high maneuverability and autonomous untethered operation. Locomotion is enabled by a pair of soft, millimeter-thin, undulating pectoral fins, in which traveling waves are electrically excited to generate propulsion. The actuators, robot design, and power supply are codesigned to enable high-performance locomotion in a scaled-down system. A single soft electrohydraulic actuator per side generates the traveling wave. A compact and lightweight power supply enables untethered operation, made possible by decreasing the operating voltage of the electrohydraulic actuators to below 500 volts and their power consumption to 35 milliwatts. By an experimental study and by modeling, we determined optimum dimensions and operating conditions across designs and size scales. The robots navigate through narrow spaces and through grassy plants and push objects weighing more than 16 times their body weight. Such robots can allow exploration of complex environments as well as continuous measurement of plant and water parameters for aquafarming.},

  abstract     = {Humans exhibit a particular compliant behavior in interactions with their environment. Facilitated by fast physical reasoning, humans are able to rapidly alter their compliance, enhancing robustness and safety in active environments. Transferring these capabilities to robotics is of utmost importance particularly as major space agencies begin investigating the potential of cooperative robotic teams in space. In this scenario, robots in orbit or on planetary surfaces are meant to support astronauts in exploration, maintenance, and habitat building to reduce costs and risks of space missions. A major challenge for interactive robot teams is establishing the capability to act in and interact with dynamic environments. Analogous to humans, the robot should be not only particularly compliant in case of unexpected collisions with other systems but also able to cooperatively handle objects requiring accurate pose estimation and fast trajectory planning. Here, we show that these challenges can be attenuated through an enhancement of active robot compliance introducing a virtual plastic first-order impedance component. We present how elasto-plastic compliance can be realized via energy-based detection of active environments and how evasive motions can be enabled through adaptive plastic compliance. Two space teleoperation experiments using different robotic assets confirm the potential of the method to enhance robustness in interaction with articulated objects and facilitate robot cooperation. An experiment in a health care facility presents how the same method analogously solidifies robotic interactions in human-robot shared environments by giving the robot a subordinate role.},

  abstract     = {Although legged robots have demonstrated effective mobility in some natural settings, as robot size decreases, obstacles in their environment become challenging to overcome. Small arthropods scale obstacles many times their size through jumps powered by mechanisms that overcome speed and power limitations of muscle alone. The motivation for this study was to explore the marriage of impulsive (jumping) and nonimpulsive (cyclic legged ambulation) behaviors in a centimeter-scale robot. Here, jumping is achieved by striking the ground with a bioinspired appendage connected to a parallel linkage. As the linkage configuration passes through the singularity, a torque reversal occurs whereby elastic energy slowly stored by force-dense velocity-limited shape memory alloy actuators is rapidly released. A passively driven elastic hinge is introduced in the striking arm to mediate ground contact forces and direct jumping. High-speed video recording of the 14-millisecond launch phase reveals previously undocumented takeoff dynamics closely resembling those of springtails. A dynamic model was derived, and an experimentally validated simulation was used to optimize the design of key components. The 2.2-gram, 6.1-centimeter-long mechanism achieved a maximum horizontal jumping distance of 1.4 meters (23 body lengths), surpassing that of similarly sized insects. The mechanism was integrated with an agile quadrupedal microrobot with leg articulation suitable to achieve the ideal jumping posture. The platform demonstrated repeatable directional takeoffs and upright landings, enabling complex maneuvers to overcome obstacles and gaps. Last, we used this bioinspired robot to offer reflection on hypotheses related to springtail jumping behavior.},

  abstract     = {Therapeutic protocols involving subretinal injection, which hold the promise of saving or restoring sight, are challenging for surgeons because they are at the limits of human motor and perceptual abilities. Excessive or insufficient indentation of the injection cannula into the retina or motion of the cannula with respect to the retina can result in retinal trauma or incorrect placement of the therapeutic product. Robotic assistance can potentially enable the surgeon to more precisely position the injection cannula and maintain its position for a prolonged period of time. However, head motion is common among patients undergoing eye surgery, complicating subretinal injections, yet it is often not considered in the evaluation of robotic assistance. No prior study has both included head motion during an evaluation of robotic assistance and demonstrated a significant improvement in the ability to perform subretinal injections compared with the manual approach. In a hybrid ex vivo and in situ study in which an enucleated eye was mounted on a human volunteer, we demonstrate that head-mounting a high-precision teleoperated surgical robot to passively reduce undesirable relative motion between the robot and the eye results in a bleb-formation success rate on moving eyes that is significantly higher than the manual success rates reported in the literature even on stationary enucleated eyes.},

  abstract     = {Robotic locomotion has shown substantial advancements, yet robots still lack the versatility and agility shown by animals navigating complex terrains. This limits their applicability in complex environments where they could be highly beneficial. Unlike existing robots that rely on intricate perception systems to construct models of both themselves and their surroundings, a more bioinspired approach leverages reconfiguration to adapt a robot’s morphology to its environment. Although interest in such multimodal, terrain-adaptive robots is increasing, their capacity for morphological reconfiguration often remains confined to specific body parts or comes at the expense of increased system complexity and reduced locomotion efficiency. Our study seeks to enhance robotic locomotion by developing robots that can actively reconfigure their morphology, altering their physical properties and leveraging their adaptability to navigate efficiently in diverse environments. We demonstrate how combining a compliant structure with morphological reconfiguration allowed a robot to transition between flat and spherical forms, enabling autonomous, multimodal locomotion—driving, rolling, and swimming—across complex terrains with minimal sensing. By actively reconfiguring its morphology to adapt physical properties for compliant interactions, the robot enhanced locomotion across rough, diverse environments. Leveraging its adaptability in different locomotion modes to navigate a 4.5-kilometer path across mountainous, aquatic, and urban terrains, the robot outperformed traditional and multimodal robots in terms of versatility, energy efficiency, and robustness. Developing versatile, energy-efficient, compliant robots capable of reconfiguring their morphology could substantially enhance autonomous navigation, opening up broader applications in unstructured environments, from environmental monitoring to disaster response and extraterrestrial exploration.},
