  abstract     = {Epithelial cells often polarize along a tissue plane, a collective cell behavior known as planar cell polarity (PCP). To couple polarity between cells, asymmetrically localized PCP proteins bind intercellularly at cell junctions. Although PCP is by definition a multicellular process, the minimal number of cells required for PCP proteins to asymmetrically localize is not known. Basta et al . addressed this issue using chimeric mouse embryos in which dual-PCP reporter cells had been genetically uncoupled from their neighbors. They found that intercellular binding between just two cells was both necessary and sufficient to initiate the sorting of PCP complexes into asymmetric bridges. —Stella M. Hurtley For cells to polarize collectively along a tissue plane, asymmetrically localized planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes must form intercellular contacts between neighboring cells. Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.},

Uytiepo et al . used three-dimensional electron microscopy coupled with chemogenetic tagging and behavioral analysis to determine the structural changes supporting the acquisition of long-term fear memories, focusing on the Schaffer collateral synapses. Long-term memory acquisition was found to be associated with a selective increase in multisynaptic boutons without the involvement of simultaneous activation of synaptically connected neurons. These results challenge the general applicability of the Hebbian model and expand our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for memory formation. —Mattia Maroso Memory engrams are formed through experience-dependent plasticity of neural circuits, but their detailed architectures remain unresolved. Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we performed nanoscale reconstructions of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway after chemogenetic labeling of cellular ensembles recruited during associative learning. Neurons with a remote history of activity coinciding with memory acquisition showed no strong preference for wiring with each other. Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes. Our findings elucidate the physical hallmarks of long-term memory and offer a structural basis for the cellular flexibility of information coding.},

Two studies in this issue combine theory with existing data on multiple taxonomic groups to understand these relationships. Pigot et al . show that biomass generally increases with species richness because large-bodied species tend to be rare. Liang et al . show that ecosystem stability increases with area because of its relationship with biodiversity. Larger areas tend to have more species and more asynchrony between species, leading to greater stability. Together, these studies provide further insight into how biodiversity affects other ecosystem properties. —Bianca Lopez While both species richness and ecosystem stability increase with area, how these scaling patterns are linked remains unclear. Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.},

They found that infants are capable of encoding memories during infancy, and deficits in postencoding retrieval mechanisms are likely responsible for infantile amnesia in humans. —Mattia Maroso Humans lack memories for specific events from the first few years of life. We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia.},

In this work, we report on the direct growth of close-packed SWNT arrays on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, demonstrating high alignment and uniform chirality within each array.

Leveraging the strong atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrated fast qubit-state readout with 99.960 − 24 + 14 % fidelity and two methods for cavity-mediated entanglement generation with integrated error detection. First, we used cavity-carving to generate a Bell state with 91(4)% fidelity and a 32(1)% success rate (the number in parentheses is the standard deviation). Second, we performed a cavity-mediated gate with a deterministic entanglement fidelity of 52.5(18)%, increased to 76(2)% with error detection.

This work has important implications for understanding how quickly carbon is returned to the atmosphere. —Jesse Smith Terrestrial sequestration of carbon has mitigated ≈30% of anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, its distribution across different pools, live or dead biomass and soil and sedimentary organic carbon, remains uncertain. Analyzing global observational datasets of changes in terrestrial carbon pools, we found that ≈35 ± 14 gigatons of carbon (GtC) have been sequestered on land between 1992 and 2019, whereas live biomass changed by ≈1 ± 7 GtC. Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills.},

Furthermore, the authors established that mutants lacking a Casparian strip were less able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules, implying a connection between these processes. The presence of the Casparian strip also affected expression of the root-shoot signaling peptides that regulate nodulation. This work expands the role of the Casparian strip and links it to the spatial regulation of nodulation in plant roots. —Madeleine Seale Establishment of the apoplastic root barrier known as the Casparian strip occurs early in root development. In legumes, this area overlaps with nitrogen-fixing nodule formation, which raises the possibility that nodulation and barrier formation are connected. Nodules also contain Casparian strips, yet, in this case, their role is unknown. We established mutants with defective barriers in Lotus japonicus . This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation. Our findings further revealed that in nodules, the genetic machinery for Casparian strip formation is shared with roots.

  abstract     = {Marine mammals have adapted to an underwater environment and spend long periods of time underwater foraging despite the need for breathing air. As such, they are especially susceptible to low blood oxygen levels, which could lead to drowning while submerged. McKnight et al . exposed diving gray seals to various gas mixes and found that the seals responded to low levels of blood oxygen but not high levels of carbon dioxide (see the Perspective by Hawkes and Kendall-Bar). Nearly all other mammals are insensitive to blood oxygen levels, instead gauging blood oxygen by sensing increasing carbon dioxide. Direct sensing of oxygen levels likely improves diving efficiency. —Sacha Vignieri Marine mammals rely on maintaining sufficient blood oxygen levels while diving to prevent drowning. Generally, oxygen is cognitively imperceptible to mammals that instead sense rising carbon dioxide as a proxy for low oxygen. Not perceiving oxygen, however, is risky for diving mammals. We argue that any ability to alter dives based upon direct perception of oxygen should have been strongly selected for. We exposed diving seals to inhaled gas mixes that were experimentally altered to affect circulating levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Dive duration was positively correlated with circulating oxygen levels but unaffected by carbon dioxide levels and pH. These results suggest that seals do cognitively perceive circulating oxygen and use this to alter dive behavior.},

  abstract     = {The number of species in an ecosystem relates to several other key properties, including biomass and stability across time. Two studies in this issue combine theory with existing data on multiple taxonomic groups to understand these relationships. Pigot et al . show that biomass generally increases with species richness because large-bodied species tend to be rare. Liang et al . show that ecosystem stability increases with area because of its relationship with biodiversity. Larger areas tend to have more species and more asynchrony between species, leading to greater stability. Together, these studies provide further insight into how biodiversity affects other ecosystem properties. —Bianca Lopez Despite advances in theory and experiments, how biodiversity influences the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems remains debated. By applying new theory to data on 84,695 plant, animal, and protist assemblages, we show that the general positive effect of species richness on stocks of biomass, as well as much of the variation in the strength and sign of this effect, is predicted by a fundamental macroecological quantity: the scaling of species abundance with body mass. Standing biomass increases with richness when large-bodied species are numerically rare but is independent of richness when species size and abundance are uncoupled. These results suggest a new fundamental law in the structure of ecological communities and show that the impacts of changes in species richness on biomass are predictable.},

To implement the plan, Poland has cut down hundreds of thousands of trees along 170 km of the Bug River, the last large unregulated river in Eastern Europe (2, 3), along Poland’s border with Belarus. To compensate for the ecosystem and biodiversity destruction, Polish authorities should restore the oxbow lakes within Polish borders and continuously monitor riverbank erosion. In the future, if there is a need to improve the riverbanks, Poland should strengthen them sustainably by using only wooden materials.},

Key to the power of quantum computing is the ability to entangle two or more qubits (quantum bits) into joint states that cannot be described by the properties of individual particles alone. Entanglement between neutral-atom qubits has been achieved between atoms close to each other, typically through electromagnetic fields in free space—as opposed to confined to a restricted region of space within a device, such as a cavity between mirrors ( 1 ). On page 1301 of this issue, Grinkemeyer et al . ( 2 ) report that quantum gates that entangle qubits separated by a small optical cavity can perform operations quickly and accurately. The system includes a fiber-optic cable that transmits information over long distances, representing an essential step toward building reliable and large-scale quantum computing networks.},

This phenomenon, given the name infantile amnesia by Sigmund Freud, has intrigued scientists for more than a century ( 1 ). Do people not remember experiences from infancy because the brain is too immature to form memories, or are these memories formed and then forgotten? This seemingly simple question has been difficult to answer given the technical challenges of studying the infant brain. On page 1316 of this issue, Yates et al . ( 2 ) provide functional neuroimaging evidence that the infant hippocampus (a brain region important for memory) can encode the types of information that are required for episodic memory, that is, memories for specific life events containing information about people, places, and things. This suggests that immaturity of postencoding processes, such as memory consolidation or retrieval, is a more likely explanation for infantile amnesia.},
