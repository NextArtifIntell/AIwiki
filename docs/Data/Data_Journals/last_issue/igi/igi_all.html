  abstract     = {Abstract Face super-resolution generates high-resolution face images from low-resolution inputs, supporting face recognition in challenging environments. While deep learning methods, like Stable Diffusion and origin Transformer-based framework, have advanced super-resolution, they require heavy computation, making them difficult for tasks like face recognition. However, recognition accuracy only needs images of size 112x112, reducing the necessity for extremely large outputs. Existing methods often rely on convolutional attention, limiting receptive fields and performance. To address this, we propose SETFSR, a Semantically Guided Efficient Attention Transformer Face Super-Resolution. Our model leverages efficient self-attention for global feature extraction and incorporates face parsing constraints for structural accuracy. Experiments on Helen, CelebA, and FFHQ datasets show that SETFSR outperforms state-of-the-art models in PSNR, SSIM, and identity preservation.},

This study focuses on a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator, developing a mechanical dynamics model and implementing a parallel Linear Active Disturbance Rejection Controller (LADRC) for joint control. To enhance robustness and responsiveness, a hybrid adaptive control method is introduced, integrating adaptive laws (AL) for online tuning of parameters and offline optimization using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. This improves tracking control efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, offline reinforcement learning refines parameters without adding real-time computational demands. Finally, semantic web principles ensure interpretability and transparency of the control flow. Compared to traditional LADRC, the proposed method shows superior anti-interference capabilities and dynamic performance.},

A GSR model for the identification of suboptimal operating conditions of yield and quality based on random forest classification was established. The experimental results demonstrate that the method is capable of rapidly and accurately identifying the production and quality of the calcining kiln. The identification accuracy of the yield and quality of the suboptimal operating conditions is 99.82% and 99.18% respectively.

  abstract     = {Abstract A brain tumor is one of the most prevalent causes of cancer death. The best strategy is the timely treatment of brain tumors in their early detection. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a standard non-invasive method to detect brain tumors. For early detection and better patient survival through MRI scans, the diagnosis needs a high level of knowledge in the radiological and neurological domains to identify the cancers. Researchers have suggested various brain cancer detection techniques. However, most existing automatic cancer detection approaches suffer from poor accuracy and low detection rates. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) using deep feature extraction and adaptive Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask-RCNNs) model for brain tumor detection and classification method to overcome these issues. The experimental findings on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that the planned model is highly effective, with 99.64% accuracy, 95.93% precision, 95.39% recall, and 95.67% F1-score.},

This paper introduces a super node-based trust management model designed to enhance semantic networks by linking nodes through trust relationships. The model exploits the synergistic incentives of similar interest behaviours to achieve a steady construction of trust relationships. We propose a similarity filtering algorithm that calculates the similarity to filter out false, misleading, or unfair information effectively. Through simulations, we compare our model with RRGRET, Surework, and community-based approaches, and the results show that our model has good network properties, while also resisting multiple malicious attacks and guaranteeing collaboration success.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel ghosting-free image fusion method using a dual gain video stream setup on an FPGA. IMX662 image sensor is employed, which simultaneously captures both HCG and LCG images with the same exposure time, enabling efficient HDR image synthesis. The proposed method directly addresses the source of the problem, eliminating the need for post-processing steps, thereby preserving algorithmic simplicity. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method not only removes ghosting by 100% but also processes data on an FPGA 98.79% faster than traditional software-based HDR fusion techniques, enabling real-time video stream processing. This dual gain, ghosting-free fusion algorithm demonstrates promising potential for use in high-speed photography and surveillance.},

When many consumers need to rent a car, they hope to use it conveniently and quickly. They also need to book parking spaces along the way and have corresponding insurance services. However, there is a lack of effective integration between the existing car rental system and reserved parking spaces. As a result, users often need to spend extra time and energy looking for parking spaces when using car rental services, and the insurance policies generated by temporary insurance services are difficult to cover at the same time. To address these issues, this study proposed an integrated car rental service platform based on blockchain technology and the Interplanetary File System. This platform consolidates transaction information among various stakeholders in the car rental service. It also preserves the consumer&#39;s complete rental order information and status, uses the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman to privately generate a shared key.},

Current systems typically rely on local data, making it difficult to handle cross-institutional data or complex fraudulent activities. To address this issue, we propose a financial risk control model based on the Federated Semantic Web (FSW). This model deploys a federated learning framework between banks, allowing data to be stored independently, thus ensuring privacy protection. The model automatically selects and scores risk features from transaction data using a multi-perspective topological graph, and assigns the final risk labels via a weighted voting mechanism. The central model updates and redistributes the global model based on parameters shared by local models through the federated averaging algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively identifies fraudulent transactions and predicts credit risk, meets security standards, and improves accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract In multi-UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC), insufficient consideration of collaborative computation in inter-UAV communication can significantly reduce computational service capabilities. For this problem, we present a multi-UAV-assisted MEC offloading optimization model that jointly optimizes task offloading decision, UAV resource allocation, UAV trajectories and establish collaborative computation through inter-UAV communication. First, to solve the multi-UAV-assisted MEC offloading optimization issue, we define a weighted utility function that balances delay and energy consumption. Then, to tackle the continuous nature of the computation-offloading problem and the coexistence of discrete and continuous variables, the PPO algorithm is enhanced by integrating an average reward objective function and a hybrid action generation offloading mechanism. Finally, we propose a multi-UAV-assisted MEC computing offloading optimization method to improve the utility function. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly enhances system utility.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The hazards associated with cyber security attacks have increased due to our increasing reliance on digital technologies. We suggest an ensemble strategy employing multiple models of machine learning to get over these restrictions. Our suggested approach detects an extra 141 dangerous URLs, outperforming the single model that is currently in use by 6%. We gathered a collection of malicious and benign URLs for this investigation. Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to feature extraction. Subsequently advantageous features are selected and categorised using the Social Spider optimised Densely-connected Convolutional Caps net (SSO-DCN). The most effective detection frameworks and automated methods for identifying rogue web pages, including those distribute malicious malware, are included in the proposed technology. When comparing the proposed method to the existing approaches, the improvements are in mean accuracy (96.30%), precision (96.90%), F1-Measure (97.20%), recall (96.90%), FPR (3.50%) and FNR (3.90%).},

However, with progress in educational technology, there is an absence of frameworks using Semantic Web capabilities to provide tailored learning experiences and enhance administrative procedures efficiently. Hence, this study proposes a framework called “Education using Semantic Web Tools (E-SWT),” employing ontologies, metadata tagging, and intelligent reasoning systems. The method supports seamless platform interoperability, adaptive content delivery, and efficient resource management. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model increases the learning experience ratio by 96.12%, Organizational Efficiency ratio by 97.53%, Fostering Collaboration by 98.82%, Data Management ratio by 97.68%, and Personalized Learning Paths by 96.66% compared to other existing models.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Advanced persistent threats (APT) attacks are very low-frequency, hidden in network traffic, and it&#39;s difficult to detect APT attacks with traditional detection methods. Therefore, this paper presents a Semantic Web-driven unsupervised detection framework for APT attacks in network traffic, leveraging Enhanced DBSCAN++ and aiNet algorithms. The proposed DBSCAN++ based aiNet clustering algorithm (D-aiNet) is firstly used for clustering the training samples on the extracted network traffic, and then generates a Self Set (Ss) and an Antibody Set (As). In the testing phase, an Immune Network based anomaly detection model (INAD) is employed to match network traffic samples from the selected dataset with antibodies of the Antibody Set (As) in order to detect APT attacks. To validate the effectiveness of UADDN, experimental studies were conducted using the SCVIC-APT-2021 dataset. Compared with UADAIN, and the other detection methods based on K-means clustering, aiNet-HC clustering, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed UADDN shows superior performance in detecting APT attacks.},

Outputs from BERT, including classifier, attention, and encoder layers, are combined with features derived from Semantic Web Technologies and a custom deep learning layer to form a unified representation. The concatenated features are passed to a linear layer for classification. Experiments demonstrate superior performance, achieving 95\% accuracy, 96\% F1-score, and a 0.99 ROC-AUC, outperforming standard machine learning models.

This paper presents a Semantic Web-Based Small Sample Data Recommendation Algorithm Using Weighted Mutual Information, addressing significant challenges posed by data sparsity in conventional recommendation methods. Traditional algorithms often struggle with limited user behavior and item data, resulting in poor recommendations. Our approach utilizes a weighted mutual information similarity algorithm with a smoothing coefficient to better capture relationships among user actions, product features, and contextual tags. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing algorithms, achieving a hit rate exceeding 72% and notable improvements in recommendation coverage. This research not only enhances the effectiveness of recommendation systems in sparse data contexts but also offers valuable insights for future advancements in personalized information retrieval.},

Current methods struggle with complex spatiotemporal data, limiting real-time feature capture and strategy adjustments. To address this, we propose the Semantic Web-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning-based Urban Planning Optimization Model (SWRL-UPOM). Integrating Semantic Web technologies with Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Multimodal Graph Convolutional Network (STAMFGCN) and Spatio-Temporal Gated Hierarchical Attention LSTM (STGHALSTM), SWRL-UPOM uses reinforcement learning to optimize strategies dynamically. STAMFGCN extracts complex inter-regional relationships from multimodal data, while STGHALSTM models and predicts spatiotemporal pollution evolution. Leveraging Semantic Web for structured data and reasoning, the RL framework iteratively updates strategies based on predicted pollution trends. Experiments show SWRL-UPOM outperforms traditional methods in pollution prediction, strategy optimization, and adaptability to dynamic changes.},
