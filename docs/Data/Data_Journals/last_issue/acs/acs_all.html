  abstract     = {Surface-catalyzed polymerization is crucial in both chemical science and industrial manufacturing, yet achieving regioselective radical polymerization on the surface remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the regioselective Ullmann polymerization of nonsymmetrical 2,8-dibromoquinoline (DBQ) on an Au(111) surface. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy, density functional theory calculations, and kinetic modeling, we reveal the regioselectivity and its evolution with surface temperature at the molecular level. At 348–368 K, DBQ monomers primarily form covalent dimers through energetically favored head-to-head (HtH) coupling. As the temperature increases to 390–473 K, oligomers and long polymer chains are formed, with less favored head-to-tail (HtT) linkages emerging and eventually dominating over HtH linkages. Such regioselectivity evolution from HtH to HtT is suggested to be related to a sequential monomer addition mode and a shift in the distribution of reactive sites at the end and tail of the polymer chains during polymerization. This result provides molecular-level mechanistic insights into the regiochemistry of surface-catalyzed polymerization.},

  abstract     = {The simultaneous generation and stabilization of triplet excitons are the key to realizing efficient organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), which is challenging owing to the obscure mechanism and structure–property relationships. Herein, a strategy of lone-pair-mediated multiple through-space interactions (TSIs) is proposed to availably induce RTP. By incorporating heteroatoms to facilitate through-space n–n and n−π interactions, the lone pairs are delocalized throughout the structure, resulting in the dense splitting of the excited-state energy levels. Thus, more matched energy levels with a small energy gap between singlet and triplet states (Δ E ST ) emerge, resulting in multiple intersystem crossing (ISC) transition channels that assist triplet excitons generation. The strong TSIs also effectively rigidify the molecular structures and thus stabilize triplet excitons for radiation. Furthermore, the manipulation of TSI intensity allows efficiency enhancement, persistent time prolongation, and tolerance to high temperatures of RTP. This work not only explores the fundamental principle of the RTP mechanism from a new view but also provides a universal strategy for ISC promotion and triple excitons stabilization.},

Despite recent advances in synthetic methodologies, the asymmetric construction of atropisomers featuring multiple C–N axes has been rarely explored, significantly limiting their further applications. Herein, we report a novel atroposelective synthesis of diaxially chiral pyridoindolones featuring both six–five and six–six C–N axes through cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric C–H annulation. This approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency, yielding a diverse array of chiral pyridoindolones with excellent yields and atroposelectivities (60 examples, up to &gt;99% yield, &gt;99% ee, and &gt;20:1 dr). Mechanistic studies revealed that the stereochemistry of both C–N axes were generated and fixed simultaneously during the C–H cyclometalation step, along with an unexpected asymmetric amplification effect. The practicality of this protocol is further underscored by successful gram-scale syntheses and various transformations, including the formation of a chiral phosphine ligand. Notably, exceptional photoluminescence quantum yields ( Φ F up to 0.99) and positive solvatochromism were observed, coupled with significant chiroptical properties, underscoring the potential applications of these compounds in organic fluorescent materials.},

Herein, we report fully methylated tetramethyl-1,3-dimethoxydisiloxane (TMMS) as a single solvent for lithium metal batteries. We demonstrate that the fully methylated structure and Si–O bonds within TMMS can effectively elevate the dehydrogenation energy barrier, migrating the oxidation decomposition of the electrolyte. Additionally, the weak solvating power of TMMS favors the formation of an anion-rich solvation structure that induces the generation of an inorganic-rich electrode/electrolyte interphase layer at both the cathode and anode. Accordingly, the formulated electrolyte exhibits remarkable stability against high-voltage cathodes and lithium metal anodes. Notably, LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 ||Li (NCM811||Li) full cells with TMMS-based electrolytes realize a significant improvement in capacity retention compared with a dimethoxyethane-based electrolyte at both room temperature and 50 °C.

  abstract     = {The ammonia electrooxidation reaction (AOR) has attracted significant attention for both wastewater treatment and energy storage applications. However, AOR pathways generating oxygenated products such as nitrite or nitrate remain unresolved. Attenuated total reflection–surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR–SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) have been combined to determine the potential-dependent intermediates, active catalytic sites, and AOR pathways on Ni electrodes under alkaline conditions. The OH/O vacancy sites on NiOOH, revealed by XPS, are found by DFT calculations to be the active sites for the AOR, catalyzing the complete (eight-electron) oxidation of ammonia into nitrate. The formation of isolated OH/O vacancies on NiOOH is thermodynamically more favorable than that of paired vacancies in the potential range conducive to NiOOH formation and the AOR, with an increasing formation barrier at higher potentials. This synergistic ATR–SEIRAS and DFT study reveals that the selectivity of nitrite and nitrate production is potential-dependent, with nitrite and hydrazine formation initiated at moderate anodic potentials, whereas larger potentials promote conversion of nitrite into nitrate species. The release of adsorbed nitrite and nitrate, which is crucial for liberating catalytic sites for the continuous AOR, is spectroscopically and computationally shown to be facilitated at relatively low potentials. Comprehending AOR mechanisms on Ni-based catalysts as achieved in this study can pave the way for future research on catalyst design and optimization of AOR performance.},

In this work, we present an innovative strategy─SSW-NN (stochastic surface walking with neural network)─a robust, non-neutron diffraction-dependent technique that accurately predicts hydrogen positions. Validated against neutron diffraction data for copper hydride clusters, SSW-NN proved effective for clusters where only X-ray diffraction data or DFT predictions are available. It offers superior accuracy, efficiency, and versatility across different metal hydrides, including silver and alloy hydride systems, currently without any neutron diffraction references. This approach not only establishes a new research paradigm for metal hydride clusters but also provides a universal solution for hydrogen localization in other research fields constrained by neutron sources.},

In a PD-L1 antibody-treated model, we demonstrated the feasibility of STAMP and revealed a robust positive correlation between the nascent EpCAM + EV levels and tumor volume. Proteome profiling of isolated nascent tEVs identified previously unknown upregulated vesicle proteins following immunotherapy, including key regulators of immune activation and suppression, suggesting that tumors orchestrate an intricate dual adaptive response through tEV secretion modulation to simultaneously elicit therapeutic sensitivity and resistance. Notably, among the upregulated proteins, we identified HSP70, whose enhanced presentation on tEVs promotes antitumor immunity and inhibits tumor growth. Thus, STAMP provides an effective gateway for studying EV dynamics with cell-origin accuracy and for identifying potential therapeutic targets based on EV transitions.},

Notably, dysregulation of LDs is tightly linked to numerous diseases, including lipodystrophies, cancer, obesity, atherosclerosis, and others. The pivotal physiological roles of LDs have led to an exploration of research in recent years. The functions of LDs are inherently connected to the composition of their proteome. Current methods for profiling LD proteins mostly utilize LD fractionation, including those based on proximity-based labeling techniques. Global profiling of the LD proteome in live cells without the isolation of LDs is still challenging. Herein, we disclose two small-molecule chemical probes, termed LDF and LDPL . Both LDF / LDPL are small in size and could freely and specifically migrate within the lipid context of LDs. Consequently, they were successfully used for live-cell fluorescence imaging of LDs and from animal tissues. We further showed that LDPL was capable of large-scale profiling of the LD proteome without the need of LD isolation. By using LDPL , 1584 high-confidence proteins, most of which could be annotated to prominent LD functions, were next identified. Importantly, further validation studies by using representative “hit” proteins revealed that CHMP6 and PRDX4 could act as the lipophagy receptor and lipolysis suppressor, respectively. Our results thus confirmed for the first time that LDPL is a powerful chemical tool for in situ profiling of LD proteomes. With the ability to provide a deeper understanding of LD proteomics from the native cellular environments, our newly developed strategy may be used in future to decipher the dynamics and molecular mechanism of LDs in various diseases.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectrics with switchable spontaneous polarization have gained enormous attention for a century. However, the structural phase transitions of conventional ferroelectrics have been mainly limited to the ones with crystallographic point group changes accompanied by the breaking of spatial symmetry elements. Moreover, although chiral and photoswitchable ferroelectrics have both been of great interest in recent years, heteroatomic chiral photoswitchable ferroelectrics have never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we designed a pair of sulfur-chiral photoswitchable ferroelectrics ( R s and S s ) -N -(3-bromo-5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-methylpropane-2-sulfinamide (1- R s and 1- S s ). Notably, they undergo a structural phase transition from the chiral polar C 2 to P 2 1 space group of point group 2 at around 142 K, accompanied by the symmetry operation breaking from 2-fold rotation and screw rotation in C 2 to only 2-fold screw rotation in P 2 1 . Such a structural phase transition with the same point group, while different space groups with the breaking of symmetry operations, is significantly distinct from the structural phase transition with different point groups and space groups in conventional ferroelectrics. Furthermore,1- R s exhibits the highest piezoelectric d 33 value of 10 pC/N among organic photoswitchable ferroelectrics and shows optical control of ferroelectric polarization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of sulfur-chiral photoswitchable ferroelectrics showing phase transitions with only the space group change. This work enriches the family of chiral ferroelectrics and provides great inspiration for the exploitation of heteroatomic chiral photoswitchable ferroelectrics.},

Upon compression, ( S / R -3-ClPEA) 2 PbBr 4 exhibits significant piezofluorochromic behaviors, transforming from yellow CPL to ultrahigh-color-purity deep-blue CPL. At 2.5 GPa, the deep-blue CPL intensity increases by an order of magnitude and its luminescence asymmetry factors ( g lum ) are amplified from the initial ±0.03 to ±0.1.

High-pressure structural characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that pressure-enhanced halogen bonds reduce the penetration depth of S / R -3-BrPEA + and S / R -3-ClPEA + into the [PbBr 6 ] 4– frameworks, significantly suppressing electron–phonon coupling and increasing magnetic transition dipole moment in ( S / R -3-BrPEA) 2 PbBr 4 and ( S / R -3-ClPEA) 2 PbBr 4 , which are responsible for the ultrahigh-purity deep-blue CPL and chirality amplification, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The enzymatic synthesis of heterocycles is an emerging biotechnology for the sustainable construction of societally important molecules. Herein, we describe an enzyme-mediated strategy for the oxidative dimerization of thioamides enabled by enzymatic halide recycling by vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase enzymes. This approach allows for intermolecular biocatalytic bond formation using a catalytic quantity of halide salt and hydrogen peroxide as the terminal oxidant. The established method is applied to a diverse range of thioamides to generate the corresponding 1,2,4-thiadiazoles in moderate to high yields with excellent chemoselectivity. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds through two distinct enzyme-mediated sulfur halogenation events that are critical for heterocycle formation. Molecular docking experiments provide insight into reactivity differences between biocatalysts used in this study. Finally, the developed biocatalytic oxidative dimerization is applied to a preparative scale chemoenzymatic synthesis of the anticancer agent penicilliumthiamine B. These studies demonstrate that enzymatic halide recycling is a promising platform for intermolecular bond formation.},

  abstract     = {We report on a head-to-tail dual molecular motor consisting of two (identical) motor units whose pyrrole-2-carboxylic rings are turned in contra-rotary (i.e., disrotatory) fashion about a common phenyl-2,5-dicarboxylic acid stator. The motors directionally rotate via information ratchet mechanisms, in which the hydration of a carbodiimide (fuel) to form urea (waste) is catalyzed through the chemomechanical cycle of a motor unit, resulting in directional rotation about a biaryl C–N bond. The head-to-tail arrangement of the motor units produces coaxial contra-rotation of the end groups while the central phenyl ring of the axis remains dynamically unbiased. The electron-rich nature of the phenyl stator contributes to rotary catalysis by the dual-motor (and therefore motor rotation itself) being ∼7× faster than the parent 1-phenylpyrrole-2,2-dicarboxylic acid single-motor when operated under identical conditions, and 90× faster than the single-motor operated using the originally reported reaction conditions. Under batch-fueled operation (i.e., all of the fuel present at the start of motor operation), the dual-motor rotates at an initial rate of 0.43 rotations per minute (rpm). Chemostating the fuel concentration by syringe pump addition produced sustained repetitive contra-rotation at a rate of 0.24 rpm for a period of 100 min. The demonstration of chemically fueled continuous contra-rotation on a time scale of 2–4 min per rotation significantly advances the chemistry and mechanics of artificial catalysis-driven molecular machinery.},

  abstract     = {The partial hydrogenation of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a great opportunity to produce valuable chemicals, yet achieving precise catalytic control remains challenging. Herein, for the first time, we realized one-pot selective hydrogenation of waste PET to p -toluic acid ( p -TA) with a record-high yield of 53.4%, alongside a 36.4% yield of p -xylene (PX), using a specially designed PtW/MCM-48 catalyst. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the exceptional catalytic performance arises from synergistic interaction between Pt nanoparticles and WO x species. Low-valent WO x enhances Pt dispersion, while Pt stabilizes WO x as low-polymerized polytungstates. The moderate acidity of PtW 1.5 /MCM-48 ensures controlled desorption of p -TA, preventing overhydrogenation to PX. The catalyst demonstrated robust performance with real-world PET waste. Life cycle assessment and technical and economic evaluation further highlight its practical feasibility. This study establishes a sustainable pathway for PET chemical upcycling and provides a framework for designing advanced catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, addressing critical challenges in circular chemistry and plastic waste management.},

Herein is presented the use of the diterpenoids steviol and isosteviol as starting points for the construction of &gt;50 new compounds through this complexity-to-diversity approach, featuring novel ring system distortions and a noteworthy thallium(III) nitrate (TTN)-mediated ring fusion. Evaluation of this collection identified SteviX4 as a potent and selective anticancer compound, inducing cell death at low nanomolar concentrations against some cancer cell lines in culture, compared to micromolar activity against others. SteviX4 induces ferroptotic cell death in susceptible cell lines, and target identification experiments reveal SteviX4 acts as an inhibitor of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a critical protein that protects cancer cells against ferroptosis. In its induction of cell death, SteviX4 displays enhanced cell line selectivity relative to most known GPX4 inhibitors. SteviX4 was used to reveal dependency on GPX4 as a vulnerability of certain cancer cell lines, not tied to any one type of cancer, suggesting GPX4 inhibition as a cancer type-agnostic anticancer strategy. With its high fraction of sp 3 -hybridized carbons and considerable cell line selectivity and potency, SteviX4 is unique among GPX4 inhibitors, serving as an outstanding probe compound and basis for further translational development.},

Here we describe that a cavity modulation strategy enables metal-linked polyaromatic capsules to quantitatively bind PFCs with excellent selectivity. From a mixture of perfluoroarene and the corresponding perfluoroalkane (i.e., perfluoronaphthalene and perfluorodecalin), a Pt(II)-linked capsule exclusively binds the arenes in water at room temperature, via effective D-A-A-D π-stacking interactions. The size-selective binding toward perfluoroarenes (i.e., perfluoronaphthalene and perfluorobenzene) is improved by using the analogous N-doped capsule from 85% to quantitative selectivity. Furthermore, unlike the Pt(II)-capsule, an isostructural Pd(II)-linked capsule displays the unusual length/shape-selective binding of linear/cyclic perfluoroalkanes (i.e., perfluoroheptane and perfluorodecalin) under similar conditions. Recognition of substituted hydrogen atoms on perfluorobiphenyl can also be accomplished using the Pt(II)-capsule. Various PFCs are thus clearly distinguished for the first time by the modulable polyaromatic capsules under ambient aqueous conditions.},

Mucus is composed of polymeric networks of mucin proteins, which are heavily modified post-translationally. The full compendium of enzymes responsible for these modifications and their roles in health and disease remain incompletely understood. Herein, we determine the biochemical function of NXPE1 , a gene implicated in ulcerative colitis (UC), and demonstrate that it encodes an acetyltransferase that modifies mucin glycans. Specifically, NXPE1 utilizes acetyl-CoA to regioselectively modify the mucus sialic acid, 5- N -acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), at the 9-OH group to generate 9- O -acetylated Neu5Ac (Neu5,9Ac 2 ). We further demonstrate that colonic organoids derived from donors harboring the missense variant NXPE1 G353R, which is protective against UC, exhibit severely impaired acetylation of Neu5Ac on mucins. Together, our findings support a model in which NXPE1 masks the alcohols of mucus sialoglycans via acetylation, which is important for modulating mucus barrier properties that limit interactions with commensal microbes.},

  abstract     = {In nature, organisms produce various bioactive natural products (NPs). Most NPs target naturally occurring macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleotides. Thus, NPs are produced in a stereocontrolled manner except for the cases where nonenzymatic reactions are involved in the biosynthesis. This is why stereoisomers, especially enantiomers, are rarely found among metabolites from natural sources. During the biosynthetic study of auranthine, a fungal NP containing a nitrile group, we discovered that the (−)-isomer of auranthine ( 1 ) is produced by Aspergillus lentulus strains isolated in Japan, while a previously unreported (+)-enantiomer 2 is produced by those isolated elsewhere. The biosynthetic genes for both isomers were determined by transcriptomic, gene deletion, and heterologous expression experiments, revealing that two different nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) NitA and NitC were involved in the biosynthesis of 1 and 2 , respectively. Both NitA and NitC are bimodular NRPSs, as is the case for the asperlicin-synthesizing enzyme AspA. All incorporate two molecules of anthranilic acid and one molecule of amino acid to form the peptide core. However, only NitC contains an epimerization domain, suggesting that is how the enantiomeric pair is biosynthesized by NitA and NitC. Furthermore, biosynthesis of the nitrile-bearing l -γ-cyanohomoalanine that is incorporated into 1 and 2 was found to be catalyzed by an argininosuccinate synthetase-like NitB using l -glutamine as a substrate. This study reports not only the unique mechanism of nitrile-containing amino acid biosynthesis but also the intriguing production of an enantiomeric pair of secondary metabolites by different strains of the same fungal species (250/250).},

  abstract     = {The ferryl heme forms of Staphylococcus aureus IsdG and IsdI have novel UV/vis absorption spectra that are distinct from those of the three forms of ferryl heme typically found in biological systems: compound I, compound II, and compound ES. In this work, the ferryl heme form of IsdG was characterized because it is an analogue for the immediate product of enzyme-catalyzed heme hydroxylation. The ferryl heme form of IsdG generated following the addition of meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to the ferric heme form of IsdG has a half-life of 4.0 ± 0.2 min, which is more than 100 times longer than the half-life for the ferryl heme form of human heme oxygenase (hHO). Magnetic circular dichroism characterization of the IsdG species yielded spectral data and zero-field splitting parameters consistent with either a compound II- or compound ES-like ferryl heme. Further characterization of isotopically enriched samples with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the presence of a protein-based organic radical, as would be expected for compound ES. Finally, multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and time-dependent density functional theory strongly suggest that the ferryl heme form of IsdG has a ruffled porphyrin ligand and an oxo ligand. Thus, the ferryl heme form of IsdG is assigned to a compound ES-like species with a Trp67-based radical. Electron transfer from Trp67 to porphyrin will stabilize the immediate product of heme hydroxylation and provide a thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. Furthermore, the ability to transfer an electron between Trp67 and the substrate may explain the differential reactivity of meso-hydroxyheme in IsdG and hHO.},

  abstract     = {The scientific community has been actively researching artificial photosynthesis to promote ecologically sustainable living and address environmental issues. However, designing photocatalysts with active sites that are effective for both CO 2 reduction and water oxidation remains a significant challenge. Thus, we present the development of a donor–acceptor covalent organic framework (D–A COF), that integrates two distinct metal coordination environments through structure–activity relationships. Either cobalt or nickel ion is anchored on the D–A COF backbone to create N-metal–nitrogen and N-metal–sulfur coordination configurations, serving as bifunctional reduction and oxidation active sites, respectively. Remarkably, the as-synthesized Co-Btt-Bpy COF generated CO at a rate of 9,800 μmol g –1 h –1 and O 2 at 242 μmol g –1 h –1 under visible light irradiation. The CO generation rate was 127 times higher than that of pristine D–A COF. More importantly, Co-Btt-Bpy COF facilitates artificial photosynthesis with a CO release rate of 7.4 μmol g –1 h –1 . The outstanding photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the dispersed single-atom sites and Btt-Bpy COF, as well as the rapid migration of photogenerated electrons. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectra and theoretical calculations indicated that introducing Co sites effectively lowered the reaction energy barriers for the crucial intermediates *COOH and *OH. This work provides state-of-the-art designs of photocatalysts at the molecular level and in-depth insights for efficient artificial photosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {To realize human-machine fusion, a hybrid neural pathway operating in the same modality with biological systems becomes imperative, which requires an interneuron unit to encode information in biorecognizable spike sequences and tune the frequency upon excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Existing artificial interneurons cannot encode information upon different neurotransmitters, and the activation threshold and frequency responsivity do not align with those of biological counterparts, leading to limited success in constructing a signal-harmonizing hybrid neural pathway for neuroprosthetics, neurorehabilitation, and other neuroelectronic applications. Herein, we develop a bipolar-chemosynapse interneuron to encode the spike frequency in a highly bionic paradigm. Bipolar synapses dynamically respond to excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and translate time-series chemical signals into the spike sequence, achieving the lowest activation threshold (6.25 μM) and the highest frequency responsivity (0.55 Hz μM –1 ) to date, close to the biological counterpart. A signal-harmonizing hybrid sensorimotor pathway mediated by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is constructed for the first time, which encodes upstream mechanical stimuli, modulates the downstream leg swing frequency of a mouse, and balances neural activity accordingly.},

  abstract     = {The 1-dihydrobenzazepine skeleton has emerged as a privileged structural motif in bioactive molecules. However, due to a lack of asymmetric methodology, access to chiral 1-dihydrobenzazepines has remained limited. Herein, we report the first intermolecular asymmetric cycloisomerization of benzo-fused enynes for the synthesis of chiral 1-dihydrobenzazepines via dirhodium catalysis. This methodology features high efficiency (up to 98% yield), high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee), and broad scope of nucleophiles, including oxygen nucleophiles (alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids) and carbon nucleophiles (silyl enol ethers). Theoretical and experimental mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction pathway encompasses an asymmetric cycloisomerization, which gives rise to a dirhodium carbene containing a donor–acceptor (D-A) cyclopropane moiety, followed by a ring-opening process and stereoselective nucleophilic attack by external nucleophiles on the cyclopropyl ring. Control experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of the terminal group capped on the alkynyl group of substrates in achieving good efficiency.},

We hypothesized that replacing the oxygen atom in the glycosidic linkage with sulfur atoms would stabilize the labile linkage against glycosidases, resulting in improved pharmacokinetics. In this study, we focused on the macrophage-activating factor (MAF) carrying O -linked N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and creating a miniature glycopeptide associated with MAF. A partial structure of MAF with a chemical mutation at three amino acid residues was designed in which threonine was replaced with cysteine (Cys), leading to a thioglycosidically linked GalNAc and a conformationally stable cyclic peptide due to the disulfide bond. GalNAc-Cys was used in solid-phase peptide synthesis, and the desired cyclic glycopeptide was synthesized. In the synthesis of GalNAc-Cys, glycosylation reactions were carried out based on the hard and soft acids and bases concept, where glycosyl trichloroacetimidate and fluoride were successfully used to couple with the thiol group in Cys. GalNAc-Cys was also evaluated as a substrate of α-GalNAc-ase and was shown to resist hydrolysis, supporting our concept. The synthesized cyclic miniature MAF induced LPS-assisted IL-12 production and resisted against α-GalNAc-ase.},

  abstract     = {Mechanically interlocked networks (MINs) with dense mechanical bonds can amplify the dynamic behaviors of the mechanical bonds to exhibit decent mechanical properties. Energy dissipation resulting from mechanical bond motion is essential for improving toughness, yet effective strategies to optimize this process remain underexplored. Here, by designing mechanical bond models with controllable mobility, we establish a fortification strategy for the two key factors governing energy dissipation, host–guest recognition and sliding friction, thereby enabling mechanical property enhancement of mechanically interlocked materials. Specifically, the [2]rotaxanes in MIN- 1 and MIN- 2 exhibit identical axle structures, with MIN- 1 incorporating a small benzo-21-crown-7 ring and MIN- 2 incorporating a large benzo-24-crown-8 ring. Strain rate-dependent cyclic tensile tests reveal that the energy required to drive mechanical bond motion in MIN- 1 and MIN- 2 is 510 and 260 kJ/m 3 , respectively, indicating that the small wheel size enhances host–guest recognition. Furthermore, the apparent activation energy for the sliding motion of the mechanical bonds in MIN- 1 (11.0 kJ/mol) is higher than that in MIN- 2 (6.70 kJ/mol), suggesting increased sliding friction in MIN- 1 . Due to these two aspects, MIN- 1 exhibits superior energy dissipation performance (damping capacity = 92%) compared to MIN- 2 (78%), translating to a higher toughness (7.50 vs 5.70 MJ/m 3 ).},

  abstract     = {Research on room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been rapidly developed in recent years. However, it is still challenging to realize long-wavelength RTP (&gt;580 nm). In this article, a new strategy is proposed to achieve the red-shifted RTP through constructing dual-ligand MOFs. Different from the single-ligand MOF, which lacks intermolecular interaction, the dual-ligand MOF can build up a stable donor–acceptor (D-A) relationship between two suitable simple ligands. Therefore, the induced charge transfer (CT) process from the donor units to the acceptor units in the framework can decrease the energy gap between the frontier orbitals, reducing the excited state energy levels. Moreover, by modulating the electron density and conjugation of the acceptor ligand, the energy of the triplet states of MOFs can be further reduced. As a result, the RTP centered at 588 nm is successfully achieved in a dual-ligand MOF. Also, we clearly describe the electron transporting path among the ground, 1 CT, and 3 CT states, revealing the emitting mechanism of the long-wavelength RTP. This work not only extends the D–A structure from the molecular level to the periodic structure of MOFs but also solves the problem of achieving long-wavelength RTP in MOFs from a new perspective.},

  abstract     = {The efficient removal of CO 2 from exhaust streams and even directly from air is necessary to forestall climate change, lending urgency to the search for new materials that can rapidly capture CO 2 at high capacity. The recent discovery that diamine-appended metal–organic frameworks can exhibit cooperative CO 2 uptake via the formation of ammonium carbamate chains begs the question of whether simple organic polyamine molecules could be designed to achieve a similar switch-like behavior with even higher separation capacities. Here, we present a solid molecular triamine, 1,3,5-tris(aminomethyl)benzene (TriH), that rapidly captures large quantities of CO 2 upon exposure to humid air to form the porous, crystalline, ammonium carbamate network solid TriH(CO 2 ) 1.5 · x H 2 O (TriHCO 2 ). The phase transition behavior of TriH converting to TriHCO 2 was studied through powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and additional spectroscopic techniques further verified the formation of ammonium carbamate species upon exposing TriH to humid air. Detailed breakthrough analyses conducted under varying temperatures, relative humidities, and flow rates reveal record CO 2 absorption capacities as high as 8.9 mmol/g. Computational analyses reveal an activation barrier associated with TriH absorbing CO 2 under dry conditions that is lowered under humid conditions through hydrogen bonding with a water molecule in the transition state associated with N–C bond formation. These results highlight the prospect of tunable molecular polyamines as a new class of candidate absorbents for high-capacity CO 2 capture.},

  abstract     = {While nucleic-acid-based cancer vaccines hold therapeutic potential, their limited immunogenicity remains a challenge due in part to the low efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery caused by lysosomal entrapment. In this work, we found that plasmids encoding both an antigen and a STING agonist protein adjuvant can self-assemble into coordination nanofibers, triggered by manganese ions. We developed a strategy to construct a DNA vaccine, termed MnO 2 -OVA-CDA-mem, formed by the coencapsulation of manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ), an antigen-expressing plasmid (encoding ovalbumin, OVA), and an adjuvant enzyme-expressing plasmid (encoding STING agonist, CDA) within dendritic cell (DC) membranes. Upon uptake into acidic lysosomes, Mn 2+ released from MnO 2 triggered the nucleic acids to undergo a morphological change from nanospheres (∼180 nm diameter) to nanofibers (∼1 μm length), resulting in an increase in mechanical strength by about 9-fold and consequently lysosomal membrane disruption. The antigen OVA and adjuvants Mn 2+ and CDA in the cytoplasm triggered strong DC activation and antigen-specific CD8 + T cell metalloimmune responses, significantly inhibiting the growth of B16-OVA tumors and inducing long-term immune memory. Altogether, MnO 2 -OVA-CDA-mem holds potential as a platform for nucleic acid antigen and adjuvant delivery using an in situ self-assembly strategy in a metal-driven, stimulus-responsive, and programmable manner for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Direct electrochemical ethylene-to-ethylene glycol (C 2 H 4 -to-EG) conversion can potentially reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and the emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) compared with the traditional thermo-catalytic approach. Palladium (Pd) prepared by electrodeposition is represented as a promising electrocatalyst; however, it exhibits low Ethylene glycol (EG) current density (&lt;4 mA cm –2 ), Faradaic efficiency (&lt;60%), and productivity (&lt;10 μmol h –1 ), hindering practical applications. Herein, we report a nanodendrite palladium catalyst supported on a large-area gas diffusion electrode. This catalyst gives high EG current density (12 mA cm –2 ) and productivity (227 μmol h –1 ) but low Faradaic efficiency (65%). With further Cl – ions modification, Faradaic efficiency increased to a record-high value of 92%, and EG current density (18 mA cm –2 ) and productivity (∼340 μmol h –1 ) were also promoted. Experimental data suggest that the strong electron-withdrawing feature of Cl – reduces the oxidation ability of in situ generated Pd–OH species, inhibiting EG overoxidation to glycol aldehyde. Meanwhile, Cl – alters EG adsorption configuration─from parallel and dual-site coordination to vertical and single-site coordination─over the Pd surface, thus preventing C–C bond cleavage of EG to CO 2 . In addition, Cl – adsorption facilitates the generation of Pd–OH active species to improve catalytic activity. This work demonstrates the great potential of surface ion modification for improving activity and selectivity in direct electrochemical C 2 H 4 -to-EG conversion, which may have implications for diverse value-added chemicals electrosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {The many emerging applications of nanoparticles in diverse fields in chemistry and biology require the characterization of interactions between nanoparticles and surrounding biomolecules such as proteins. Nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation of proteins, which is highly sensitive to interactions with nanoparticles, contains rich information about protein mobility and binding kinetics. The interactions of globular proteins with silica nanoparticles differ markedly from those with liposome nanoparticles, although both are driven by electrostatic forces. For unmodified silica nanoparticles, their interactions with an internally rigid protein like ubiquitin uniformly increase the backbone amide 15 N transverse R 2 relaxation for most residues. In contrast, for ubiquitin-POPG liposome interactions, their characteristic transverse R 2 profiles indicate that ubiquitin undergoes diffusive rotational motions on the liposome surface. Here, we show that coating silica nanoparticles with sulfobetaine siloxane zwitterionic molecules profoundly alters their interactions with proteins in a manner that closely resembles the mode of interaction observed with liposomes. 15 N- R 2 relaxation reveals that ubiquitin and the Ras-binding domain of B-Raf both exhibit axial reorientational motions about an axis perpendicular to the nanoparticle surface in the bound state, where the interactions involve predominantly positively charged surface regions. These findings point toward a global dynamics mechanism of proteins when interacting with organic or inorganic nanoparticles with densely charged soft surfaces. This information may help tailor the coatings of nanoparticles to adopt specific modes of interaction with proteins that can be used to control their function in vivo and in vitro.},

This study aims to determine how the optoelectronic properties of a model perovskite, cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr 3 ), change with length and thickness in one dimension (1D). By examining the photophysics of CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs), nanowires (NWs), and nanorods (NRs), we observe the influence of confinement, exciton diffusion, and trapping on their optical properties. Our findings reveal that exciton diffusion to trap states limits the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 1D CsPbBr 3 in the weakly confined regime (8–14 nm) and explains their long-lived exciton dynamics, while enhanced radiative rates contribute to achieving near-unity PLQY in the strongly confined regime (&lt;7 nm). Consequently, blue-emitting, 2.4 nm-thick CsPbBr 3 NRs were 3.6X more emissive than the conventional CsPbBr 3 QDs. This study underscores how structural optimization can improve the optoelectronic performance of CsPbBr 3 and provides insight into the complex interplay of radiative and nonradiative processes in 1D ionic semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {With the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and their detrimental effect on the environment, there is a push to develop a renewable way to produce H 2 , a fuel source that has nonharmful byproducts, unlike traditional methods of energy production. Alkaline water electrolysis has seen increasing focus as a viable way to produce H 2 , but efficient and stable electrocatalysts are required to facilitate this process. Here, a heterogenized Co(II) phenanthroline-based complex for the production of H 2 from alkaline water is disclosed. Activity was improved by considering the role of axial Co ligation and the reaction environment created by the polymer binder in the catalyst inks by using variable ratios of Nafion and poly-4-vinylpyridine (P4VP). A ratio of 1:1 Nafion:P4VP was found to have the highest stability, and Co nanoparticle formation was not observed when P4VP was included as part of the binder mixture. The activity and stability enhancement could not be replicated by the addition of molecular pyridine or the use of poly-2-vinylpyridine, which is sterically prevented from coordinating to Co. The increased electrochemical performance caused by the inclusion of Nafion as part of the polymer binder is attributed to a role in mass transfer to and from the Co active site during catalysis, complementing the stabilizing effect of P4VP on the molecular active site.},

  abstract     = {Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely used for delivering therapeutic nucleic acids, yet the relationship between their internal structure and intracellular behavior, particularly before RNA release, remains unclear. Here, we elucidate how lipid-siRNA organization within LNPs can modulate their intracellular delivery dynamics. We use cryo-electron microscopy and photochemical assays to reveal that increased siRNA loading can reduce helper lipids’ distribution to the LNP surface, while siRNA consistently localizes near the surface. These alterations in lipid-siRNA organization affect LNP membrane fluidity, enhancing LNP fusion with cellular membranes and promoting cytosolic siRNA delivery, primarily via macropinocytosis. Using photosensitive lipids and live cell imaging, we demonstrate that lipid-siRNA organization regulates LNP responsiveness to external stimuli, significantly affecting siRNA endosomal escape efficiency upon light activation. We further confirm this observation using convex lens-induced confinement microscopy and single-particle imaging. Overall, our findings provide critical insights into how lipid-siRNA organization shapes LNP intracellular dynamics, offering rational design principles for optimizing LNP-based RNA therapeutics.},

However, the spin-electric coupling strength appears to be insufficient for application in most cases. Two major factors capable of amplifying the relative effect are spin–orbit coupling and ferroelectricity. Herein, we chose four compounds as examples to study the contribution of spin–orbit coupling and ferroelectricity to spin-electric coupling. The relative orientation-dependent Hamiltonian terms were determined via electric-field modulated continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance. The origins of the spin-electric coupling effect in the four compounds are discussed and determined according to the characteristics of the experimental spectra. Meanwhile, the results demonstrated that strong spin–orbit coupling is crucial for producing significant spin-electric coupling and that the effect can be amplified by about 2 orders of magnitude by ferroelectricity. This work can guide the rational screen and design of materials with applicable spin-electric coupling strength, which may provoke techniques including low-power spintronics and precise manipulation of the quantum behavior of spins.},

However, the molecular basis for hydrogen shifts and cyclizations, which determine STS product distributions, remains enigmatic. In this study, an elusive STS SydA was identified in the biosynthesis of sydonol, which synthesized a new bisabolene-type sesquiterpene 6 with a unique saturated terminal pendant isopentane. Extensive evidence from isotope labeling experiments, crystal structures of SydA and its variant, quantum chemical calculations, and mutagenesis experiments reveal a plausible mechanism for the formation of 6 involving an unusual 1,7-hydride shift, which may be a key branchpoint for monocyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic products. Structure-based engineering resulted in SydA variants that promote different reaction pathways, leading to the production of bicyclic α-cuprenene and (+)-β-chamigrene and tricyclic 7- epi -β-cedrene and β-microbiotene. These findings not only reveal a new bisabolene and its biosynthesis but also provide insights into the molecular basis of the hydride shifts and cyclizations, which pave the way for engineering STSs to produce complex terpenoid products.},

However, the creation of uniform and well-defined PAH nanostructures by self-assembly still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report that highly uniform hexagonal rods can be obtained from triphenylene (TP)-derived monomers by synchronized polymerization and self-assembly (SPSA). These rods have a single-domain columnar liquid crystalline structure in which columns formed from stacked TPs are along the long axis of the rods. The length/diameter ratios of the rods can be tuned over a wide range. Key factors to achieve SPSA of PAHs were analyzed, and the formation mechanism was clarified. In particular, it is observed that successful SPSA occurs below an upper critical temperature, which could be attributed to insufficient microphase separation between the side chains and the main chains and should be a general principle for SPSA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the columnar stacking of TP units significantly promotes the intersystem crossing of the singlet excited state to the triplet excited state, resulting in simultaneous fluorescence and phosphorescence emission at room temperature. This work may be extended to a wide range of PAHs to regulate their self-assembly and light emission properties.},

The process involves the generation of CO 2 radical anions via the barrierless attachment of hydrated electrons to CO 2 , facilitating an ambient, continuous carboxylation of C 2 H 4 with an efficiency of 81.4%. Utilizing easily available electron beam irradiation, we achieved a combined production rate of 0.34 mmol L –1 min –1 for carboxylic acids, which is unattainable by the existing methods. Notably, product selectivity between hydro- and dicarboxylation was dose-rate/beam intensity-dependent: high-dose-rate irradiation favored succinic acid formation with a proportional yield of up to 65.4%, while milder conditions resulted in an 85.1% yield of propionic acid. We suggested that the simplicity and efficiency of the present carboxylation approach promote circular carbon in the sustainable chemical industry.},

  abstract     = {The assembly of molecules or nanoparticles (NPs) into superlattice metamaterials endows them with remarkable optical, electrical, and magnetic properties, enabling applications in sensing, catalysis, and optical displays. However, traditional methods face challenges, such as complex procedures, long processing times, limited assembly areas, and poor reproducibility. The root cause of these challenges lies mainly in the complex and difficult-to-control interactions between assembly units such as ligands and NPs. In this study, a novel ultralow-interfacial-energy microenvironment between the water and oil phase is proposed for a rapid and large-scale superlattice assembly of NPs. The formation of the independently formed interfacial “third-phase” microenvironment hinges on two crucial factors. First, there is high immiscibility between densely packed perfluorodecanethiol ligands and a biphasic solvent system. Second, the coalescence events are accelerated at elevated temperatures. This microenvironment plays a dual role. Thermodynamically, it mitigates interparticle sintering and promotes the rapid establishment of supersaturation conditions that are conducive to the homogeneous nucleation of superlattices. Kinetically, it accelerates the coalescence process of “superlattice domains” through van der Waals interactions between neighboring NPs. This strategy reduces assembly time to under 80 min for forming superlattice monolayer films over areas up to 11 cm 2 . Furthermore, the method is versatile, applicable to mono- and double-layer superlattices with subnanometer- to micrometer-scale materials. This work represents a breakthrough in traditional superlattice construction concepts. It offers new perspectives for ultrafast and large-scale superlattice assembly and broadens the application prospects of superlattice films of NPs in burgeoning fields such as biosensing and flexible displays.},

  abstract     = {Green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (PCFPs) of the EosFP family are commonly used in ensemble pulse-chase and single-molecule localization or tracking approaches. However, these fluorescent proteins exhibit highly complex photophysical behaviors. In the green-form, recent NMR experiments revealed that mEos4b and other PCFP variants exist in two different conformational states at thermal equilibrium, which limits their effective photoconversion efficiency. Here, we investigate the conformational heterogeneity of mEos4b in the photoconverted red-form, employing a combination of solution NMR, UV–vis spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging. Only a single red population of mEos4b is observed at thermal equilibrium. However, a second population emerges under illumination with 405 or 488 nm light, which slowly decays in the dark or can be swiftly reverted under 561 nm light. This second population manifests itself through a pH-dependent positive photoswitching mechanism that adds to the already characterized negative photoswitching assigned to cis – trans isomerization of the chromophore. Our data indicate that positive photoswitching, instead, results from the light-induced formation of a second fluorescent state with a cis configuration of the chromophore that exhibits a substantially increased p K a . Such a mechanism, suggested to result from rewiring of the H-bonding network around the first amino acid of the chromophore, adds to the panoply of switching scenarios observed in fluorescent proteins. It bears consequences for the spectroscopic characterization of PCFPs, reduces their apparent brightness and generates short-lived off-times perturbing single-molecule localization microscopy applications.},

Herein, our study introduces a novel approach. We demonstrate that a PtZn-ZnO x catalyst featuring a PtZn intermetallic structure with abundant PtZn-ZnO x interfaces on the surface allows for the electrocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid with an impressive selectivity of 99.5% at a low potential of 0.725 V (vs a reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which is 0.6 V lower than most reported studies. This high selectivity is a testament to the efficiency of our catalyst, as it significantly reduces the occurrence of side reactions, leading to a more efficient and sustainable process. The experimental and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the adsorption of Ph–CH 2 OH and Ph–CHO and the generation of electrophilic OH* were promoted due to the unsaturated coordination of the Zn atom in the PtZn-ZnO x interfaces. Furthermore, the potential-determining step of coupling OH* with Ph–CHO was promoted due to the low energy barrier at the PtZn-ZnO x interface, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

A defining feature of all trichothecenes is their central tricyclic 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (EPT) motif. Although the formation of the EPT central skeleton has long been presumed to be a spontaneous process, the nonenzymatic cyclization reaction forming the tetrahydropyran ring in EPT requires acid catalysis; otherwise, it occurs too slowly to sustain efficient trichothecene biosynthesis under physiological conditions. Here, we resolved this decades-old problem by identifying the missing enzymes for EPT biosynthesis. We demonstrate that the C11 hydroxyl group of universal trichothecene precursors, isotrichodiol and isotrichotriol, must be acetylated by a strictly conserved O -acetyltransferase Tri3 to furnish a better leaving group. These acetylated intermediates preferentially undergo spontaneous allylic rearrangement with water to give shunt products, trichodiol and trichotriol. Therefore, a novel cyclase, Tri14, which was previously annotated as a hypothetical protein, is required to overcome the kinetically unfavored oxide bridge closure and meanwhile suppress the spontaneous formation of any shunt products.},

  abstract     = {Triterpenoids and steroids are structurally complex polycyclic natural products with potent biological functions, for example, as hormones. In all eukaryotes, the carbon skeletons of these compounds are generated by oxidosqualene cyclases, which carry out a polycyclization cascade to generate four or five rings with up to nine stereogenic centers in a targeted manner. The tight stereochemical control of this cascade reaction severely limits the stereochemical space accessible by known oxidosqualene cyclases. Considering that naturally occurring hormone stereoisomers have markedly different biological activities, finding ways to produce stereoisomers of triterpenes would be highly desirable to open new avenues for developing triterpenoid and steroid drugs. Here, we present a plant kingdom-wide sequence mining approach based on sequence similarity networks to search for noncanonical oxidosqualene cyclases that might produce triterpene stereoisomers. From 1,891 oxidosqualene cyclase sequences representing the diversity of green plants, six candidates were selected for functional evaluation by heterologous production in Nicotiana benthamiana . Of these six candidates, three produced rare or previously inaccessible triterpene stereoisomers, namely, (3 S ,13 S )-malabarica-17,21-diene-3β,14-diol, 19- epi -lupeol, and a previously unknown hopanoid stereoisomer that we call protostahopenol. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed key residues important for catalytic activity. The sequence similarity network mining strategy employed here will facilitate the targeted discovery of enzymes with unusual activity in higher organisms, which are not amenable to common genome mining approaches. More importantly, our work expands the accessible stereochemical space of triterpenes and represents the first step to the development of new triterpenoid-derived drugs.},

  abstract     = {An accelerated development of durable and affordable sustainable energy technologies is often hindered by a limited understanding of how nonprecious materials within these systems degrade. In acidic proton exchange membrane fuel cells and water electrolyzers, metallic cobalt (Co) is considered an unstable component that is often combined with precious metals or other stabilizers. To understand the mechanisms behind Co instability, we employ an experimental platform that quantifies dissolution with on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and product formation with electrochemical mass spectrometry during electrochemical testing, along with ex situ characterization. Under varied conditions (electrocatalysis, time, gas-type saturation, and ion concentration), windows of Co stability are observed that are different than predicted with classical chemical thermodynamics, suggesting new stabilization and degradation mechanisms than previously understood. Notably, Co is active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with prolonged stability that is ∼300 mV greater than thermodynamically projected. Additionally, in an oxygenated environment, Co concurrently performs the HER and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) yet undergoes different morphology changes and dissolution mechanisms. Interestingly, at open-circuit voltage, there is a 22× decrease in dissolution in an oxygen-free environment, proposing a route to decrease Co losses during device shutdown protocols. Lastly, under more extreme operating conditions, Co becomes stable after a substantial amount of dissolution, suggesting that high concentrations of Co 2+ ions in the microenvironment induce the formation of a stable CoHO 2 surface. Altogether, these results can be leveraged to improve the design and development of more robust and cost-effective sustainable energy technologies, as well as promote strategic strategies for prolonged material utilization.},

Under optimized conditions, we achieve a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 34% for methylformamide synthesis in a neutral NaClO 4 electrolyte. Mechanistic insights from in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and complementary synthetic experiments reveal two distinct reaction pathways: the direct oxidation of a hemiaminal intermediate and a novel route involving the formation of methylisocyanide, which subsequently hydrates to yield methylformamide. The presence of methylisocyanide was confirmed through mass spectrometry analysis following a successful Ugi multicomponent reaction, demonstrating the ability to safely utilize reactive intermediates within an electrochemical framework. This work underscores the potential of electrosynthesis to unlock metal-free, sustainable pathways to produce value-added nitrogen-containing compounds, paving the way for greener approaches in chemical manufacturing and catalysis.},

  abstract     = {We report that the cationic iridium complex ( iPr PCP)IrH + catalyzes the transfer-dehydrogenation of alkanes to give alkenes and hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of alkanes and arenes. Contrary to established selectivity trends found for C–H activation by transition metal complexes, strained cycloalkanes, including cyclopentane, cycloheptane, and cyclooctane, undergo C–H addition much more readily than n -alkanes, which in turn are much more reactive than cyclohexane. Aromatic C–H bonds also undergo H/D exchange much less rapidly than those of the strained cycloalkanes, but much more favorably than cyclohexane. The order of reactivity toward dehydrogenation correlates qualitatively with the reaction thermodynamics, but the magnitude is much greater than can be explained by thermodynamics. Accordingly, the cycloalkenes corresponding to the strained cycloalkanes undergo hydrogenation much more readily than cyclohexene, despite the less favorable thermodynamics of such hydrogenations. Computational (DFT) studies allow rationalization of the origin of reactivity and the unusual selectivity. Specifically, the initial C–H addition is strongly assisted by β-agostic interactions, which are particularly favorable for the strained cycloalkanes. Subsequent to α-C–H addition, the H atom of the β-agostic C–H bond is transferred directly to the hydride ligand of ( iPr PCP)IrH + to give a dihydrogen ligand. The overall processes, C–H addition and β-H-transfer to hydride, are calculated to generally have minima on the IRC surface although not necessarily on the enthalpy or free energy surfaces; these minima are extremely shallow such that the 1,2-dehydrogenations are effectively concerted although asynchronous.},

  abstract     = {Developing active, stable, and cost-effective acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is a critical challenge in realizing large-scale hydrogen (H 2 ) production via electrochemical water splitting. Utilizing highly active and relatively inexpensive Ru is generally challenged by its long-term durability issue. Here, we explore the potential of stabilizing active Ru sites in Ru x (Ir,Fe,Co,Ni) 1– x multicomponent alloy by investigating its phase formation behavior, OER performance, and OER-induced surface reconstruction. The alloy exhibited a multiphase structure composed of major face-centered cubic (fcc) and minor hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phases at near equimolar concentration. Machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) coupled with replica-exchange molecular dynamics was utilized to describe the atomic scale mixing behavior of the Ru x (Ir,Fe,Co,Ni) 1– x catalysts and other RuIr-based alloys. The model supports our experimental findings of the well-mixed bulk fcc phase and provides an indication of the minor hcp phase formation. The optimized Ru 0.20 (Ir,Fe,Co,Ni) 0.80 catalyst exhibited improved OER activity with an average overpotential of ∼237 mV measured at 10 mA cm –2 and enhanced stability with a low activity degradation rate of ∼1.1 mV h –1 in 24 h of operation. The acidic OER conditions induced the formation of a thin RuIr-rich oxide shell layer with a trace amount of 3d metals, where Ru was found to be relatively stabilized near the surface of the evolved nanoparticles. The machine learning-accelerated high throughput simulation protocol was further employed to screen other potential RuIr-containing quinary alloys based on expected phase stability. This work highlights the opportunity of stabilizing Ru in a multicomponent alloy matrix with improved activity and stability.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the formation overpotential of key reaction intermediates represents a major challenge in developing broad electrocatalytic reactions. Recent vibrational spectroscopic studies of electrochemical CO 2 or CO reduction reaction (CO (2) RR) characterized an interesting formation of stochastic CO (CO stochastic ) intermediate with negligible energy losses under certain circumstances. Yet, the precise formation conditions and mechanisms remain unclear, hindering the correct understanding of related spectroscopic results and utilization of these effects to develop the CO (2) RR and other electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, we combine in situ attenuated total reflection infrared absorption (ATR-IR) and Raman spectroscopies to systematically study the origins and generation mechanisms of these CO stochastic . We reveal for the first time that the CO stochastic originates from plasmonic excitation of Cu by laser excitation and exists only in in situ Raman but not in ATR-IR measurements utilizing the exact same catalysts and electrochemical cell. Both the illumination wavelength and the fluence are important for the formation of CO stochastic . Furthermore, the surface speciation of the catalyst, i.e., the copresence of mixed metallic Cu 0 and Cu + states, is discovered to be crucial for the formation of CO stochastic . These results demonstrate that mechanistic studies of the CO (2) RR and other electrocatalytic reactions utilizing in situ Raman spectroscopy must carefully control the excitation fluence to avoid signals due to plasmonic excitations of the catalysts other than the electrochemical processes. Meanwhile, plasmon-enhanced electrochemistry, although still impractical for promoting CO 2 RR under ordinary illumination, may inspire new strategies for designing light-driven electrochemical reactions at extremely low overpotentials.},

Herein, we molecularly engineered a de novo substrate-free SICTERS small molecule, namely BTT–TPA (bis-thienyl-substituted benzotriazole selenadiazole derivative structures), possessing both ultrasensitive Raman signals and excellent photothermal effects based on self-stacking. The mechanistic studies confirm that BTT maintains the planar structure with polycyclic distorted vibrations required for SICTERS. TPA enhances the donor–acceptor interaction, yielding a Raman sensitivity of BTT higher than previously reported SICTERS molecules; it also acts as a molecular rotor, increasing the photothermal conversion efficiency to 67.44%, which is superior to most of the existing SERS-based photothermal materials. In the tumor model of mouse orthotopic colon cancer, BTT–TPA NPs demonstrate a great Raman imaging-guided photothermal therapy effect in eliminating primary and metastatic tumors, remarkably decreasing the recurrence rate.

Compared to groups IV and III–V semiconductors, hybrid perovskites (HPs) are an emergent class of semiconductor materials with remarkable solution processability and compositional variability that have facilitated rapid experimentation to achieve new properties and progress toward efficient devices, particularly for solar cells. Surprisingly, vapor deposition techniques for HPs are substantially less developed, despite the complementary benefits that have secured vapor methods as workhorse tools for semiconductor fabrication. For instance, metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) emerged in the late 1960s as a vital tool to enable production of compound semiconductor and heterojunction devices, giving rise to tremendously important technologies such as solid-state lighting and diode lasers, yet there is no analogous MOCVD process for HPs. Here, using a custom-built two-zone reactor, we report the first MOCVD process for the direct vapor deposition of thick and continuous films of methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX 3 ; X = Br, I) from distinct organolead, halide, and amine vapor sources. Mechanistic investigation via kinetic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a multistep reaction mechanism that should be generalizable to a broad set of HP materials. We anticipate that the continued development of generic HP MOCVD processes will unlock compositional, crystallographic, and morphological control complementary to solution methods, enabling the rational design of material properties and pursuit of new applications.},

We found that FAPbI 3 exhibits 10× higher solubility in 30% 2ME in GBL than in 2ME alone and 40% higher solubility than in GBL alone at 90 °C. This enhanced solubility is attributed to the disruption of the hydrogen bonding network within 2ME, allowing its hydroxyl and ether groups to interact more freely with the solute. Leveraging this phenomenon, we grew phase-stable α-FAPbI 3 thin single crystals under ambient air conditions with no doping. Compared to conventional cesium-doped FAPbI 3 , the undoped FAPbI 3 single-crystal films exhibited lower defect densities and enhanced charge retention and transfer while also avoiding phase segregation linked to cesium incorporation. Solar cells fabricated with these ambient-air-grown single-crystal films achieved an efficiency of 21.56% (17.72% for cesium-doped FAPbI 3 ), retaining 90% of performance after six months of storage. These findings advance our understanding of perovskite solubility in solvent blends and offer an efficient pathway for producing stable, high-efficiency FAPbI 3 single-crystal solar cells through ambient air fabrication, overcoming the limitations of doping.},

Inhibition of MAGL offers unique advantages over the direct activation of cannabinoid receptors in treating cancer, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory diseases. Although specific fluorescent molecular imaging probes are commonly used for the real-time analysis of the localization and distribution of drug targets in cells, they are almost invariably composed of a linker connecting the pharmacophore with a large fluorophore. In this study, we have developed miniaturized fluorescent probes targeting MAGL by incorporating a highly fluorescent boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moiety into the inhibitor structure that interacts with the MAGL active site. These miniaturized fluorescent probes exhibit favorable drug-like properties such as high solubility and permeability, picomolar potency for MAGL across various species, and high cell selectivity and specificity. A range of translational investigations were conducted, including cell-free fluorescence polarization assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and confocal fluorescence microscopy of live cancer cells, live primary neurons, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids. Furthermore, the application of red-shifted analogs or 18 F positron emission labeling illustrated the significant versatility and adaptability of the fluorescent ligands in various experimental contexts.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the role of phosphorylation in the liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of tau, the underlying driving forces, and the potential implications of this separation on protein conformation and subsequent protein aggregation were investigated. We compared in vivo-produced phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and nonphosphorylated tau under different coacervation conditions without adding crowding agents. Our findings revealed that spontaneous phase separation occurs exclusively in p-tau, triggered by a temperature shift from 4 °C to room temperature, and is driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The p-tau self-acervation is reversible with temperature changes. Native mass spectrometry detects only two to nine phosphate groups per p-tau molecule, highlighting the impact of phosphorylation on tau’s structural flexibility. Cross-linking mass spectrometry showed fewer long-range contacts in p-tau, suggesting a looser conformation induced by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-induced LLPS and RNA-induced LLPS occurred at different timeframes. However, neither tau nor p-tau formed fibrils without the addition of dextran sulfate or RNA as inducers. Using human kidney epithelial cells expressing the tau R domain fused with fluorescent proteins as reporter cells, we observed aggregates in the nuclear envelope (NE) only in the cells treated with LLPS-state p-tau, which correlates with NE occurrences reported in Alzheimer’s disease brain sections. These findings provide deeper insights into the impact of phosphorylation on tau aggregation through an intermediate condensation phase, offering novel perspectives on neurodegenerative disease mechanisms.},

Previous research has shown that structural factors, in particular, site disorder between the sulfide and halide anions, can impact the ionic conductivity of lithium argyrodites. One current hypothesis for this correlation between anion site disorder and ionic transport is a connection to the lithium-ion substructure. However, as there is limited research surrounding the anion disordering process itself, this relationship has yet to be fully understood. This research explores the impact of the composition and synthesis on the anion disordering process through the Li 6+ x P 1– x Si x S 5 Br ( x = 0 to 0.4 in 0.1 steps) series of substitutions quenched from different annealing temperatures. Ex situ and in situ diffraction studies show that the anion site disorder within the compounds increases upon Si introduction only for samples quenched from higher annealing temperatures but remains relatively constant at lower annealing temperatures. Based on in situ diffraction measurements, we further monitor the effects of anion mobility at elevated temperatures allowing inference of slower anion disordering kinetics with changing compositional content. We complement the experimental work using nudged-elastic band calculations showing the overall preference of anions for their specific sites and the possibility of anion mobility. This work provides insight into the argyrodites and shows that the anion disordering can be monitored and that the composition has strong influences on the disordering process.},

This is largely due to the poor nucleophilicity and resistance to chemical oxidation of arginine. Drawing inspiration from the metal catalyzed oxidation (MCO) processes of arginine, we introduce a chemical methodology aimed at generating glutamate-5-semialdehyde from arginine residues within peptides and proteins. This innovative chemical approach capitalizes on the inherent weak nucleophilicity and oxidative properties of arginine. We also demonstrate the application of this strategy to selectively introduce both natural and unnatural post-translational modifications (PTMs) in a targeted manner. Our chemical approach offers a rapid, robust, and highly selective technique, facilitating chemoproteomic profiling of arginine sites prone to forming glutamate-5-semialdehyde PTM within the human proteome. Additionally, this methodology serves as a versatile platform for uncovering microenvironments that are susceptible to undergoing arginine carbonylation PTM, enabling the understanding of the effect of oxidative stress on arginine in proteins and the impact of these PTMs on cellular processes.},

  abstract     = {The activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a complex multibody multievent process involving agonist binding, receptor activation, G protein coupling, and subsequent G protein activation. The order and energetics of these events, though crucial for the rational design of selective GPCR drugs, are challenging to characterize and remain largely underexplored. Here, we employed molecular dynamics simulations and our recently developed traveling salesman-based automated path searching (TAPS) algorithm to efficiently locate the minimum free-energy paths for the coupling events of the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) with its endogenous ligand CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) and Gi protein. We show that, after overcoming three low energy barriers (3.24–6.89 kcal/mol), Gi alone can precouple with CXCR4 even without CXCL12, consistent with previous reports on the existence of the apo CXCR4-Gi complex and our NanoBiT experiments. The highest barrier of 6.89 kcal/mol in this process corresponds to the packing of the proline–isoleucine–phenylalanine (PIF) motif of CXCR4. Interestingly, without Gi, CXCL12 alone cannot activate CXCR4 (high barrier of 18.89 kcal/mol). Instead, it can enhance Gi coupling by circumventing the energy barrier of PIF packing. Shedding new light on the activation mechanism of CXCR4, these results present TAPS as a promising tool for uncovering complete activation pathways of GPCRs and the corresponding agonist design.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical nitroarene reduction enables the green production of anilines at ambient conditions thanks to the manipulated transfer of multiple electrons and protons via controlling potentials and currents, but challenges remain in pH-neutral electrolysis using nonprecious catalysts. Here, Chevrel phase Mo 6 S 8 with high conductivity and insertable frameworks is proposed for the first time as a cost-efficient candidate with prominent performance and, more importantly, as a new platform to unravel cation effects on nitroarene electroreduction. Nanosized Mo 6 S 8 derived from polymer-confined sulfidation affords a high yield (∼95%) and Faradaic efficiency (∼99%) for reducing 4-nitrostyrene to 4-aminostyrene at −0.45 V (vs RHE) in 0.1 M LiClO 4 , outperforming a series of counterparts of metal sulfides and even noble metals. The combination of experimental and theoretical analyses identifies an intercalation-correlated cation effect, expanding the current knowledge limited to the outer Helmholtz plane of electrodes. In situ Li + intercalation into Mo 6 S 8 cavities during electrolysis ameliorates the electronic configurations and thereby promotes the adsorption of the nitro group on low-coordinated Mo sites for hydrogenation via a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the efficient electrosynthesis of aniline derivatives with conserved reducing groups from a wide range of substrates highlights the promise of Mo 6 S 8 for electrochemical refinery.},

  abstract     = {Asymmetric organocatalysis by bifunctional acid- and base-type small organic molecules has emerged as a promising way to enhance stereoselective organic transformations since the beginning of this millennium. Takemoto’s tert -amine/thiourea catalyst, an archetype in these endeavors, has encouraged many to design new multifunctional alternatives. However, the discovery of efficient catalysts in a library of thousands of candidates containing the desired functionalities in their structures remains a great challenge both synthetically and computationally. We, toward these ends, developed a computational protocol (CIPOC─Computational Identification of POtential (Organo)Catalysts), which discovered a chiral 2-aminoDMAP/urea catalyst among 1600 multifunctional catalyst candidates enabling conjugate addition of malonates to trans -β-nitroalkenes rapidly (in a few hours) with exquisite selectivities and yields, producing superior results than that of Takemoto’s. The unique activity of this chiral 2-aminoDMAP/urea is attributed to the dual function of the 2-aminoDMAP unit (double H-bonding and π-stacking interactions) in addition to the exceptional performance of the urea unit compared to thiourea, as a result of a lower energetic penalty required to distort the catalyst to its active conformation to provide optimal catalytic interactions.},

Coronoid synthesis has long been considered difficult due to the cyclization of nanographene. It becomes an immense challenge to synthesize open-shell coronoids since radicals appear only when the macrocycle size exceeds a critical value. Here we present an open-shell coronoid with six radicals achieved through an on-surface synthesis. This spin coronoid displays a collective spin state arising from both the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction and the next-nearest-neighbor exchange interaction of six unpaired π electrons along the conjugation pathways. The characterization of the spin excitation from the ground state to the excited state was carried out by using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. Additionally, we show that the spin coronoid can be utilized as a nanoscale platform to achieve short antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains through tip manipulation. Our findings present a design strategy for creating coronoids with polyradicals, which could provide inspiration for fabrication of open-shell coronoid or cyclic spintronic systems.},
