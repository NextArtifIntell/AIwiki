  abstract     = {Uridine (rU) and 2′-deoxyuridine (dU) are common DNA lesions. dU is repaired through a base excision repair (BER) pathway initiated by uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), while rU is typically removed from DNA via ribonucleotide excision repair, mediated by RNase H2. In this study, we report that rU is also repaired through the UDG-mediated BER pathway. We found that UDG catalyzes the removal of uracil from rU embedded in DNA, but exhibits no activity toward rU in RNA. Biochemical and crystallographic analyses revealed that the 2′–OH group of rU is effectively accommodated by UDG and directly participates in catalyzing the hydrolysis of the N -glycosidic bond. The abasic site product generated upon removal of uracil from rU by UDG is further processed by downstream BER enzymes to restore undamaged DNA. Our findings suggest that UDG-initiated BER constitutes a previously unrecognized pathway for the repair of rU-specific ribonucleotides. Additionally, we developed a method for selectively quantifying rU content in DNA. Using this method, we determined that rU repair by UDG is not a major pathway in human cells. This discovery expands our understanding of the diverse biological functions of UDG, and inspires further investigation to determine the role of its rU-removal in cells.},

The present work shows syntheses, structures, and applications of amorphous graphene and GO analogues alternative to the ideal ones. The simultaneous multiple reactions of two conjugated monomers provide amorphous conjugated polymer networks containing low-crystalline graphitic domains and their stacking. The stacked amorphous graphene and GO are exfoliated into thin nanosheets including few-layers and monolayers. Moreover, in situ syntheses of the amorphous GO analogues are applied to obtain a reinforced plastic with high mechanical strength.

Cochliodone A exerts antimalarial and antimycobacterial activities in addition to being cytotoxic against KB, BC1, and NCI-H187 human cancer cell lines. The potential of cochliodone A and its analogues as effective therapeutics against cancer, tuberculosis, and malaria, together with its complex dimeric chemical structure, are reasons enough for continued investigation. Here, sequence analyses of the open reading frames found in the previously identified cochliodone A biosynthetic gene cluster, together with a series of gene-knockout experiments, heterologous in vivo production of pathway intermediates in Aspergillus nidulans and in vitro assays of key enzymes allowed us to propose a biosynthetic pathway and detailed mechanisms leading to the production of cochliodones. In addition, we identified that the elimination of the dimerizing multicopper oxidase CcdJ from the ccd pathway led to pathway crosstalk between the ccd pathway and an unrelated benzaldehyde-producing biosynthetic pathway formation to generate new secondary metabolites. Most interestingly, however, through the in vitro study, we established that the sequential actions of an acetyltransferase, an acetate lyase, and an enoyl reductase achieve a full reduction of the unsaturated backbone of the polyketide (PKs) product generated by the nonreducing polyketide synthase (PKS) CcdL. This alternative mode of reducing a polyketomethylene chain could be engineered further to develop a facile chemoenzymatic modification of the polyketide backbone saturation level postpolyketide synthesis in trans .},

  abstract     = {Inorganic semiconductors are composed of heavy elements whose vibrational motions are well described by classical mechanics. Heavy elements, such as Pb and I, support charge carriers in metal halide perovskites. Nevertheless, the soft structure and strong coupling between the organic and inorganic components create conditions in which nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can play important roles. By combining ab initio, ring-polymer, and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics approaches with time-domain density functional theory, we demonstrate how NQEs influence structural and electronic properties and electron-vibrational dynamics in hybrid organic–inorganic (MAPbI 3 ) and all-inorganic (CsPbI 3 ) perovskites. Quantum zero-point fluctuations enhance structural disorder, reduce the band gap, and accelerate elastic electron-vibrational scattering responsible for coherence loss. NQEs have opposite influences on intraband carrier relaxation and interband recombination. These inelastic scattering events are governed by the product of the overlap-like electron–phonon matrix element and atomic velocity. NQEs reduce the overlap and increases the velocity. The intraband carrier relaxation involves many states. Reduction of overlap between some states is offset by other pathways, while an increased velocity makes intraband relaxation faster. Electron–hole overlap in band-edge states plays a key role in the recombination, and its reduction by NQEs-enhanced disorder makes the recombination slower. This phenomenon is seen with both MAPbI 3 and CsPbI 3 and is much more pronounced when a light organic component is present. This study offers a detailed understanding of the role of NQEs in the carrier relaxation processes of perovskites, offering important theoretical insights into hot carriers and carrier recombination that govern the performance of solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.},

Büchner reaction is a unique type of expansive skeletal editing that transforms benzenoids into functionalized cycloheptatrienes. However, due to challenges in compatibility and selectivity, achieving seamless integration of this reaction with dearomative cycloaddition within a unified system remains undeveloped. Here, we demonstrated an energy-transfer-induced intermolecular dearomative skeletal editing reaction of benzenoids with a range of electronically diverse alkynes. This protocol employed N -acylimines as diradical precursors to efficiently construct various structurally diverse polycyclic frameworks in high chemo-, regio-, and diastereoselectivities that have been previously inaccessible. The challenges related to general reactivity and selectivity issues were circumvented through the smooth merging of photoinduced skeletal editing with dearomative cycloaddition. Experimental and computational studies were performed to support the diradical mechanism and interpret the origins of the observed chemo-, regio-, and diastereoselectivities.},

  abstract     = {We describe an in situ -polymerized conformal thin layer coating of narrow band gap carbon-rich carbon nitride (NBG-CRCN) on titania nanorod arrays to design a binary semiconductor heterojunction photocatalyst. The in situ polymerization creates a strong interaction between the TiO 2 nanorod substrate and the carbon nitride film, which prevents leaching of CRCN in liquid electrolytes. A unique aspect of our work is developing an easy and inexpensive technique for the heteroepitaxial growth of mechanically and photochemically stable carbon nitride thin films with intimate contact at the CN:TNR heterojunction interface. This method aids in overcoming one of the main problems with carbon nitride (CN), namely, the inability to produce an evenly distributed CN coating on a substrate. The synthesized NBG-CRCN@TNR extends the visible light absorption to 700 nm (E g = 1.7 eV) and red-shifts the photoluminescence (PL) emission peak to 580 nm. The peak shifts and broadening in the Raman spectra of the NBG-CRCN@TNR hybrid compared to those in TNR confirm an unusually strong interaction between TiO 2 and NBG-CRCN. An easy and inexpensive technique to heteroepitaxially grow CRCN (002) on rutile TiO 2 (110) is confirmed by advanced characterization. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) suggest the heteroepitaxial growth of (002) CRCN on rutile TiO 2 (110). Under AM1.5G solar illumination, the NBG-CRCN@TNR hybrid shows superior performance in photoelectrochemical water splitting, generating a photocurrent density as high as 4.3 mA cm –2 in 1 M KOH under 0.6 V external bias, rising to 8.4 mA cm –2 in the presence of a hole scavenger (methanol). An impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 26.51 μmol h –1 with 88.12% Faradaic efficiency is recorded. Establishing a high-quality interface between g-C 3 N 4 and titania permits effective charge carrier separation, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous-S batteries (ASBs) are emerging as promising energy storage technologies due to their high safety, low cost, and high theoretical energy density. However, the present understanding of sulfur evolution in water relies on experience derived from conventional organic electrolyte-based sulfur batteries (OSBs). The gap between ASB and OSB has impeded progress in advancing the rational design of sulfur catalysts in the aqueous phase. Herein, we reveal the unique interaction between H 2 O and S species, which is fundamentally distinguishable from the organic counterparts. A series of spectroscopy analyses discloses that elemental sulfur is initially reduced to polysulfides (mainly S 4 2– ), which subsequently react with H 2 O to generate HS – , involving both polysulfide conversion and the Volmer step of water dissociation. Combined electrochemical and computational analysis further proposes an aqueous-S catalyst selection metric based on simultaneous polysulfide adsorption and Volmer-step catalysis. As a proof of concept, we have successfully prioritized the Mo 2 C-catalyzed ASBs with a superior rate capability of 1040 mAh g –1 than the Fe 3 C (693 mAh g –1 ) and pure C (510 mAh g –1 ) at a high current density of 5 A g –1 .

Leveraging the real-time, label-free detection capability of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, a molecularly responsive hydrogel film is introduced to enhance small molecule sensitivity. This advanced biosensing platform utilizes split-aptamer-cross-linked hydrogels (aptagels) engineered using 8-arm poly(ethylene glycol) macromers, capable of directly and reversibly detecting vancomycin. Investigation through SPR and optical waveguide mode, along with quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring, reveals that the reversible formation of analyte-induced ternary molecular complexes leads to aptagel contraction and significant refractive index changes. Optimization of aptamer cross-link distribution and complementarity of split-aptamer pairs maximizes conformational changes of the aptagel, demonstrating a detection limit of 160–250 nM for vancomycin (6–9 fold improvement over monolayer counterpart) with a broad linear sensing range up to 1 mM. The aptagel maintains stability over 24 h in blood serum and 5 weeks in diluted blood plasma (mimicking interstitial fluid). This structurally responsive aptagel platform with superior stability and sensitivity offers promising avenues for continuous in vivo monitoring of small molecules.},

  abstract     = {Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a pivotal role in cell signaling through their activation via dimerization. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the temporal dynamics of RTK activity and downstream signals, such as ERK, in determining the cell fate. To better understand these dynamics, it is essential to develop methods capable of controlling the RTK activity with high temporal resolution. However, techniques for precisely modulating the activity of endogenous RTKs without requiring genetic modification remain insufficiently established. In this study, we developed a DNA aptamer agonist, Met-azo-aptamer, which enables reversible optical control of the activity of the c-Met receptor, a member of the RTK family. This was achieved by incorporating azobenzene, a photoisomerizable molecule, into a DNA aptamer that binds to c-Met. This design allows light-induced switching between the active and inactive structures of the aptamer. When the aptamer was applied to HeLa cells and exposed to ultraviolet or blue light, phosphorylation signals within the cells were activated in response to the light patterns. Furthermore, by variation of the light patterns, the Met-azo-aptamer successfully controlled the timing, amplitude, and duration of downstream ERK activation. The Met-azo-aptamer developed in this study offers a high-resolution method for investigating the relationship between RTK activation patterns and cell function or fate.},

Herein, by assigning the activity and selectivity requirements to two independent single-atom sites, we deliberately engineered a Co–Zn DAC for promising H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis, from which the Co sites provided the activity response for oxygen reduction, and the Zn sites regulated the reaction selectivity toward the 2e – pathway. Through multidimensional in situ characterizations, a potential-dependent switching function of the Zn sites was revealed, which made the increase in H 2 O 2 production at various reaction stages controllable. As a result, efficient H 2 O 2 selectivity switching from 11.1% in the single Co atom catalyst to 94.8% in the Co–Zn DAC was realized, with a prominent turnover frequency of 2.7 s –1 among the reported H 2 O 2 -producing catalysts. Notably, a similar effect was also observed in M–Zn DACs (M = Pt, Ru, or Ni), which demonstrated the universal switcher role of the Zn sites. The real-time catalytic site behavior insights gained through this integrated experimental and theoretical study are envisioned to be valuable not only for the ORR but also for other energy catalysis reactions involving activity–selectivity trade-off issues.},

  abstract     = {Imide-based chlorinating reagents are mild and easy to use yet can lack the reactivity of charged chlorenium-ion donors. Here, we present a simple strategy for increasing the reactivity of these neutral chlorinating species by encapsulation inside a cationic coordination cage. Using this approach, we demonstrate that two different-sized Pd 2 L 4 cages can catalyze chlorolactonization and chlorocycloetherification reactions of acid and alcohol functionalized α and β-substituted styrene substrates with either 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DCDMH) or N -chlorosuccinimide (NCS) as the chlorenium sources. A kinetic study shows that the cages are proficient catalysts with a significant acceleration up to 10 5 . However, an unexpected dichotomy is revealed wherein the smaller cage, which is best preorganized to bind and nominally provide maximum activation of the imide reagent, shows an order of magnitude less acceleration than the larger cage that has apparently mismatched host–guest chemistry. When the scope of reactions is further extended to the chlorination of simple, unfunctionalized α-methylstyrene, the same pattern of cage reactivity is observed, suggesting that differences are not explained by coencapsulation. Computational studies indicate that the trend in reactivity is caused by the transition state being less fixed in the larger cage, allowing it to find optimal binding and thereby generate stronger interactions. This investigation highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of cage reactivity to design new noncovalent catalysts for a greater range of transformations.},

  abstract     = {InP-based quantum dots (QDs) represent the major commercial success of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). A combination of the robust, mostly covalent, structure and nontoxic nature of the constituent elements makes them a QD material of choice for display and LED technologies. Despite successful commercial realization, InP NCs still lack synthetic versatility and robustness, seen, for instance, as a continued quest to substitute a commonly used pyrophoric and expensive tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine precursor. Herein, we propose solid-state, nonpyrophoric, and synthetically readily accessible acylphosphines as convenient phosphorus precursors for the synthesis of InP NCs. When combined with suitable anionic nucleophiles, such as arylthiolates, both tris(acyl)phosphines and indium complexes of bis(acyl)phosphines act as efficient sources of the P 3– anion, as corroborated by NMR spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction studies. This type of reactivity is utilized in colloidal synthesis of uniform InP QDs with well-defined excitonic features in their optical absorption spectra, spanning 460–600 nm. The conversion kinetics and therefore the final NC size are controlled by the nature of acyl substituents and by the use of either indium or zinc long-chain carboxylates as ligands. The proposed acylpnictide route is anticipated to foster the development of other metal phosphide and metal arsenide NCs.},

  abstract     = {The development of efficient and practical N -dealkylation reactions stands as a longstanding objective in synthetic chemistry. Inspired by the oxidative N -dealkylation reactions mediated by heme and nonheme metalloenzymes, we disclose a biomimetic oxidative N -dealkylation catalysis that utilizes a nonheme manganese complex bearing anthryl-appended aminopyridine ligand and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) as the terminal oxidant. A variety of Weinreb amides and cyclic aliphatic amines are efficiently transformed into valuable methyl hydroxamates and ω-amino acids through oxidative C–N bond cleavage. Mechanistic studies, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal that a manganese(IV)-oxo aminopyridine cation radical species, which is formed via the bromoacetic acid-assisted heterolytic O–O bond cleavage of a presumed manganese(III)-hydroperoxo aminopyridine species and the subsequent intramolecular electron transfer (ET) from the anthryl group of the aminopyridine ligand to the manganese center, is the active intermediate that initiates the oxidative N -dealkylation reactions; this process is reminiscent to the heterolytic O–O bond cleavage of iron(III)-hydroperoxo porphyrin intermediates (Cpd 0) to form iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin π-cation radicals (Cpd I) that are responsible for diverse selective oxidation reactions. Moreover, it is revealed that the oxidative activation of the C–H bond adjacent to the nitrogen atom proceeds via a hydride transfer (HT) mechanism, which involves a concerted asynchronous proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), followed by an ET process. Thus, this study reports the first instance of catalytic oxidative N -dealkylation of a variety of tertiary amides, such as Weinreb amides and cyclic aliphatic amines, mediated by a Cpd I-like nonheme manganese(IV)-oxo aminopyridine cation radical species via an initial HT pathway.},

  abstract     = {Formycin A and pyrazofurin are two naturally occurring pyrazole-derived C -nucleosides with antibacterial and antiviral activities. While earlier studies have established the chemistry of C -glycosidic bond formation as well as the subsequent steps in the biosynthesis of formycin A and pyrazofurin, how the pyrazole ring itself is constructed remains elusive. While N–N bond formation in the pyrazole ring was previously reported to involve coupling of N 6 -hydroxylated l -lysine and l -glutamic acid catalyzed by the hydrazine synthetase PyfG, herein PyfG and its homologue ForJ are shown instead to recognize d -glutamate instead of l -glutamate. The hydrazine product of ForJ/PyfG catalysis then releases α-hydrazino d -glutamic acid upon processing by the NAD-dependent oxidoreductase ForL. Furthermore, N -acylation of α-hydrazino d -glutamate with an amino acid catalyzed by the ATP-grasp ligase ForM/PyfJ is indispensable for recognition by the FAD-dependent oxidoreductase ForR/PyfK to perform dehydrogenation of the Cα–N bond and thereby form a hydrazone intermediate. This work not only demonstrates that d -glutamic acid is the correct substrate for hydrazine biosynthesis but also reveals a cryptic N -acylation step in the assembly of the pyrazole core. These results thus provide significant insights into the biosynthesis of pyrazole rings that are rarely seen in natural products.},

Photocatalytic generation of a difluoroacetyl radical followed by carbon–carbon bond formation results in a prochiral carbon-centered radical that engages with the chiral catalyst. A trialkylamine reductant is proposed to turn over the catalyst in this net-reductive transformation. Notably, incorporating an ( S )-β-methyl-substituted cysteine as the N -terminal residue improved selectivity relative to that of the native N -terminal cysteine (Cys) residue, and X-ray crystallographic analysis supports the conformational underpinning of this effect. A range of enantioenriched γ-substituted amides were synthesized in up to a 96:4 enantiomeric ratio, demonstrating the broad functional group tolerance of this method.

  abstract     = {Increasing the connectivity of structural units presents a potentially valuable approach to improve hydrolytic stability in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). We herein leverage this strategy by synthesizing the first tritopic benzotriazolate MOF, Zn 5 (OAc) 4 (TBTT) 2 (H 3 TBTT = 2,4,6-tris(1 H -benzo[ d ][1,2,3]triazol-5-yl)-1,3,5-triazine), which exhibits open metal sites, high connectivity, high porosity, and significant water uptake capacity. The MOF adopts a previously unknown topology with (3,6,6)-connectivity, which is supported by single-crystal electron diffraction and elemental analysis. The framework undergoes postsynthetic metal and anion exchange with NiCl 2 , which increases the accessible pore volume and the net hydrophilicity of the framework. With this exchange, the apparent BET surface area increases from 1994 to 3034 m 2 /g, and the water uptake step shifts from 56 to 33% relative humidity (RH). The high gravimetric capacity of the Ni-rich MOF, 0.98 g/g, translates to a working capacity of 0.64 g/g during a pressure swing cycle between 20 and 40% RH at 25 °C. Combining this performance with a less than 2% loss in working capacity over 100 cycles, the new material rivals the best MOF water sorbents to date.},

However, some have argued that the droplet generation methods provided energy to the reactions, and the different interfaces that the droplets contact also played important roles; therefore, it is the droplet activation or the environment, not the intrinsic properties, that is responsible for the observed chemistry. In this study, we used adiabatic expansion and dry ice in water to generate homogeneous, contactless, supercooled, and unactivated microdroplets. A large variety of reactions were successfully tested. We opine that it is the intrinsic properties, and not droplet activation, that are responsible for microdroplet chemistry.},

This study investigates the phase transition of marcasite-type orthorhombic Ba 0.9 M 0.1 NCN carbodiimides, where a transformation to a CsCl-type tetragonal phase was observed at room temperature under hydrostatic pressure of 0.8 GPa (M = Ca) and 0.3 GPa (M = Sr). This transition, accompanied by an increase in the metal coordination under from 6 to 8, occurs at pressures significantly lower than those required for the high-pressure phase transitions of rock-salt-type metal halides and marcasite-type metal diantimonides. Remarkably, partial phase transitions were also induced by hand milling, a process that applies localized shear forces, distinct from the particle-crushing effects of high-energy ball milling. The transition mechanism, analyzed via variable-cell nudged elastic band (VCNEB) calculations, revealed that while the linear NCN 2– anions remain stable, the shear-sliding of Ba 2+ cations and the rotation of NCN 2– anions are critical to the structural transformation. These findings underscore the potential of hand milling to effectively induce phase transitions in compounds containing linear molecular anions, offering new strategies for predicting and controlling such transitions in similar materials.},

Recently, the role of dynamic restructuring of Pd regions at and near the nanoparticle surface in response to modulating gas (H 2 and O 2 ) concentrations was highlighted for controlling the surface Pd oxide stoichiometry. Here, we investigate the mechanism of formation and decomposition of Pd hydride (PdH x ) at and near the bimetallic nanoparticle surfaces, a key species for controlling the activity, selectivity, and stability of Pd catalysts in many hydrogenation reactions. We employ modulation excitation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (ME-XAS) to directly observe the time scale of PdH x formation and decomposition on the surface of Pd–Au nanoparticles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide additional insights into the stability and energetics of PdH x formation under varying H fractions and Pd substructures. Our results reveal a complex interplay between Pd ensemble size, surface structure, and hydrogen environment in determining the kinetics and thermodynamics of PdH x formation. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying surface PdH x formation and decomposition, the rational design of dynamic catalysts with controlled Pd hydride stoichiometries can become possible.},

  abstract     = {Carboxylate diradical intermediates, with α-carbon and carboxylic oxygen acting as reactive radical centers, represent a highly attractive and long-sought species in reaction design and synthesis. However, capturing these intermediates for diradical coupling reactions poses a formidable challenge due to their inherent instability and spontaneous decarboxylation. Here, we addressed this challenge by temporarily masking the carboxylate oxygen radical reactivity via a photocleavable dynamic oxygen–iodine bond. This approach effectively prevents unwanted decarboxylation and enables the controlled utilization of the carboxylate oxygen radical in forming new bonds. Carboxylates and alkenes/heteroarenes, among the most readily available raw materials, can now seamlessly couple via radical pathways to form γ-butyrolactones, which are common motifs found in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. Ionic reaction pathways via traditional intermediates of carboxylates are ruled out based on experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This strategy overcomes the substrate limitations of traditional methods, significantly expanding the range of applicable alkenes/heteroarenes. Our method allows transforming carboxylates and alkenes via new reaction modes to diverse products and offers new insights into developing di- and multiradical equivalents for unprecedented reactions and synthetic designs.},

The lanthanum complex 1 La is the first benzene tetra-anion complex of the largest rare-earth element. Aromaticity in the 10π-electron benzene ligands is confirmed through crystallographic studies of all compounds and nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations on 1 Y and 1 La . Analysis of the bonding in 1 Y and 1 La using density functional theory revealed strong covalency in the metal-benzene interactions, with very similar contributions from the metal 4d/5d orbitals, respectively, and the benzene π* orbitals. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on 1 Sm , 1 Gd , and 1 Dy are also consistent with the presence of a benzene tetra-anion ligand. The origins of the appreciable exchange coupling constant of J exch = −3.35 cm –1 (−2 J formalism) in 1 Gd are established through a computational study of the interacting magnetic orbitals. The dynamic magnetic properties of 1 Dy are also described. The clear absence of SMM behavior in the dysprosium complex is explained using multireference calculations and an ab initio ligand-field theory description of the 4f orbitals, which clearly show that the benzene tetra-anion ligand provides a dominant equatorial contribution.},

  abstract     = {Flexible organic crystals represent a novel class of smart materials that open many opportunities for optical applications. While it has been established that elastic or plastic deformation of slender molecular crystals can be commonly induced by external intervention, crystals that grow in bent or curled shapes naturally are rarely reported. This study introduces an extraordinarily flexible organic crystalline fibrous material, ( Z )-3-(2,3-dichloropyridin-4-yl)-2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)acrylonitrile (DPA), that crystallizes both as straight and curled crystals. Crystals of DPA are easily obtained from solution either as long fibers or as crystals that are curled to various extent, and sometimes even closed into a loop. The straight crystalline fibers can be bent mechanically by applying force or photochemically by exposure to ultraviolet light. The straight and curled crystals are both polar and capable of highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) with respective intensities of 2.03 ± 0.15 and 1.52 ± 0.12 times (equivalent strain ≈ 1%) that of urea. Curling during crystal growth provides direct access to curved SHG-active flexible organic optical waveguiding elements, such as crystalline optical ring resonators, thereby circumventing the necessity for manual crystal bending, which is usually not readily scalable. This work highlights the unconventional properties and capabilities that fibrous molecular crystalline materials bring to the global materials space and their potential applications as shape-conforming, nonlinear organic materials.},

  abstract     = {Cereblon E3 ligase modulatory drugs (CELMoDs) can be used to target proteins and mark them for proteasomal degradation by recruiting them to cereblon (CRBN), the substrate receptor of the CRL4 CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Modifications to the stereochemistry and regiochemistry of distal functionality on CELMoDs have been shown to have large effects on degradation activity and selectivity; however, methods allowing the rapid and selective introduction of enantioenriched moieties are rare. Herein, we report that classical CRBN-binding glutarimide cores can be successfully derivatized to aryl diazoacetates. These diazo derivatives, when in the presence of a dirhodium catalyst, successfully undergo high-yielding and highly enantioselective C–H functionalization of hydrocarbons and cyclopropanation of styrene. These products can be used to create not only molecular glue degrader-like compounds but also intermediates that can be elaborated into effective bifunctional ligand-directed degraders. Our findings highlight both the effectiveness of dirhodium catalysis in a drug discovery context and a new method for preparing diverse and stereoenriched glutarimide-containing compounds.},

  abstract     = {Systems that change properties upon exposure to chemical stimuli offer the interesting prospect of (partially) mimicking the functions of living systems. Over the past decade, numerous supramolecular systems whose chemical composition and properties are regulated by the dissipation of chemical fuels have been reported. These systems are typically based on the transient transformation of a “dormant” species into an active, self-assembling supramolecular monomer. The process is powered by fuel consumption and terminates upon fuel depletion, restoring the initial dormant state. Previously reported out-of-equilibrium supramolecular polymerizations relied on the activation of the dormant species by adding or removing small structural units to enable supramolecular polymerization. Here, we present an approach that combines the reversibility of dynamic covalent chemistry and supramolecular chemistry to trigger transient supramolecular polymerizations by “recycling” the components of a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL). Treatment of an equilibrated DCL of aliphatic imines and aromatic amines with an activated carboxylic acid (ACA) generates a dissipative dynamic combinatorial library of aromatic imines and protonated aliphatic amines. The transient acidic conditions enable the creation of a supramolecular polymer held together by interactions between the protonated aliphatic amines and the crown ether moieties embedded in the scaffold of the aromatic imines. Thus, fuel dissipation reshuffles the chemical connectivity and enables the temporary transformation of a purely covalent (polymeric) system into a supramolecular polymer. We demonstrate the strategy using two different covalent dormant feedstocks consisting of a diimine macrocycle involving a calix[4]arene scaffold and a distribution of imine (cyclo)oligomers derived from an isophthalaldehyde skeleton.},

In this study, we provide a synthetic route to an NHC-stabilized boryl radical cation as a salt of the weakly coordinating [Al(OR F ) 4 ] − ( R F = C(CF 3 ) 3 ) anion. The synthetic procedure was extended to dicationic diboron derivatives of Schlenk’s and Thiele’s hydrocarbons with meta - and para -phenylene coupling units between the spin centers. While most known isolable boron biradicals have a singlet ground-state with a thermally accessible triplet state, the boron version of Schlenk’s hydrocarbon occupies a ground-state triplet spin-state, as shown by combined electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory studies. Furthermore, initial reactivity studies of the dications with elemental sulfur and diphenyldiselenide are presented.},

The class-I photolyases have been well characterized through a direct electron-transfer (ET) tunneling mechanism with high repair quantum yield, but such a mechanism seemingly does not apply to all of the members in the diversified photolyase family. Here, using femtosecond spectroscopy, we show our systematic characterization of CPD repair by the class-II photolyases from Methanosarcina mazei and Drosophila melanogaster and reveal their complete photocycles with determination of reaction times of all ten elementary steps, including seven electron-transfer processes. We found that the initial electron injection bifurcates along two parallel routes, direct tunneling and two-step hopping. Unlike the class-I photolyases, the direct tunneling process here is significantly slower, occurring in several nanoseconds. This slow tunneling route leads to shifting of the branching yield toward the intrinsic two-step hopping pathway through the adenine intermediate. Throughout the photolyase family, the enzymes have adopted a unified bifurcating electron-transfer strategy as a universal repair mechanism through evolution.},

  abstract     = {Graphene nanoribbons (NRs) constitute a versatile platform for developing novel materials, where their structure governs their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties while also shaping their excited-state dynamics. Here, we investigate a set of three twisted N-doped molecular NRs of increasing length, obtained by linearly fusing perylene diimide to pyrene and pyrazino- or thiadiazolo-quinoxaline residues. By employing various temperature-dependent time-resolved spectroscopy techniques, we reveal how the flexible twisted NR geometry promotes the formation of a mixed electronic state with varying contributions from locally excited and charge-transfer (CT) states. The fate of this mixed state is highly sensitive to the molecular geometry, length, and solvent polarity. For the shortest NR, intersystem crossing dominates the deactivation pathway, efficiently generating triplets in low-polarity solvents. In contrast, for the extended NRs, intramolecular singlet fission (SF) takes place within a single nanoribbon. This is enabled by enhanced superexchange coupling due to a pronounced push–pull nature and the existence of multiple localized π-electron states caused by heteroatom doping, thereby circumventing the need for dimeric interactions typically associated with conventional SF systems. In higher-polarity environments, evidence of a (diabatic) CT state emerges. These findings underscore the intricate relationship between geometry, energy levels, and excited-state dynamics in twisted N-doped NRs.},

However, the development of ideal adsorbents with simultaneous high C 2 H 2 adsorption and selectivity remains a great challenge due to their very small molecular sizes and physical properties. Herein, we report a lithium(I)-chelation strategy for pore space partition (PSP) in a microporous MOF (Li + @NOTT-101-(COOH) 2 ) to achieve simultaneous high C 2 H 2 uptake and selectivity. The chelation model of Li + ions within the framework was visually identified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The immobilized Li + ions were found to have two functions: (1) partitioning large pore cages into smaller ones while maintaining high surface area and (2) providing specific binding sites to selectively take up C 2 H 2 over CO 2 . The resulting Li + @NOTT-101-(COOH) 2 exhibits a rare combination of a simultaneous high C 2 H 2 capture capacity (205 cm 3 g –1 ) and C 2 H 2 /CO 2 selectivity (13) at ambient conditions, far surpassing that of NOTT-101-(COOH) 2 (148 cm 3 g –1 and 3.8, respectively) and most top-tier materials reported. Theoretical calculations and gas-loaded SCXRD studies reveal that the chelated Li + ions combined with the segmented small cages can selectively bind with a large amount of C 2 H 2 through the unique π-complexation, accounting for the improved C 2 H 2 uptake and selectivity. Breakthrough experiments validated its excellent separation capacity for actual C 2 H 2 /CO 2 mixtures, providing one of the highest C 2 H 2 productivities of 118.9 L kg –1 (&gt;99.5% purity) in a single adsorption–desorption cycle.},

Emerging evidence has indicated that oxidative stress and reduced norepinephrine are key pathological features of depression. Herein, we constructed a smart organic small-molecule fluorescence-based therapeutic system (Cou-NE-H 2 O 2 ) for the diagnosis and treatment of depression targeted at restoring redox homeostasis and efficiently upregulating norepinephrine in the brain. Utilizing Cou-NE-H 2 O 2 , we could evaluate the depressive phenotype via the fluorescence monitoring of the redox state in mouse brains. By reducing hydrogen peroxide and continuously increasing norepinephrine, Cou-NE-H 2 O 2 elicited a synergistic antidepressant action. Furthermore, we identified that Cou-NE-H 2 O 2 can promote the expression of genes such as Grin2a, Drd1, and Fxyd2 related to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway, upregulate glutathione and cysteine to alleviate oxidative stress, and boost neuronal activity by enhancing dopaminergic synapses, ultimately achieving an effective antidepressant response. Taken together, this work provides a new strategy for the evaluation of depression and appropriate treatments and identifies the mechanisms underlying antioxidant and norepinephrine disorders in the brain as potential targets for the development of novel diagnostics and treatments for depression.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogenase enzymes catalyze the reduction of N 2 to NH 3 at a complex Fe-M (M = Mo, Fe, or V) cofactor (FeMco), which displays eight metal centers and sulfide and carbide bridges with a MFe 7 S 8 C composition. The role of the unusual μ 6 -carbide ligand and its effects on the metal centers remain unclear. Here, we describe the transfer of a carbide ligand to a MoFe 3 S 3 cluster supported by a bisphenoxide ligand from a previously reported terminal Mo carbide complex to yield a pentametallic cluster of MoS 3 Fe 3 CMo composition, which also displays a bridging CO that resembles the lo-CO form of nitrogenase. This cluster has an S = 1/2 spin state amenable to studies by pulse EPR spectroscopy, revealing a significantly larger carbide 13 C hyperfine interaction ( a iso ( 13 C) = 12.5 MHz) than any observed for various states of FeMoco studied by EPR thus far (| a iso ( 13 C)| = 0.89 to 2.7 MHz). This report provides a strategy for the synthesis of carbide-containing iron–sulfur clusters relevant to nitrogenase cluster modeling, as well as benchmarking information for the metal–carbon interactions by EPR methods.},

  abstract     = {Cathelicidin-BF (CatBF) is a LL-37 homologous antimicrobial peptide (AMP) isolated from Bungarus fasciatus with an exceptional portfolio of antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal, and anticancer activities. Contrary to many AMPs, it showed a good pharmacological profile with a half-life of at least 1 h in serum and efficacy against bacterial infections in mice. To evaluate its potential against resistant nosocomial infections, we assessed its activity against 81 clinically relevant resistant bacterial isolates. CatBF exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as low as 0.5 μM against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Escherichia coli . Its wide-ranging activity, unaffected by resistance mechanisms or Gram phenotype, prompted us to investigate its molecular mode of action. NMR spectroscopy, paramagnetic probes, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to define its structure, penetration depth, and orientation in various membrane models, including micelles, bicelles, oriented bilayers, and vesicles. We found that CatBF’s potent activity relies on its strong charge, allowing membrane neutralization at low peptide/lipid ratios and selective recruitment of charged phospholipids. At higher concentrations, a change in peptide orientation reveals membrane invagination and the formation of transient pores possibly leading to bacterial death. Our findings highlight the potential of CatBF as a model for developing resistance-independent agents to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections.},

  abstract     = {The mycobacterial cell envelope plays both infectious and protective roles. Understanding its structure is crucial for unlocking the molecular basis underlying these functions. Studying glycans, the primary components of the cell envelope, is challenging due to their limited native functional handles for chemoselective modification. New labeling methods exploit biorthogonal chemistry, using small molecule mimics that intercept cellular metabolism or late-stage glycan biosynthesis. However, these strategies can have practical limitations, including probe delivery and effectiveness. An ideal small molecule probe should be easily deployed and exploit the critical enzyme–substrate relationships of natural substrates. To this end, we developed a “probegenic” strategy to label mycobacteria. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit substrate mimicry, as the relevant functionality is revealed by a target enzyme. Specifically, we synthesized an azide-substituted trans- β-lactone probe (AzLac), which adopts a substrate-like structure upon covalent enzyme labeling. This probe is incorporated by mycolyltransferases into a core mycobacterial cell envelope glycan, including in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Unlike other probes of the cell envelope, AzLac facilitates selective covalent labeling of the inner leaflet of the mycomembrane. Using Corynebacterium glutamicum mycolyltransferase deletion strains, we implicated Cmt2 as the primary mycolyltransferase target. We leveraged the ability to modify the cell envelope by demonstrating that AzLac could be used to attach a DNA barcode to mycobacteria, which would help track infection dynamics. Thus, we expect AzLac will be a valuable means of monitoring and tracking the mycobacterial cell envelope. Moreover, we anticipate masking and revealing recognition motifs in probes can be applied to diverse cellular targets.},

  abstract     = {The application of NMR to large RNAs has been limited by the inability to perform heteronuclear correlation experiments essential for resolving overlapping 1 H NMR signals, determining interproton distance restraints and interhelical orientations for structure calculations, and evaluating conformational dynamics. Approaches exploiting 1 H– 13 C correlations that are routinely applied to proteins and small RNAs of ∼60 nucleotides or fewer are impractical for larger RNAs due to rapid dipolar relaxation of protons by their attached carbons. Here we report a 2 H-enhanced, 1 H– 15 N correlation approach that enables atom-specific NMR characterization of much larger RNAs. Purine H8 transverse relaxation rates are reduced ∼20-fold with ribose perdeuteration, enabling efficient magnetization transfer via two-bond 1 H– 15 N couplings. We focus on H8–N9 correlation spectra which benefit from favorable N9 chemical shift anisotropy. Chemical shift assignment is enabled by retention of protons at the C1′ position, which allow measurement of two-bond H1′–N9 and through-space H1′–H8 correlations with only a minor effect on H8 relaxation. The approach is demonstrated for the 232 nucleotide HIV-1 Rev response element, where chemical shift assignments, 15 N-edited nuclear Overhauser effects, and 1 H– 15 N residual dipolar couplings are readily obtained from sensitive, high-resolution spectra. Heteronuclear correlated NMR methods that have been essential for the study of proteins can now be extended to RNAs of at least 78 kDa.},

Among complex superconductors, those containing distinct superconducting layers are quite rare. In this work, based on the block-layer model together with formation energy calculations, we have designed and successfully synthesized a quinary intermetallic compound, Th 2 Mo 2 Ir 2 Si 4 C. The new material crystallizes in an intergrowth structure with an alternate stacking of superconducting ThMo 2 Si 2 C and ThIr 2 Si 2 block layers along the crystallographic c axis. The interblock-layer interaction is dominated by the Si–Ir bonding, which results in a relatively shorter interlayer distance and a stronger coupling between [Mo 2 Si 2 C] and fluorite-type [Si 2 Ir 2 ] layers. Enhanced superconductivity, with a superconducting transition temperature of T c = 3.4 K and a zero-temperature upper critical field of H c2 (0) = 9.5 kOe, is revealed by measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. The strategy of the block-layer design demonstrated here can be extended to other intergrowth systems with various functional motifs.},

The QUAO analysis clearly identifies a three-center interaction responsible for either hydrogen or chalcogen bonds: in the former, the σ-bond connecting the donor and hydrogen atom participating in the hydrogen bond interacts with the lone pair on the nucleophile acceptor via the hydrogen atom, while in the latter this same σ-bond interacts with the nucleophile lone pair via the donor chalcogen. The number of minimum energy structures increase dramatically from one for (H 2 O) 2 , three for (H 2 S) 2 , four for (H 2 Se) 2 , and finally six for (H 2 Te) 2 . The emergence of the chalcogen-bonded arrangements appears for (H 2 S) 2 with their subsequent energetic stabilization over the hydrogen-bonded minima manifesting in (H 2 Se) 2 and (H 2 Te) 2 . In particular, one of the (H 2 S) 2 , two of the (H 2 Se) 2 , and three of the (H 2 Te) 2 dimers are chalcogen bonded. Induction plays a small but important role in stabilizing hydrogen over chalcogen-bonded structures, while dispersion is more important for chalcogen bonds.},

Less frequently, molecular catalysts are employed to better control the reactivity toward desired products, yet the development of robust semiconductor/molecule interfaces has proven challenging. Here, we demonstrate that a 2–3 nm thermal oxide layer on Si exhibits stability in aqueous solution, high photovoltage, and a photocurrent density of ∼10 mA/cm 2 for the solar-driven photoelectrochemical reduction of a homogeneous molecular catalyst, producing syngas with an ∼2:1 H 2 to CO ratio. Because of a low defect density, the oxide interface forms an electron inversion layer with metal-like electron density at cathodic potentials. This inversion layer facilitates electron transfer to redox-active molecules via tunneling even if the molecule’s reduction potential is beyond the semiconductor’s conduction band edge. Using an electrolyte solution composed of a homogeneous cobalt bis(terpyridine) catalyst in a water/organic solvent mixture, stable photoelectrochemistry was observed under 1-sun illumination, exhibiting an ∼30% Faradaic efficiency for CO that was similar to a glassy carbon electrode under comparable conditions. The results demonstrate that an ultrathin thermal oxide interface is a robust platform for development of aqueous-stable, molecule-driven photoelectrocatalysis.},

Simple Se and ethyl modifications on methylene blue (MB) endow EBSe with a remarkable phototoxicity enhancement (&gt;2500 folds) and an excellent phototoxicity index (PI &gt; 32,000) to 4T1 cells under hypoxia. EBSe exhibits self-adaptive photodynamic processes that generate enhanced type I/II ROS under normoxia and elevate carbon radical production under hypoxia. Interestingly, EBSe shows much higher cell uptake and undergoes photoinduced lysosomal-to-nucleus translocation, which activates ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and oncosis. The synergism of three nonapoptotic pathways potentiates antitumor immune responses in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice.

While many of the Mtb divisome proteins have been identified, their structures and interactions remain largely unknown. Previous studies of CrgA using oriented-sample solid-state NMR have defined the tilt and rotation of the TM helices, but the cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains and even the oligomeric state were uncharacterized. Here, by combining oriented-sample and magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR spectra, we solved the full-length structure of CrgA. The structure features a dimer with a TM domain sandwiched between a cytoplasmic β-sheet and a periplasmic β-sheet. The β-sheets stabilize dimerization, which in turn increases CrgA’s ability to participate in multiple protein interactions. Within the membrane, CrgA binds FtsQ, CwsA, PbpA, FtsI, and MmPL3 via its TM helices; in the cytoplasm, Lys23 and Lys25 project outward from the β-sheet to interact with acidic residues of FtsQ and FtsZ. The structural determination of CrgA thus provides significant insights into its roles in recruiting other divisome proteins and stabilizing their complexes for Mtb cell wall synthesis and polar growth.},

However, thermal quenching significantly reduces radioluminescence efficiency, particularly for those phosphorescent scintillators with promising radiation-induced triplet exciton utilization, ultimately limiting their applications in high-temperature scenarios. Herein, we develop ultrahigh-temperature scintillators based on organic ionic host–guest phosphorescence systems with unprecedented thermal-stable emissions up to 673 K. The guest phosphor features spin-vibronic coupling-assisted intersystem crossing, effectively transforming phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence for overcoming thermal inactivation of triplet excitons. Meanwhile, the rigid ionic host and guest with robust electrostatic interactions minimize both the intrinsic and extrinsic nonradiations of excitons, the so-called dual-confined nonradiation. These two mechanisms work synergistically, contributing to the highly efficient triplet exciton-based luminescence with a room-temperature phosphorescence efficiency of 38.7% and ultrahigh-temperature-resistant dual emissions. Such an innovative ionic host–guest scintillator achieves an impressively low X-ray detection limit of 71.5 nGy s –1 and remarkably bright photoluminescence (efficiency of 80.4% at 483 K), enabling ultrahigh-temperature X-ray imaging.},

  abstract     = {Memory effect in ion transport (IT) at the solid–solution interface is uniquely attractive in that the conductance depends on or “memorizes” the previous states. Hysteretic and rectified transport properties offer exciting potential to developing advanced iontronics and neuromorphic functions, improving the efficiency of energy conversion and electrochemical processes, and overcoming the selectivity-throughput bottleneck in the enrichment of low abundant species for environment- and energy-friendly separations, among others. Herein, memory effects are discovered in the rectified electrokinetic IT through anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes containing densely packed highly ordered nanochannels (10 10 per cm 2 ). Characteristic memristor responses of pinched current–potential loops are resolved in voltammetric experiments and successfully reproduced through finite element simulation. Excitatory and inhibitory conductance states are shown to arise from the enrichment and depletion of mobile charge carriers. Structurewise, the transport symmetry is broken by the barrier oxide layer (BOL) on the one end of the cylindrical nanochannels across the AAO membranes. Charge selectivity is attributed to the gradient(s) of the space charge density across the BOL characterized by depth profiling via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The space charge gradient(s) overcomes the fundamental limitation of widely exploited surface charge effects to enable intense rectification and hysteresis prevailing at very high ionic concentrations up to 1–2 M. A new strategy is developed for controlling the preferential IT direction and selectivity via counterion intercalation and extraction/exchange.

  abstract     = {Quaternary stereocenters play a crucial role in shaping both the molecular topology of small molecules and the outcome of stereoselective transformations. While considerable progress has been achieved in constructing highly substituted carbon centers with varied substitution patterns, the stereoselective synthesis of quaternary carbon centers remains a significant challenge. Here we report a protocol for the precise manipulation of quaternary stereocenters through epimerization. The critical design element of our ketone α-epimerization process was developing a photoactive imine, which circumvents the numerous deleterious pathways of carbonyl photochemistry. Excitation of this imine with visible light in the presence of a photocatalyst enables reversible C–C bond cleavage and reformation to vary the stereochemistry of the quaternary center. This approach allows us to override intrinsic stereochemical outcomes of C–C bond construction, therefore providing novel tactics for retrosynthetic planning. The broad utility of this protocol was demonstrated by the topological alteration of various classes of carbocyclic scaffolds bearing diverse functional groups.},

  abstract     = {Bulk Li + -conducting lithium superionic conductors are susceptible to disruption by grain boundaries and interparticle porosity, necessitating high densification and consequently limiting the gravimetric energy density of solid-state batteries. Here, we discovered a new class of surface-conducting lithium superionic conductors achieved through surface chemisorption. After bonding with ligands, surface atoms of inert substrates become binding sites for lithium salt dissociation and hopping sites for fast surface Li + diffusion, transforming inert materials into surface-conducting Li + conductors. Using two-dimensional TiO 2 nanosheets as a proof of concept, we show that ethylene glycolate-chemisorbed TiO 2 significantly enhances lithium salt dissociation and promotes fast Li + hopping between surface oxygen atoms, achieving a high surface ion mobility of 3.61 × 10 –7 cm 2 ·V –1 ·s –1 ─an improvement of 600% over the bulk Li + mobility of Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 solid oxide electrolytes. Benefiting from surface Li + conduction, an ultralight oxide aerogel solid-state electrolyte was developed with an unprecedented low density of 0.29 g·cm –3 , which is only 25% of that of liquid electrolytes and 5.7% of garnet-type solid electrolytes. A LiFePO 4 -based solid-state battery utilizing this new electrolyte exhibits a significantly high energy density of ∼295 Wh·kg –1 , achieving 160% of that of a Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 -based solid-state battery even with the same electrolyte thickness. Furthermore, this guideline for designing surface-conducting superionic conductors is generalizable and can be extended to diverse cations and substrates, promising lightweight, highly conductive solid-state electrolytes with broad implications beyond solid-state batteries.},

Here, we introduce a new series of donor–chiral bridge–acceptor (D−χ–A) molecules that demonstrate significant MFEs on fluorescence intensity and lifetime in solution at room temperature─critical for quantum sensing. By precisely tuning the donor site through torsional locking, distance extension, and planarization, we achieved remarkable control over key quantum properties, including field-response range and line width. In the most responsive systems, emission lifetimes increased by over 200%, and the total emission intensity was modulated by up to 30%. This level of tunability shows the power of synthetic spin chemistry. The rational design principle of optically addressable SCRP-based molecular systems, presented in this work, represents a major leap toward functional synthetic molecular qubits, advancing the field of molecular quantum technologies.},

Building such structures with biocompatible peptides offers a potential for prescribed structural addressability and enhanced ETp capability with implications for targeted neural tissue engineering. However, creating ordered π–π tunnels in peptide nanostructures composed entirely of natural amino acids presents challenges resulting from the flexible side chains and the free movement of aromatic residues, causing unpredictable orientation. In this study, a novel peptide nanostructure was constructed through rational design and high-throughput screening leveraging hierarchical β-sheets to achieve molecular programmability. Precise regulation of key residues at the aromatic–hydrophilic junctions within the peptide chain facilitated the transition from single interaction forces (hydrophobic or hydrogen bonding) to synergistic forces, enabling the formation of supramolecular clamps during the lateral stacking of β-sheets. The clamps compel the torsion-angle alternation between aromatic residues and the β-plane, increasing the stacking order of aromatic rings and reducing the π–π distance in the optimized RT peptide system. The RT system promotes the formation of an orderly delocalized electron tunnel, achieving dry-state molecular conductivity composed entirely of natural amino acids. Besides ETp, the RT system also provides neural-targeting capability, flexibility, and mechanical strength, allowing it to support axon elongation and neural restoration, serving as an advanced neuro-electronic interface.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the discovery of unconventional polyhydrides under high pressure, including notable instances like CaH 6 , YH 9 , and LaH 10 , with superconducting critical temperature ( T c ) above 200 K, has ignited considerable interest in the quest for high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-based materials. Recent studies have suggested the highly probable existence of hydrogen vacancies in these high- T c superconducting hydrides, although there is no conclusive evidence. In this study, taking niobium (Nb) hydride as a model, we showcase the observation of nonstoichiometric face-centered cubic ( fcc ) NbH 4-δ (δ∼0.23–0.51) at pressures ranging from 113 to 175 GPa, employing in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments in conjunction with first-principles calculations. Remarkably, our further analyses indicate that the hydrogen vacancies, along with the resulting configurational entropy, play crucial roles in stabilizing this nonstoichiometric fcc NbH 4-δ . Electrical transport measurements confirmed the superconductivity, as evidenced by zero resistance as well as suppression of T c with applying magnetic fields, with a T c reaching up to 34 K. Our current results not only confirm the presence of hydrogen vacancies in high- T c hydrides, but also provide key insights into the understanding of hydrogen-vacancy-induced stability for nonstoichiometric hydrides under high pressure.},

  abstract     = {Ti-catalyzed alkyne diamination and alkyne hydrohydrazination proceed through a common N -aminoazatitanacyclobutene intermediate. These reactions have historically existed as processes catalyzed by distinct molecular Ti compounds, with several reports for hydrohydrazination and only a single example for diamination. Here, we demonstrate that a diamidoamine Ti catalyst, (NNN)Ti(═NN R 2 ) ( 1, (NNN)H 2 = N -methyl- N ’, N ″-bis(trimethylsilyl)diethylenetriamine; R = alkyl, aryl), is capable of catalyzing both diamination and hydrohydrazination, where the selectivity is dictated by simple changes to the reaction conditions. This approach capitalizes on the fact that there are entropic differences at the selectivity branch point between diamination (unimolecular) and hydrohydrazination (bimolecular). This discovery leads to an expanded substrate scope for alkyne diamination and provides an understanding of how structure–activity relationships can impact the relative rates (selectivity) of diamination and hydrohydrazination. These structure–activity relationships, anchored on 15 N NMR descriptors, were then used to design a novel, highly active, and selective diamination catalyst, (NNN SiMe2Ph )Ti(═NN R 2 ) ( 1f ), which contains bulkier flanking amide ligands. More broadly, these results suggest that this strategy may be applied more generally to Ti hydrohydrazination catalysts to uncover new catalysts capable of alkyne diamination with 1,1-disubstituted hydrazines.},

  abstract     = {Li–O 2 batteries have aroused considerable interest due to high theoretical energy density; however, the singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) generated in both discharge and charge processes induces severe parasitic reactions and leads to their low round-trip efficiency and poor rechargeability. Herein, a universal heavy atom-induced quenching mechanism is proposed to suppress 1 O 2 and related side reactions. Br in tris(4-bromophenyl)amine (TBPA) induces strong heavy atom-induced spin–orbit coupling (SOC), enhancing the interaction between the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum of the electron. It enables TBPA to capture electrophilic 1 O 2 to form a singlet complex and then effectively drives the spin-forbidden spin-flip process to form a triplet complex. This accelerates the conversion of 1 O 2 to ground-state 3 O 2 through a heavy atom-induced intersystem crossing mechanism, and it efficiently eliminates its attack on organic solvents and carbon cathodes. These endow the Li–O 2 battery with reduced overvoltages and prolonged lifespan for over 350 cycles when coupled with a RuO 2 catalyst. This work highlights the heavy atom-induced SOC to quench 1 O 2 in oxygen evolution reaction-related devices.},

  abstract     = {For water splitting, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying reaction intermediates and pathways is crucial for optimizing catalyst design. Among the most well-known active photoanodes for the oxygen evolution half-reaction are TiO 2 -based materials. A hole polaron, which consists of a metal-oxide distortion around trapped holes, has been suggested as a local reactive oxygen configuration. While first-principles calculations identify new electronic states in the middle of the band gap and the influence of trapped hole dynamics on transport, an assignment of hole polaron configurations to a measured spectrum has been challenging due to broad optical transitions in the visible regime. Here, we compare the excited-state absorption (ESA) for two titanium oxide materials with a similar electronic structure but differing crystal structure. The ESA maximum for ultrafast time scales (&lt;1 ps) is isolated by a principal component analysis and shifts from 3.1 eV in rutile TiO 2 (100) to 2.2 eV in perovskite SrTiO 3 . Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations predict the energies of the midgap states for stable hole polarons and their corresponding spectra. The shift in the ESA is rationalized by the transition optical dipole originating from both edge and deeper states in the valence band being bright for certain configurations of hole polarons in rutile TiO 2 (100) (terminal O •– ) versus STO (lateral Ti 2 O •– ). The spectral assignment of a shifting ESA between two titanium oxide materials informs the assignment of hole polaron configurations for oxygen evolution catalysis and, more generally, photodriven processes.},

The amount of hydrogen loaded into the palladium can be controlled electrochemically to form a well-defined and static PdH x ratio for studying chemical hydrogenation. These static PdH x ratios are otherwise difficult to achieve. We show a preference for homolytic hydrogen transfer pathways at lower current densities and heterolytic hydrogen transfer pathways at higher current densities.

The interaction between adsorbed catalyst vibrations and the QD electron intraband absorption can influence the photophysical properties of both the QD and the catalysts and potentially their photocatalysis. In CdSe QDs functionalized by the CO 2 reduction catalyst, Re(CO) 3 (4,4’-bipyridine-COOH)Cl, we observe that the transient Fano resonance signal resulting from coupling of the catalyst CO stretching mode and the QD conduction band electron mid-IR intraband absorption appears on an ultrafast time scale and decays with the electron population, irrespective of the occurrence of photoreduced catalysts. The Fano asymmetry factor increases with an increase in the adsorbed catalyst number and a decrease in QD sizes. The latter can be attributed to an enhanced charge transfer interaction between the more strongly quantum-confined QD conduction band and catalyst LUMO levels. These results provide a more in-depth understanding of interactions in excited QD-catalyst hybrid photocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {The protonation of CO is recognized as the rate-determining step in the generation of C1 products during the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) on Cu surfaces. However, the detailed mechanism and the precise proton source remain elusive. While density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the GGA level have been widely used, they struggle to accurately describe adsorbate-metal interactions and surface stability. Here, we employed the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), a method based on many-body perturbation theory, to overcome these limitations. We coupled the RPA framework with the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation to model solvation effects and a surface charging method to account for the influence of the electrochemical potential. Our study reveals that in neutral or alkaline electrolytes, adsorbed surface water acts as the proton source for *CO reduction to *COH over a broad potential range via the Grotthuss mechanism. At highly negative potentials, solvent water becomes the primary proton donor, with multiple competing mechanisms observed. In contrast, DFT-GGA functionals significantly underestimate the reaction barriers for *COH formation and consistently predict solvent water as the proton source across all potentials of interest. Additionally, RPA offers distinct insights into H 2 O adsorption and highlights the significant range of reducing potentials within which surface *OH can exist, which is crucial for accurate CO 2 RR modeling. These insights illustrate a pronounced divergence between RPA and DFT-GGA results. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on proton transfer in CO 2 RR and establish a framework for future theoretical studies on electrochemical processes.},

Although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been established as a powerful analytical technique for interface chemistry, the necessity for ultrahigh vacuum remains a significant obstacle to directly detecting dynamic interfacial evolution, particularly in aqueous environments. Here, we employ tender-energy ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) to bridge the gap between ultrahigh vacuum and near-atmospheric pressure, enabling an in-depth investigation of the molecule-crowded aqueous interface evolution in a Zn metal anode. The results demonstrate that the persistent presence of additive molecules effectively inhibits direct contact between reactive Zn and H 2 O, while also facilitating uniform Zn deposition. In situ optical microscopy observations and synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction further verified the uniform and dense Zn deposition, attributed to lateral growth induced by the (002) crystal facet evolution. As proof of its effectiveness, batteries incorporating the Zn//Zn, Zn//Cu, and full cell with the additive demonstrate significantly improved stability and reversibility.

  abstract     = {Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) play an important role in gene therapy, yet the optimal preparation of these biotherapeutics remains challenging, with often incomplete incorporation of genome cargo, negatively affecting therapeutic use. Genome packaging has traditionally been difficult to investigate. Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) has gained prominence, as it provides the ability to mass analyze and resolve empty and filled rAAVs, enabling the quantitative determination of empty-to-filled rAAV ratios. Such measurements require a high mass resolving power and depend on the unbiased detectability of the distinct rAAV particles. The mass resolving power in the Orbitrap mass analyzers scales with transient recording times. Therefore, we extended the capability of recording ions from 1 or 2 to 24 s. When we record these 24 s transients to analyze rAAVs, we not only observe a substantial improvement in accuracy and mass resolution but also find that this can lead to erroneous artifacts in the empty-to-filled ratios. Artifacts originate from the distinct behavior between orbiting ions from either empty or filled particles, mainly due to differences in desolvation and charge losses. Ions from empty rAAVs appear much more susceptible to charge losses, which negatively affect their tracing, artificially decreasing the empty-to-filled ratios. Further elucidating the causes of this undesirable ion behavior, we provide the means to minimize charge losses, thus regaining accurate AAV quantification at an increased charge precision and mass-resolving power. As the Orbitrap-based CDMS has become a method of choice to determine this important quality control attribute, our findings are important to avoid reporting incorrect empty-to-filled ratios.},

Using online mass spectrometry, we directly detected the dioxygen splitting products O 3 – and H 2 O·O 3 – in microdroplets. The high electric field at the air–water interface, along with microlightning between oppositely charged water microdroplets, induces an electrical discharge responsible for the O–O bond cleavage, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Isotope labeling experiments further reveal that various ROS, i.e., ·OH, CO 3 – , and HCO 4 – , can be generated through the reaction of dioxygen splitting products with water or CO 2 .

  abstract     = {Enzyme engineering and discovery are crucial for a sustainable future bioeconomy. Harvesting new biocatalysts from large libraries through directed evolution or functional metagenomics requires accessible, rapid assays. Ultrahigh-throughput screening formats often require optical readouts, leading to the use of model substrates that may misreport target activity and necessitate bespoke synthesis. This is a particular challenge when screening glycosyl hydrolases, which leverage molecular recognition beyond the target glycosidic bond, so that complex chemical synthesis would have to be deployed to build a fluoro- or chromogenic substrate. In contrast, coupled assays represent a modular “plug-and-play” system: any enzyme–substrate pairing can be investigated, provided the reaction can produce a common intermediate which links the catalytic reaction to a detection cascade readout. Here, we establish a detection cascade producing a fluorescent readout in response to NAD(P)H via glutathione reductase and a subsequent thiol-mediated uncaging reaction, with a low nanomolar detection limit in plates. Further scaling down to microfluidic droplet screening is possible: the fluorophore is leakage-free and we report 3 orders of magnitude-improved sensitivity compared to absorbance-based systems, with a resolution of 361,000 product molecules per droplet. Our approach enables the use of nonfluorogenic substrates in droplet-based enrichments, with applicability in screening for glycosyl hydrolases and imine reductases (IREDs). To demonstrate the assay’s readiness for combinatorial experiments, one round of directed evolution was performed to select a glycosidase processing a natural substrate, beechwood xylan, with improved kinetic parameters from a pool of &gt;10 6 mutagenized sequences.},

Here we develop and validate the Holdup Multiplex, a versatile assay with a mass spectrometry (MS) readout for profiling the affinities of a protein for large pools of peptides. The method can precisely quantify, in one single run, thousands of affinity constants over several orders of magnitude. The throughput, dynamic range, and sensitivity can be pushed to the performance limit of the MS readout. We applied the Holdup Multiplex to quantify in a few sample runs the affinities of the 14–3–3s, phosphoreader proteins highly abundant in humans, for 1000 different phosphopeptides. The seven human 14–3–3 isoforms were found to display similar specificities but staggered affinities, with 14–3–3γ being always the best binder and 14–3–3ε and σ being the weakest. Hundreds of new 14–3–3 binding sites were identified. We also identified dozens of 14–3–3 binding sites, some intervening in key signaling pathways, that were either stabilized or destabilized by the phytotoxin Fusicoccin-A. The results were corroborated by X-ray crystallography. Finally, we demonstrated the transferability of the Holdup Multiplex by quantifying the interactions of a PDZ domain for 5400 PBM peptides at once.

In this study, we determined the X-ray structures of β3GalT5 in complex with the stable donor analogue UDP-2-fluorogalactose or the native donor substrate UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and several glycan acceptors at different reaction steps. Based on the structures obtained from our experiments, β3GalT5 catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-Gal to a broad spectrum of glycan acceptors with an S N 2-like mechanism; however, in the absence of a glycan acceptor, UDP-Gal is slowly converted to UDP and two other products, one is galactose through an S N 2-like mechanism with water as an acceptor and the other is an oxocarbenium-like product, presumably through an S N 1-like mechanisms.

To improve the efficiency, we explored the two human galactosyltransferase (β3GalT5) isozymes in cancer cells for this reaction and found that isozyme 1 (β3GalT5–1) is more active than isozyme 2 (β3GalT5–2). We then identified a common soluble domain of the two β3GalT5 isozymes as a candidate and evaluated the activity and substrate specificity of the glycosylated and nonglycosylated glycoforms. The glycoforms expressed in Sf9 cells were selected, and a site-specific alanine scan was performed to identify S66A β3GalT5 variant with 10-fold more efficiency than LgtD for the synthesis of globo-series glycans.

While the substitution of an alkyl electrophile by a nitrogen nucleophile is a seemingly straightforward approach to generating a carbon–nitrogen bond, in practice classical substitution pathways have very substantial limitations in the case of unactivated secondary and tertiary alkyl electrophiles. Recent reports that transition metals can catalyze certain substitution reactions of such electrophiles are therefore of considerable significance; however, virtually no methods have been developed wherein absolute stereochemistry is controlled together with carbon–nitrogen bond formation. Herein, we address this dual challenge of reactivity and enantioselectivity, describing a photoinduced, copper-catalyzed enantioconvergent synthesis of β-aminoalcohol derivatives via the coupling of anilines with racemic, unactivated β-haloethers. We apply this method to a catalytic asymmetric synthesis of metolachlor, and we report an array of mechanistic studies that are consistent with the reaction pathway that we propose.},

  abstract     = {Near-infrared (NIR) light-driven photoreactions are advantageous over visible light-driven ones because NIR photons have lower energy and fewer side reactions, deeper penetration in reaction media, and high abundance in the solar spectrum. However, currently available covalent organic frameworks (COFs) absorb in the UV–vis region and catalyze photoreactions under blue or white light irradiation. Herein, we report a linker-to-linker charge transfer process in a viologen-linked porphyrin COF (Vio-COF), leading to a novel type of hyperporphyrin effect and extending the absorption into the NIR region with an absorption edge at 998 nm. Under NIR irradiation, photoinduced charge separation in Vio-COF generates a viologen radical that efficiently reduces oxygen to form superoxide radicals for catalytic oxidative coupling reactions. The proximity of porphyrin and viologen units within the framework significantly enhances the catalytic performance of Vio-COF, outperforming its homogeneous counterparts in aerobic oxidative amidation and amine coupling reactions. Vio-COF was readily recycled and used in six oxidative coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {Reticular chemistry has greatly stimulated the development of framework materials, yet covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring irregular tiling are rare, because of the strict constraints on irregular tile lengths and angles. Guided by reticular chemistry, we deconstructed type III irregular hexagonal tiling into a combination of D 2 h + D 2 h monomers and achieved the first successful synthesis of 2D COFs featuring such tiling with hit topology. By tuning the crystal growth conditions, we obtained a set of reticular isomers, COF-hit and COF-bex, with distinct reticular structures. Powder X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy were employed to precisely characterize their topology structures. COF-hit demonstrates outstanding water absorption capabilities under high humidity conditions. This rational design of COFs using irregular tiling opens a new avenue to diversify the structural types and topological varieties of COFs and promote the development of reticular chemistry.},

Sonication of ZIF-L ethanolic suspensions leads to exfoliation of microcrystals along the 2 0 0 planes, giving rise to 1.5 μm wide × 25 nm thick flakes, which we term ZIF-L_exf. ZIF-L_exf exhibits a high reactivity toward hydrolytic degradation of extremely toxic G-type nerve agents, Soman (GD), and simulant diisopropylfluorophosphate (DIFP). The reactivity of the crystal surface of ZIF-L_exf toward P–F bond breakdown gives rise to framework structural degradation, releasing nucleophilic mImH molecules that reactivate organophosphate-inhibited acetylcholinesterase within 10 min. This detoxification process can be taken as a proof of concept for reversing organophosphorous poisoning. More generally, this approach underscores the importance of the crystal surface nature and composition to control the reactivity of reticular materials.},

  abstract     = {Solar-driven one-step-excitation overall water splitting is one of the most straightforward ways of achieving scalable solar hydrogen production. Despite its advantage in visible-light response and stability, the pristine bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) alone is not capable of achieving overall water splitting due to its conduction band energy level being insufficient for the proton reduction reaction, further limited by the severe charge recombination. Here, we demonstrate the three-dimensionally ordered macroporous BiVO 4 with a carefully enlarged bandgap of 2.58 eV and a conduction band energy of −0.49 eV versus normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7.0. On loading Rh/Cr 2 O 3 as a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst, the stochiometric evolution of hydrogen and oxygen in a recyclable manner is accomplished under visible light with an apparent quantum yield of 0.47% at 400 nm. Further study by Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals an intensified internal electric field with a downward band bending from the interconnection part to the internal wall of the periodic porous structure upon loading the cocatalysts. Our findings transform BiVO 4 from a typical water oxidation photocatalyst into a new paradigm for single-component photocatalysts for overall water splitting.},

Using 209 Bi and 127 I solid-state NMR (SSNMR) for characterization is extremely challenging due to the exceedingly large quadrupolar interactions in MOFs. Here, we present ultra-wideline (UW) SSNMR spectra of eight MOFs acquired at ultra-high magnetic fields up to 36 T, with breadths of 8–50 MHz, revealing very large quadrupolar couplings. These spectra uncover key structural details, including dehydration, guest adsorption, phase transitions, and disorder. This study establishes 209 Bi and 127 I UW SSNMR as powerful tools for probing Bi and I ions in weight-dilute systems, offering broad applications in catalysis, solar cells, biochemistry, and beyond.},
