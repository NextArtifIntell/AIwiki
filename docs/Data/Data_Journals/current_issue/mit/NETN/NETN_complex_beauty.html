  abstract     = {In recurrent networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, the mean-field theory has been instrumental in capturing the statistical properties of neuronal activity, like firing rate distributions. This theory has been applied to networks with either homogeneous synaptic weights and heterogeneous connections per neuron or vice versa. Our work expands mean-field models to include networks with both types of structural heterogeneity simultaneously, particularly focusing on those with synapses that undergo plastic changes. The model introduces a spike trace for each neuron, a variable that rises with neuron spikes and decays without activity, influenced by a degradation rate r p and the neuron’s firing rate ν . When the ratio α = ν / r p is significantly high, this trace effectively estimates the neuron’s firing rate, allowing synaptic weights at equilibrium to be determined by the firing rates of connected neurons. This relationship is incorporated into our mean-field formalism, providing exact solutions for firing rate and synaptic weight distributions at equilibrium in the high α regime. However, the model remains accurate within a practical range of degradation rates, as demonstrated through simulations with networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This approach sheds light on how plasticity modulates both activity and structure within neuronal networks, offering insights into their complex behavior. Networks of spiking neurons are complex systems where the structure of connections and the activity patterns generated are deeply intertwined, a relationship often studied using mathematical approaches like the mean-field theory. However, previous studies have primarily focused on networks with limited structural variability, where either the connection strength is nearly identical across the network or the number of connections varies little from one neuron to another. This work takes a step forward by combining both types of structural variability and allowing connection strengths to adapt over time, thereby providing an extended mean-field theory. We derive exact solutions for the distribution of spiking rates and connection strengths at equilibrium and demonstrate their accuracy through numerical simulations, even beyond the defining parameter ranges, offering a more comprehensive and realistic perspective on the interplay between activity and structure in neuronal networks.},

  abstract     = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is widely used for studying resting-state brain connectivity. However, MEG source imaging is ill posed and has limited spatial resolution. This introduces source-leakage issues, making it challenging to interpret MEG-derived connectivity in resting states. To address this, we validated MEG-derived connectivity from 45 healthy participants using a normative intracranial EEG (iEEG) atlas. The MEG inverse problem was solved using the wavelet-maximum entropy on the mean method. We computed four connectivity metrics: amplitude envelope correlation (AEC), orthogonalized AEC (OAEC), phase locking value (PLV), and weighted-phase lag index (wPLI). We compared spatial correlation between MEG and iEEG connectomes across standard canonical frequency bands. We found moderate spatial correlations between MEG and iEEG connectomes for AEC and PLV. However, when considering metrics that correct/remove zero-lag connectivity (OAEC/wPLI), the spatial correlation between MEG and iEEG connectomes decreased. MEG exhibited higher zero-lag connectivity compared with iEEG. The correlations between MEG and iEEG connectomes suggest that relevant connectivity patterns can be recovered from MEG. However, since these correlations are moderate/low, MEG connectivity results should be interpreted with caution. Metrics that correct for zero-lag connectivity show decreased correlations, highlighting a trade-off; while MEG may capture more connectivity due to source-leakage, removing zero-lag connectivity can eliminate true connections. The ill-posed nature and low spatial resolution of EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging affects functional connectivity estimates, which become more complicated in the resting state due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Several connectivity metrics have been proposed to address source leakage by removing zero-lag connectivity, although this can eliminate true neuronal zero-lag connections. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) is the gold standard for validating noninvasive measurements. In this study, we validated MEG-estimated connectivity for healthy subjects using the iEEG atlas of normal brain activity ( Frauscher et al., 2018 ) as ground truth at a group level. We employed two amplitude-based metrics and two phase-based metrics. Our findings highlight how MEG connectivity compares with the iEEG atlas and provide valuable insights for resting-state EEG/MEG connectomic studies, particularly in the choice of connectivity metrics.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant research, discovering causal relationships from fMRI remains a challenge. Popular methods such as Granger causality and dynamic causal modeling fall short in handling contemporaneous effects and latent common causes. Methods from causal structure learning literature can address these limitations but often scale poorly with network size and need acyclicity. In this study, we first provide a taxonomy of existing methods and compare their accuracy and efficiency on simulated fMRI from simple topologies. This analysis demonstrates a pressing need for more accurate and scalable methods, motivating the design of Causal discovery for Large-scale Low-resolution Time-series with Feedback (CaLLTiF). CaLLTiF is a constraint-based method that uses conditional independence between contemporaneous and lagged variables to extract causal relationships. On simulated fMRI from the macaque connectome, CaLLTiF achieves significantly higher accuracy and scalability than all tested alternatives. From resting-state human fMRI, CaLLTiF learns causal connectomes that are highly consistent across individuals, show clear top-down flow of causal effect from attention and default mode to sensorimotor networks, exhibit Euclidean distance dependence in causal interactions, and are highly dominated by contemporaneous effects. Overall, this work takes a major step in enhancing causal discovery from whole-brain fMRI and defines a new standard for future investigations. Discovering causal relationships from fMRI data is challenging due to contemporaneous effects and latent causes. Popular methods like Granger causality and dynamic causal modeling struggle with these issues, especially in large networks. To address this, we introduce Causal discovery for Large-scale Low-resolution Time-series with Feedback (CaLLTiF), a scalable method that uses both lagged and contemporaneous variables to identify causal relationships. CaLLTiF outperforms various existing techniques in accuracy and scalability on simulated fMRI data. When applied to human resting-state fMRI, it reveals consistent and biologically plausible patterns across individuals, with a clear top-down causal flow from attention and default mode networks to sensorimotor areas. Overall, this work advances the field of causal discovery in large-scale fMRI studies.},

Here, we investigated the test-retest reliability of two dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) brain states and related parameters for different scan length, atlases with 116 versus 442 regions, and data centering in 23 participants and reproduced the findings in 501 subjects of the Human Connectome Project. Results showed an integrated and a segregated brain state with high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values of the states between sessions (0.67 ≥ ICC ≥ 0.99). The most reliable dFC parameter was state prevalence with an ICC ≈ 0.5 for ∼15 min of uncentered data, while other parameters, such as mean dwell time, were much less reliable. While shorter scans and within-subject data centering further reduce reliability, the atlas choice had no effects. Spearman’s correlations among dFC parameters strongly depend on data centering. The effect of global signal regression and a higher number of states is discussed. In conclusion, we recommend formulating hypotheses on cross-sectional differences and correlations between dFC measures of brain integration and other subject-specific measures in terms of state prevalence, especially in small-scale studies. We investigated the reliability of popular parameters characterizing dynamic brain states in two datasets. We found high reliability of clustering results with a two-state model but only medium to low reliability of the parameters, of which state prevalence across different strategies was the most reliable.},

  abstract     = {The functional and cognitive effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are poorly understood, as even mild injuries (concussion) can lead to long-lasting, untreatable symptoms. Simplified brain dynamics models may help researchers better understand the relationship between brain injury patterns and functional outcomes. Properly developed, these computational models provide an approach to investigate the effects of both computational and in vivo injury on simulated dynamics and cognitive function, respectively, for model organisms. In this study, we apply the Kuramoto model and an existing mesoscale mouse brain structural network to develop a simplified computational model of mouse brain dynamics. We explore how to optimize our initial model to predict existing mouse brain functional connectivity collected from mice under various anesthetic protocols. Finally, to determine how strongly the changes in our optimized models’ dynamics can predict the extent of a brain injury, we investigate how our simulations respond to varying levels of structural network damage. Results predict a mixture of hypo- and hyperconnectivity after experimental TBI, similar to results in TBI survivors, and also suggest a compensatory remodeling of connections that may have an impact on functional outcomes after TBI. Recent research has investigated the consequences of traumatic brain injuries by combining computational models of human brain activity and structural models of the whole human brain or cortex. As experimental injury research can only be conducted using animal models, we apply a simplified computational model of whole-brain dynamics, the Kuramoto model, to a mouse brain structural network. We tune our model to best predict measurements of functional connectivity recorded from 58 fMRI scans of mice and lesion the network model to explore the effects of injury. Our findings predict that functional connectivity may increase or decrease in various regions of the brain, even at a high injury level, which may aid in future predictions of cognitive impairments after brain injury.},

  abstract     = {Sustained attention is essential for daily life and can be directed to information from different perceptual modalities, including audition and vision. Recently, cognitive neuroscience has aimed to identify neural predictors of behavior that generalize across datasets. Prior work has shown strong generalization of models trained to predict individual differences in sustained attention performance from patterns of fMRI functional connectivity. However, it is an open question whether predictions of sustained attention are specific to the perceptual modality in which they are trained. In the current study, we test whether connectome-based models predict performance on attention tasks performed in different modalities. We show first that a predefined network trained to predict adults’ visual sustained attention performance generalizes to predict auditory sustained attention performance in three independent datasets ( N 1 = 29, N 2 = 60, N 3 = 17). Next, we train new network models to predict performance on visual and auditory attention tasks separately. We find that functional networks are largely modality general, with both model-unique and shared model features predicting sustained attention performance in independent datasets regardless of task modality. Results support the supposition that visual and auditory sustained attention rely on shared neural mechanisms and demonstrate robust generalizability of whole-brain functional network models of sustained attention. While previous work has demonstrated external validity of functional connectivity-based networks for the prediction of cognitive and attentional performance, testing generalization across visual and auditory perceptual modalities has been limited. The current study demonstrates robust prediction of sustained attention performance, regardless of perceptual modality models are trained or tested in. Results demonstrate that connectivity-based models may generalize broadly, capturing variance in sustained attention performance that is agnostic to the perceptual modality of model training.},

We observe considerable differences in neuronal dynamics between glioma patients and healthy controls, both on an individual and population-based level. In particular, model parameter estimation suggests that local tumor pathology causes changes in brain dynamics by increasing the influence of interregional interactions on global neuronal activity.

  abstract     = {Amyloid- β (A β ) plaques in conjunction with hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the form of neurofibrillary tangles are the two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. It is well-known that the identification of individuals with A β positivity could enable early diagnosis. In this work, we aim at capturing the A β positivity status in an unbalanced cohort enclosing subjects at different disease stages, exploiting the underlying structural and connectivity disease-induced modulations as revealed by structural, functional, and diffusion MRI. Of note, due to the unbalanced cohort, the outcomes may be guided by those factors rather than amyloid accumulation. The partial views provided by each modality are integrated in the model, allowing to take full advantage of their complementarity in encoding the effects of the A β accumulation, leading to an accuracy of 0.762 ± 0.04. The specificity of the information brought by each modality is assessed by post hoc explainability analysis (guided backpropagation), highlighting the underlying structural and functional changes. Noteworthy, well-established biomarker key regions related to A β deposition could be identified by all modalities, including the hippocampus, thalamus, precuneus, and cingulate gyrus, witnessing in favor of the reliability of the method as well as its potential in shedding light on modality-specific possibly unknown A β deposition signatures. In this work, we employed a multimodal MRI-based deep learning framework for the classification of unbalanced cohorts relying on the amyloid- β status in the Alzheimer’s disease continuum. To this end, structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data were used to feed a 3D-convolutional neural network and two different graph neural networks, respectively, reaching an accuracy of 0.762 ± 0.04. Post hoc explainability analysis was performed to extract the most relevant regions that led to the outcome, highlighting the involvement of different cortical and subcortical regions. This work provides evidence of the added value brought by exploiting different imaging modalities in decrypting the nature and extent of brain alterations in the amyloid-guided classification outcome.},

Beyond capturing the key mechanisms underlying spontaneous brain dynamics, these models hold an exciting potential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the dynamics evoked by targeted brain stimulation techniques. This paper delves into this emerging application, using concepts from dynamical systems theory to argue that the stimulus-evoked dynamics in such experiments may be shaped by new types of mechanisms distinct from those that dominate spontaneous dynamics. We review and discuss (a) the targeted experimental techniques across spatial scales that can both perturb the brain to novel states and resolve its relaxation trajectory back to spontaneous dynamics and (b) how we can understand these dynamics in terms of mechanisms using physiological, phenomenological, and data-driven models. A tight integration of targeted stimulation experiments with generative quantitative modeling provides an important opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms of brain dynamics that are difficult to detect in spontaneous settings. Generative models are important tools for testing hypothesized mechanisms of brain dynamics against experimental data. This review highlights an application of generative models in analyzing a form of brain activity evoked by emerging targeted stimulation techniques. We argue that analyzing targeted stimulation dynamics can uncover mechanisms that are hidden during commonly analyzed spontaneous dynamics and explore how integrating diverse targeted stimulation experiments with existing generative models offer a significant opportunity to uncover these novel mechanisms and thereby expand our mechanistic understanding of brain dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Synaptic connectivity at the neuronal level is characterized by highly nonrandom features. Hypotheses about their role can be developed by correlating structural metrics to functional features. But, to prove causation, manipulations of connectivity would have to be studied. However, the fine-grained scale at which nonrandom trends are expressed makes this approach challenging to pursue experimentally. Simulations of neuronal networks provide an alternative route to study arbitrarily complex manipulations in morphologically and biophysically detailed models. Here, we present Connectome-Manipulator, a Python framework for rapid connectome manipulations of large-scale network models in Scalable Open Network Architecture TemplAte (SONATA) format. In addition to creating or manipulating the connectome of a model, it provides tools to fit parameters of stochastic connectivity models against existing connectomes. This enables rapid replacement of any existing connectome with equivalent connectomes at different levels of complexity, or transplantation of connectivity features from one connectome to another, for systematic study. We employed the framework in the detailed model of the rat somatosensory cortex in two exemplary use cases: transplanting interneuron connectivity trends from electron microscopy data and creating simplified connectomes of excitatory connectivity. We ran a series of network simulations and found diverse shifts in the activity of individual neuron populations causally linked to these manipulations.},

  abstract     = {Volumetric brain reconstructions provide an unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into the complex connectivity patterns of neurons in an increasing number of organisms. Here, we model and quantify the complexity of the resulting neural connectomes in the fruit fly, mouse, and human and unveil a simple set of shared organizing principles across these organisms. To put the connectomes in a physical context, we also construct contactomes, the network of neurons in physical contact in each organism. With these, we establish that physical constraints—either given by pairwise distances or the contactome—play a crucial role in shaping the network structure. For example, neuron positions are highly optimal in terms of distance from their neighbors. Yet, spatial constraints alone cannot capture the network topology, including the broad degree distribution. Conversely, the degree sequence alone is insufficient to recover the spatial structure. We resolve this apparent mismatch by formulating scalable maximum entropy models, incorporating both types of constraints. The resulting generative models have predictive power beyond the input data, as they capture several additional biological and network characteristics, like synaptic weights and graphlet statistics. We investigate the interplay of the spatial and topological structure of millimeter-scale neural connectomes in fly, mouse, and human. As a spatial observation, we demonstrate that the probability of synaptic connection decays exponentially with distance. Additionally, we show that the wiring length in neural connectomes is highly optimal. To quantify the physical constraints on synapse formation, we construct the physical contact network for each organism and demonstrate that contact edge probability follows the same exponential functional form as the connectome. At the same time, we show that spatial constraints are necessary but not sufficient to reconstruct the connectome topology. We present maximum-entropy models capturing key spatial and topological aspects of the connectomes and demonstrate their predictive power beyond the input data.},

  abstract     = {Our brains operate as a complex network of interconnected neurons. To gain a deeper understanding of this network architecture, it is essential to extract simple rules from its intricate structure. This study aimed to compress and simplify the architecture, with a particular focus on interpreting patterns of functional connectivity in 2.5 hr of electrical activity from a vast number of neurons in acutely sliced mouse brains. Here, we combined two distinct methods together: automatic compression and network analysis. Firstly, for automatic compression, we trained an artificial neural network named NNE (neural network embedding). This allowed us to reduce the connectivity to features, be represented only by 13% of the original neuron count. Secondly, to decipher the topology, we concentrated on the variability among the compressed features and compared them with 15 distinct network metrics. Specifically, we introduced new metrics that had not previously existed, termed as indirect-adjacent degree and neighbor hub ratio. Our results conclusively demonstrated that these new metrics could better explain approximately 40%–45% of the features. This finding highlighted the critical role of NNE in facilitating the development of innovative metrics, because some of the features extracted by NNE were not captured by the currently existed network metrics. Neural network embedding can compress large connectivity and has led to new metrics like indirect-adjacency degree and neighbor hub ratio.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the complex neural mechanisms underlying speech and music perception remains a multifaceted challenge. In this study, we investigated neural dynamics using human intracranial recordings. Employing a novel approach based on low-dimensional reduction techniques, the Manifold Density Flow (MDF), we quantified the complexity of brain dynamics during naturalistic speech and music listening and during resting state. Our results reveal higher complexity in patterns of interdependence between different brain regions during speech and music listening compared with rest, suggesting that the cognitive demands of speech and music listening drive the brain dynamics toward states not observed during rest. Moreover, speech listening has more complexity than music, highlighting the nuanced differences in cognitive demands between these two auditory domains. Additionally, we validated the efficacy of the MDF method through experimentation on a toy model and compared its effectiveness in capturing the complexity of brain dynamics induced by cognitive tasks with another established technique in the literature. Overall, our findings provide a new method to quantify the complexity of brain activity by studying its temporal evolution on a low-dimensional manifold, suggesting insights that are invisible to traditional methodologies in the contexts of speech and music perception. Understanding how the human brain processes speech and music is a fascinating and complex challenge. Our study explores how brain activity changes when people listen to naturalistic speech compared to when they listen to music or when they are at rest. We found that both speech and music engage the brain in more complex patterns of activity than rest, with speech leading to even greater complexity. To achieve this, we used a novel method to study the brain&#39;s activity in a simplified, low-dimensional space, representing the dynamical evolution of brain activity across different regions. This approach highlights the demands placed on brain function during the perception of speech and music, providing new insights into how we process these auditory experiences.},

  abstract     = {Advanced meditation consists of states and stages of practice that unfold with mastery and time. Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis of fMRI could identify brain states underlying advanced meditation. We conducted an intensive DFC case study of a meditator who completed 27 runs of jhāna advanced absorptive concentration meditation (ACAM-J), concurrently with 7-T fMRI and phenomenological reporting. We identified three brain states that marked differences between ACAM-J and nonmeditative control conditions. These states were characterized as a DMN-anticorrelated brain state, a hyperconnected brain state, and a sparsely connected brain state. Our analyses indicate higher prevalence of the DMN-anticorrelated brain state during ACAM-J than control states, and the prevalence increased significantly with deeper ACAM-J states. The hyperconnected brain state was also more common during ACAM-J and was characterized by elevated thalamocortical connectivity and somatomotor network connectivity. The hyperconnected brain state significantly decreased over the course of ACAM-J, associating with self-reports of wider attention and diminished physical sensations. This brain state may be related to sensory awareness. Advanced meditators have developed well-honed abilities to move in and out of different altered states of consciousness, and this study provides initial evidence that functional neuroimaging can objectively track their dynamics. Advanced meditation research investigates states and stages of practice that unfold with increasing mastery and time, which may include altered states of consciousness such as a diminished sense of self. In the current study, we examined a 7-T fMRI case study of jhāna , an advanced concentrative absorptive meditation (ACAM-J). Specifically, we examined the temporal properties of dynamic connectivity brain states that could reflect mental states and phenomena during ACAM-J. We identified two brain states that were more prevalent during ACAM-J than control conditions. One state, involving default-mode network anticorrelations with the rest of the brain, increased across ACAM-J. Another state, involving hyperconnectivity across many cortical networks, was correlated with reports of narrow attention and greater sensory awareness, as well as diminished across ACAM-J.},

  abstract     = {Distinct inhibitory cell types participate in cognitively relevant nested brain rhythms, and particular changes in such rhythms are known to occur in disease states. Specifically, the coexpression of theta and gamma rhythms in the hippocampus is believed to represent a general coding scheme, but cellular-based generation mechanisms for these coupled rhythms are currently unclear. We develop a population rate model of the CA1 hippocampus that encompasses circuits of three inhibitory cell types (bistratified cells and parvalbumin [PV]-expressing and cholecystokinin [CCK]-expressing basket cells) and pyramidal cells to examine this. We constrain parameters and perform numerical and theoretical analyses. The theory, in combination with the numerical explorations, predicts circuit motifs and specific cell-type mechanisms that are essential for the coexistence of theta and gamma oscillations. We find that CCK-expressing basket cells initiate the coupled rhythms and regularize theta, and PV-expressing basket cells enhance both theta and gamma rhythms. Pyramidal and bistratified cells govern the generation of theta rhythms, and PV-expressing basket and pyramidal cells play dominant roles in controlling theta frequencies. Our circuit motifs for the theta-gamma coupled rhythm generation could be applicable to other brain regions. There are many different types of inhibitory cells in our brains that are differentially affected in disease. Concomitantly, coupled rhythms change in particular ways with disease. To help understand cell-type-specific changes in coupled rhythms, we develop a mathematical network model that is both respective of the cell type and also amenable to analyses. We focus on theta-gamma coupled rhythms in the hippocampus and include three different inhibitory cell types in our model circuits. By combining a theoretical analysis and numerical explorations, we find distinct contributions of these inhibitory cell types to coupled rhythms and predict motifs that are essential for the expression of theta-gamma coupled rhythms. Moving forward, we can leverage our model insights to help unravel cell-type contributions in disease states.},

  abstract     = {The human brain is a complex system with high metabolic demands and extensive connectivity that requires control to balance energy consumption and functional efficiency over time. How this control is manifested on a whole-brain scale is largely unexplored, particularly what the associated costs are. Using the network control theory, here, we introduce a novel concept, time-averaged control energy (TCE), to quantify the cost of controlling human brain dynamics at rest, as measured from functional and diffusion MRI. Importantly, TCE spatially correlates with oxygen metabolism measures from the positron emission tomography, providing insight into the bioenergetic footing of resting-state control. Examining the temporal dimension of control costs, we find that brain state transitions along a hierarchical axis from sensory to association areas are more efficient in terms of control costs and more frequent within hierarchical groups than between. This inverse correlation between temporal control costs and state visits suggests a mechanism for maintaining functional diversity while minimizing energy expenditure. By unpacking the temporal dimension of control costs, we contribute to the neuroscientific understanding of how the brain governs its functionality while managing energy expenses. Understanding how the brain balances functional efficiency with energy conservation is a central question in neuroscience. The network control theory (NCT) views this question from a network perspective where the brain manages signal propagations along its structural connections to transition across desired activity states. Our study thus presents a novel framework based on the NCT to analyze the costs associated with transitioning across resting states, revealing that regions with high control costs on average are also metabolically demanding in terms of oxygen use. Our findings further show that transitions between sensory and association states are infrequent due to high control costs, while transitions within these states are more common. This suggests that the brain employs a mechanism to preserve functional diversity while minimizing energy costs.},

The method employs a recursive independent component analysis (ICA) strategy, leveraging information from a larger network to guide the extraction of information about smaller networks. We apply our model to the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), and right frontoparietal network (RFPN). We investigate further on the DMN by evaluating the difference between healthy people and individuals with schizophrenia. We show that the TICA approach can detect the spatial hierarchy of the DMN, VN, and RFPN. In addition, the TICA revealed DMN-associated group differences between cohorts that may not be captured if we focus on a single-scale ICA.

Here, we present a principled mathematical framework to quantify brain functional reconfiguration when engaging and disengaging from a stop signal task (SST). We apply tangent space projection (a Riemannian geometry mapping technique) to transform the functional connectomes (FCs) of 54 participants and quantify functional reconfiguration using the correlation distance of the resulting tangent-FCs. Our goal was to compare functional reconfigurations in individuals at risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We hypothesized that functional reconfigurations when transitioning to/from a task would be influenced by family history of AUD (FHA) and other AUD risk factors. Multilinear regression models showed that engaging and disengaging functional reconfiguration were associated with FHA and recent drinking. When engaging in the SST after a rest condition, functional reconfiguration was negatively associated with recent drinking, while functional reconfiguration when disengaging from the SST was negatively associated with FHA. In both models, several other factors contributed to the functional reconfiguration. This study demonstrates that tangent-FCs can characterize task-induced functional reconfiguration and that it is related to AUD risk. Human brain function constantly adapts to the external environment stimuli and transitions between cognitive states, which can be hindered by alcohol misuse and family history of alcohol use disorder (AUD). In this work, we used a novel methodology that applies Riemannian geometry concepts to functional connectivity to quantify functional reconfiguration of rest-to-task (engaging) and task-to-rest (disengaging) transitions. We ultimately aimed to determine the relationship between AUD risk factors and functional reconfiguration. Our findings showed that engaging functional reconfiguration was diminished in participants with a family history of AUD, whereas disengaging functional reconfiguration was diminished with greater recent drinking behavior. This study suggests that analysis of functional reconfiguration using Riemannian geometry is a promising avenue to better understand rest-to-task and task-to-rest brain transitions.},

  abstract     = {Computational modeling is a key tool for elucidating the neuronal mechanisms underlying epileptic activity. Despite considerable progress, existing models often lack realistic accuracy in representing electrophysiological epileptic activity. In this study, we used a comprehensive human brain model based on a neural mass model, which is tailored to the layered structure of the neocortex and incorporates patient-specific imaging data. This approach allowed the simulation of scalp EEGs in an epileptic patient suffering from type 2 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). The simulation specifically addressed epileptic activity induced by FCD, faithfully reproducing intracranial interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) recorded with electrocorticography. For constructing the patient-specific scalp EEG, we carefully defined a clear delineation of the epileptogenic zone by numerical simulations to ensure fidelity to the topography, polarity, and diffusion characteristics of IEDs. This nuanced approach improves the accuracy of the simulated EEG signal, provides a more accurate representation of epileptic activity, and enhances our understanding of the mechanism behind the epileptogenic networks. The accuracy of the model was confirmed by a postoperative reevaluation with a secondary EEG simulation that was consistent with the lesion’s removal. Ultimately, this personalized approach may prove instrumental in optimizing and tailoring epilepsy treatment strategies. This study aimed to create a neurophysiologically grounded computer model of focal epilepsy. This is a feature frequently lacking to simulations in this domain, making the translation from in silico to in vivo results questionable and difficult to understand for clinical electrophysiologists. We adapted a whole-brain neuronal mass model for EEG generation in various conscious states to replicate the EEG patterns of a type 2 focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a condition associated with epilepsy. Our model successfully simulated both intracranial and scalp EEGs of a complex patient with type 2 FCD, who was later cured through surgery. Importantly, the simulated lesion location matched the patient’s epileptogenic zone, and removing this area in the model eliminated epileptic activity in the EEG, demonstrating the model’s accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Aberrant thalamocortical connectivity occurs together with visual hallucinations in various pathologies and drug-induced states, highlighting the need to better understand how thalamocortical interactions may contribute to hallucinatory phenomena. Flicker light stimulation (FLS) at 10-Hz reliably and selectively induces transient visual hallucinations in healthy participants. Arrhythmic flicker elicits fewer hallucinatory effects while delivering equal amounts of visual stimulation, together facilitating a well-controlled experimental setup to investigate the neural correlates of visual hallucinations driven by flicker rhythmicity. Using rhythmic and arrhythmic FLS during fMRI scanning, we found that rhythmic FLS elicited stronger activation in higher order visual cortices compared with arrhythmic control. Consistently, we found that rhythmic flicker selectively increased connectivity between ventroanterior thalamic nuclei and higher order visual cortices, which was also positively associated with the subjective intensity of visual hallucinatory effects. As these thalamic and cortical areas do not receive primary visual inputs, it suggests that the thalamocortical connectivity changes relate to a higher order function of the thalamus, such as in the coordination of cortical activity. In sum, we present novel evidence for the role of specific thalamocortical interactions with ventroanterior nuclei within visual hallucinatory experiences. Importantly, this can inform future clinical research into the mechanistic underpinnings of pathologic hallucinations. Flicker light stimulation induces an intense transient experience of elementary visual hallucinations, such as colored geometric patterns, that has phenomenal similarities to the visual experience induced by psychedelic drugs or during psychopathology. During fMRI scanning, we found that increased connectivity between ventroanterior thalamic nuclei and higher order visual cortices was associated with the reported intensity of the flicker-induced visual effects. Our results suggest that the role of thalamocortical hyperconnectivity during hallucinatory experiences may relate to a higher order function of the thalamus, such as the regulation of cortical activity. This novel finding results from a highly controlled experimental setup, which can be extended to inform the mechanistic underpinnings of hallucinatory experiences during psychopathology.},
