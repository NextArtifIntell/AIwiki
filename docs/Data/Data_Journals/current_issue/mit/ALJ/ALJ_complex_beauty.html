  abstract     = {The evolution of living beings with continuous and consistent progress toward adaptation and ways to model evolution along principles as close as possible to Darwin’s are important areas of focus in Artificial Life. Though genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies are good methods for modeling selection, crossover, and mutation, biological systems are undeniably spatially distributed processes in which living organisms interact with locally available individuals rather than with the entire population at once. This work presents a model for the survival of organisms during a change in the environment to a less favorable one, putting them at risk of extinction, such as many organisms experience today under climate change or local habitat loss or fragmentation. Local spatial structure of resources and environmental quality also impacts the capacity of an evolving population to adapt. The problem is considered on a probabilistic cellular automaton with update rules based on the principles of genetic algorithms. To carry out simulations according to the described model, the Darwinian cellular automata are introduced, and the software has been designed with the code available open source. An experimental evaluation of the behavioral characteristics of the model was carried out, completed by a critical evaluation of the results obtained, parametrically describing conditions and thresholds under which extinction or survival of the population may occur.},

  abstract     = {We have discovered a novel transition rule for binary cellular automata (CAs) that yields self-replicating structures across two spatial and temporal scales from sparse random initial conditions. Lower-level, shape-shifting clusters frequently follow a transient attractor trajectory, generating new clusters, some of which periodically self-duplicate. When the initial distribution of live cells is sufficiently sparse, these clusters coalesce into larger formations that also self-replicate. These formations may further form the boundaries of an expanding complex on an even larger scale. This rule, dubbed “Outlier,” is rotationally symmetric and applies to 2-D Moore neighborhoods. It was evolved through genetic programming during an extensive search for rules that foster open-ended evolution in CAs. While self-replicating structures, both crafted and emergent, have been created in CAs with state sets intentionally designed for this purpose, the Outlier may be the first known rule to facilitate nontrivial emergent self-replication across two spatial scales in binary CAs.},

Over the last few decades, this line of Artificial Life research has since undergone several important developments. Although it experienced a relative dormancy of activity for a while, the recent rise of interest in open-ended evolution and the success of continuous cellular automata models have brought researchers’ attention back to how to make spatiotemporal patterns self-reproduce and evolve within spatially distributed computational media. This article provides a review of the relevant literature on this topic over the past 25 years and highlights the major accomplishments made so far, the challenges being faced, and promising future research directions.},

In this work, we study the dynamics of interacting random Boolean networks, focusing on attractor properties and response to perturbations. We observe that the properties of isolated critical Boolean networks are substantially maintained also in interaction settings, while interactions bias the dynamics of chaotic and ordered networks toward that of critical cells. The increase in attractors observed in multicellular scenarios, compared to single cells, allows us to hypothesize that biological processes, such as ontogeny and cell differentiation, leverage interactions to modulate individual and collective cell responses.},

  abstract     = {Distributed dynamical systems like cellular automata (CAs) and random boolean networks (RBNs) (and everything in between) have long been used as models to understand computation and self-replication in biology, morphogenesis, gene regulation, life-as-it-could-be, and the Universe.Such complex system models have been extensively studied mathematically and experimentally in all their different variations, such as synchronous and asynchronous updates and dynamic automata networks that can grow and change their structure, including components and interconnection topology, as well as their robustness.Wuensche (1994) investigated the basins of attraction of CAs and RBNs and even suggested that they are the “ghost in the machine.”Recent advances in such models, including continuous CAs, such as Lenia (Chan, 2019), and neural-based CAs (Mordvintsev et al., 2020), have been proposed as substrates to study the emergence of a more general intelligence (Gregor &amp;amp; Besse, 2021; Hamon et al., 2022), thanks to their propensity to support properties like self-organization, emergence, and open-endedness.But what can we learn from CAs and distributed dynamical system models about intelligence? And how can CAs and distributed dynamical system models be used to study the emergence of intelligence?To address such questions, we organized a workshop at the 2023 Artificial Life conference in Sapporo, Japan, that aimed to bridge the gap between the ALife community working with CAs and distributed dynamical systems and the broader artificial intelligence (AI) community interested in exploring concepts from complex systems, self-organization, and Artificial Life for AI research and machine learning.The workshop was named “The Distributed Ghost,” inspired by the Artificial Life conference theme “Ghost in the Machine.” The workshop program (Nichele et al., 2023) consisted of two invited keynotes, by Bert Chan and Andrea Roli, and a set of 10 abstract-based presentations. After the workshop, four high-quality contributions were extended as full papers and have been collected in this special issue.In “Cell-Cell Interactions: How Coupled Boolean Networks Tend to Criticality,” Braccini and coauthors investigate interacting RBNs as a theoretical model of multicellular biological systems with cell–cell interactions. They find not only that the interacting versions of RBNs show the same general trends of dynamical properties as their individual counterparts but also that the networks in ordered or chaotic regimes tend toward a critical regime when turned into interacting networks (while individually critical networks remain critical). This result suggests the importance of the interconnected nature of a distributed multicellular system for its system-level criticality (and thus biological functioning) as a whole.In “Emergence of Self-Replicating Hierarchical Structures in a Binary Cellular Automaton,” using genetic programming to explore the vast space of binary CAs (with Moore neighborhood and rotationally symmetric rule sets in two dimensions) for open-ended temporal evolution, Yang reports on the discovery of a novel CA rule, the “Outlier.” Most strikingly, this CA and therefore also its distinct chiral twin (obtained by mirroring the rule table) are unique among known models of self-replication in that structures exhibit replication across two different nested spatiotemporal scales. Moreover, the self-replicating structures appear from sparse random initial conditions and follow characteristic attractor trajectories involving such multiscale self-replication.In “Survival and Evolutionary Adaptation of Populations Under Disruptive Habitat Change: A Study With Darwinian Cellular Automata,” Derets and Nehaniv focus on the evolution of living beings, emphasizing continuous adaptation akin to Darwinian principles within the domain of Artificial Life. The introduced model addresses the survival of organisms amid environmental changes, particularly during transitions to less favorable conditions (modeled using percolation theory). A probabilistic CA is employed based on update rules derived from genetic algorithm principles. Finally, an experimental investigation of the model’s behavioral features is presented, analyzing parameters and thresholds governing population survival or extinction outcomes.In “Self-Reproduction and Evolution in Cellular Automata: 25 Years After Evoloops,” Sayama and Nehaniv offer a comprehensive review of advancements in CAs subjected to Darwinian evolution. The contribution marks the 25th anniversary of the seminal work on evoloops (Sayama, 1999). The review highlights significant developments, ongoing challenges, and prospective research avenues in Artificial Life, focusing on self-reproducing and evolving patterns in distributed computational environments.We are continuing the tradition of the “distributed series” in 2024 by organizing a special session named “The Distributed Viking” at the Artificial Life conference in Copenhagen, Denmark.

  abstract     = {Reproduction, development, and individual interactions are vital yet complex natural processes. Tierra (an ALife model proposed by Thomas Ray) and cellular automata, which can manage these aspects in a complex manner, are significantly limited in their ability to express morphology and behavior. In contrast, the virtual creatures proposed by Karl Sims have a considerably higher degree of freedom in terms of morphology and behavior. However, they also exhibit a limited capacity for processes like reproduction, development, and individual interactions. In addition, they employ genetic algorithms, which can result in a loss of biological diversity, as their implementation necessitates predefining a fitness function. Contrarily, the evolution of natural life is determined by mutation and natural selection, rather than by a human-defined fitness function. This study carefully extracts the characteristics of these models to propose a new Artificial Life model that can simulate reproduction, development, and individual interactions while exhibiting a high expressive power for morphology and behavior. The model is based on the concept of incorporating Tierra and cellular automata mechanisms into a cell that moves freely in 3-D space. In this model, no predefined fitness function or form that qualifies as a living creature exists. In other words, this approach can be rephrased as searching for persistent patterns, which is similar to the approach of Conway’s Game of Life. The primary objective of this study was to conduct a proof-of-concept demonstration to showcase the capabilities of this model. Guideless simulation by the proposed model using mutation and natural selection resulted in the formation of two types of creatures—dumbbell shaped and reticulated. These creatures exhibit intriguing features, exploiting the degrees of freedom inherent to the proposed model. Particularly noteworthy is their unique method of reproduction, which bears a striking resemblance to that of real organisms. These results reinforce the potential of this approach in modeling intricate processes observed in actual organisms and its ability to generate virtual creatures with intriguing ecologies.},

  abstract     = {It is very important to model the behavior of protocells as basic lifelike artificial organisms more and more accurately from the level of genomes to the level of populations. A better understanding of basic protocell communities may help us in describing more complex ecological systems accurately. In this article, we propose a new comprehensive, bilevel mathematical model of a community of three protocell species (one generalist and two specialists ). The aim is to achieve a model that is as basic/fundamental as possible while already displaying mutation, selection, and complex population dynamics phenomena (like competitive exclusion and keystone species). At the microlevel of genetic codes, the protocells and their mutations are modeled with Turing machines (TMs). The specialists arise from the generalist by means of mutation. Then the species are put into a common habitat, where, at the macrolevel of populations, they have to compete for the available nutrients, a part of which they themselves can produce. Because of different kinds of mutations, the running times of the species as TMs (algorithms) are different. This feature is passed on to the macrolevel as different reproduction times. At the macrolevel, a discrete-time dynamic model describes the competition. The model displays complex lifelike behavior known from population ecology, including the so-called competitive exclusion principle and the effect of keystone species. In future works, the bilevel model will have a good chance of serving as a simple and useful tool for studying more lifelike phenomena (like evolution) in their pure/abstract form.},

Tackling central themes of ALife, they study the emergence of persistent morphologies and the behaviors of mutant specialists and generalists competing for resources in a well-mixed environment.
