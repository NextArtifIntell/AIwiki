  abstract     = {This study distinguishes enterprises into high- and low-type categories based on enterprise value and cost efficiency, examining their strategic behaviors in three investment timing games: move simultaneously, the high-type enterprise moves first, and the low-type enterprise moves first. By comparing the three games, we find that both types of enterprises would always exert more effort in the sequential game than in the simultaneous game, and the later-move advantage makes both types of enterprises prefer to become the follower in the game. We also find that the enhanced cost efficiency advantage or enterprise value gap possessed by the high-type enterprise would widen the effort gap between the two types of enterprises, and enhance the low-type enterprise’s incentive to be the follower. Moreover, the existence of system vulnerability not only causes both types of enterprises to reduce their security effort that generates free-riding behaviors but also can first discourage and then encourage enterprises from moving in advance. We further propose a liability-based mechanism to tackle the free-riding problem. We reveal an exact optimal liability coefficient, whether in the simultaneous or sequential game and find that the high-type enterprise should undertake more compensation when its dominant position becomes more obvious and the low-type enterprise could therefore undertake decreased liability. Last, we extend the model to multiple enterprises and show that the results are robust.

  abstract     = {The ecological restoration of abandoned mines poses a significant challenge within China’s broader efforts toward the protection and restoration of the nation’s ecosystems. Based on the ecology-oriented development (EOD) model, a differential game framework for the ecological restoration of abandoned mines was constructed in this study, involving both government and corporate entities as players. Our analysis focused on various factors, including investment levels in ecological restoration quality, the quality of ecological restoration itself, investment levels in environmentally sensitive industry development, the quality of environmentally sensitive industries, environmentally sensitive product pricing strategies, and profit dynamics for both players across four distinct modes. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, extending the government’s concession period incentivizes enterprises to increase investment in both the quality of ecological restoration of abandoned mines and the development of environmentally sensitive industries. Second, the government should prefer the cooperative mode to introduce social capital for the ecology-oriented development of abandoned mines. Third, in noncooperative mode, for technology-intensive industries, the government’s industrial support policy is more mutually beneficial; conversely, for labor-intensive industries, the ecological restoration compensation policy yields higher mutual gains. Lastly, differentiated incentive policies implemented by the government across various modes prompt the input of enterprises in ecological restoration quality and environmentally sensitive industry development. Based on these findings, we offer specific policy recommendations to guide governmental efforts in promoting EOD for the ecological restoration of abandoned mines.

  abstract     = {Frugal materialism is a tendency of consumer demand to become more elastic in product durability in response to a tightening budget constraint. This paper proposes a value function-based model of frugal materialism and establishes a close theoretical link between frugal materialism and the slope of value satiation as defined in the decision analytic literature; for both their absolute and relative versions, frugal materialism and increasing value satiation are nearly equivalent to each other. Only some shapes of the value function are thus compatible with frugal materialism, and the shape restrictions involve concepts familiar from models of decision making under risk, even though the proposed model of frugal materialism does not involve any risk. Under the additional assumption of relative risk neutrality, the demand for risky assets of a frugally materialistic consumer should exhibit well-known behavioral patterns associated with increasing risk aversion, and there is only a narrow possibility for frugal materialism to coexist with precautionary saving behavior.},

  abstract     = {We imagine investors taking shares in an exogenous lognormal cash payoff with known parameters. Using a power utility (constant relative risk aversion (CRRA)) replica of Lintner’s static payoffs -based constant absolute risk aversion-normal capital asset pricing model, we examine how an investor’s expected utility is affected by the payoff parameters and surrounding market conditions. The market clearing asset price falls as a proportion of wealth when market wealth is higher, implying that CRRA investors hold a lower (rather than fixed) proportion of wealth in the risky asset when they are wealthier. Investors prefer conditions where they can obtain more risk, either because the risky payoff is exogenously riskier or competing investors want less. The equilibrium asset price is “disproportionately” lower when the asset is riskier, or when there are fewer willing buyers, leaving a better opportunity with higher expected utility.},

  abstract     = {The value of information is an important concept in decision analysis that has been quantified as the buying price ( BPI) for the information and the expected utility increase ( EUI) obtainable by using the information. These two measures rank information sources identically in a scalar-valued decision problem only when the utility function is linear or exponential. In contrast, this paper focuses on the value of information across scalar-valued decision problems sharing the same utility function such as different divisions within an organization exploring various information sources for their decisions using the same organizational utility function. In this context, it still makes sense to ask which sources are more informative. We show that BPI and EUI rank information sources identically in this context only when the utility function is linear . However, if the certainty equivalent increase is used instead of EUI , then identical ranking with BPI across problems is maintained for the broader class of linear or exponential utility functions. We discuss the importance of these results for distributed decision-making settings, where different departments within an organization may calculate the value of information separately. Our results advise against using EUI to measure information value in this context when risk attitude is important.},
