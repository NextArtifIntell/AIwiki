  abstract     = {Material adverse change (MAC) clauses and contingent earnouts are important contractual mechanisms used to protect acquirers from the risk of adverse selection. Yet, the extant literature has not sufficiently explored the antecedents of their use, in particular within the context of technology acquisitions. In this study, we take advantage of the passage of the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA), which disseminated information through the publication of patent applications, to explore the impact of innovation disclosures on the design of technology acquisition contracts. Consistent with the view that an increase in the availability of information related to the broader technological landscape reduces the need for contractual protections in acquisition contracts, our analysis demonstrates that deals disproportionately affected by AIPA have less expansive MAC clauses and are less likely to feature contingent earnouts. These results provide new evidence linking the use of MAC clauses and earnouts with acquisitions subject to information frictions.},

  abstract     = {Shifting economic circumstances may suggest some degree of resource redeployment of capacity-constrained capabilities. However, a separate question remains as to how corporate actors operate within the space of this economic logic. While prior literature on diversification has tended to highlight the fungibility of resources as a basis for their redeployment, we point to an additional consideration of the complementarity of resources that makes allocation within the firm attractive, what we term a “new best use.” Further, we point to a potential tension as the economic logic suggested by this property of complementarity, and more generally interdependence with the firm’s other resources and activities, may make assessing what constitutes what we term the “new best use” of a resource challenging. The latent fungibility of a resource may differ from the range of reliable assessment of relative value creation. The allocation of resources and capabilities across a firm of any scale or scope is generally guided by the organizational and task structure of the enterprise. Building on these arguments, we consider two classes of factors that might impact the realization of the latent opportunities of resource redeployment. One is the “pipes” of organizational structures and grouping of business units and allocation of decision rights of specific managers to those units, and the other is the “prisms” of the various metrics of performance and value creation that may make resource use across different domains of the business more or less comparable.},

(2025). How demand shocks “jumpstart” technological ecosystems and
commercialization: Evidence from the global electric vehicle industry.

  abstract     = {We examine how exogenous demand shocks overcome ecosystem bottlenecks in the commercialization of an emergent technology. We argue that demand shocks that spur new technology adoption by niche users pull “hub” firms into country technology markets, despite ecosystem bottlenecks, thereby serving to “jumpstart” the process of ecosystem development and technology commercialization. By analyzing global electric vehicle markets over the period 2008–2017, we find that extreme weather events such as abnormal heat-related events spur adoption of electric vehicles by end users, thereby propelling automotive or hub firms’ entry into country technology markets, and the subsequent shift of their electric vehicle product portfolios toward the more radical version of the technology. Notably, such demand shocks propel firms’ commercialization strategy, despite ecosystem bottlenecks such as the lack of regulatory and economic inducements for adoption, relative absence of complements, and product market differences. After entry, entrant firms’ electric vehicle product portfolios transition from hybrids toward radical technology products and investments in complements, albeit contingent on their competitive market position in the legacy technology. We discuss the implications of these findings concerning the uptake of demand shocks, and their robustness to modeling choices, technological generations across extended timeframes, potential mediating forces, and boundary conditions owing to firm and country-market heterogeneity.
