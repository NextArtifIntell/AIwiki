  abstract = {Because of a constant increase in the variety and number of parts required for assembly, part provision to the border of line requires careful orchestration. Therefore, every part must be assigned to the most suitable feeding policy, determining logistical in-house processes, presorting degree, and load carrier sizing. This assignment allows effective space management at the border of line while avoiding unnecessary intralogistics activities. Furthermore, timely part delivery necessitates decisions on vehicle type selection and delivery frequencies. In this research, we adapt an existing optimization model to the specific case of a machinery manufacturing company, validating the model for practical usage. The model aims to achieve cost minimization through optimal part feeding policy and vehicle type selection decisions, considering various constraints related to space availability at the border of line and the capacity of transportation vehicles. Our results reveal that the optimal assignment reduces costs by 56% compared with the company’s current assignment. Although the optimal assignment requires additional capacity investments for the company, we also test various restrictive solutions by adding practically relevant constraints. The latter still results in minimum cost savings of 23%, compared with the current assignment. Besides the cost benefits, the number of different line feeding policies is reduced. This streamlines the process, making it more conducive to automation. History: This paper was refereed. Funding: Financial support from Universiteit Gent is gratefully acknowledged.},

  abstract = {A preliminary estimation of construction costs is a crucial operation of any project related to civil engineering. An accurate estimation ensures a proper management of the available funds and helps the project managers in their decision-making processes. For instance, it is common that specific subtasks of the project are delegated to private subcontractors. Through a call for tenders, each eventual subcontractor has the opportunity to propose a bid with a price for supplying the service. Because the call is generally public, a competition may arise between subcontractors. This impacts the price proposed by the competitors to get the contract. In order to select a subcontractor, the project manager needs to have an accurate idea of a reasonable price for the subtask given. A price higher than expected is undesirable, but a price significantly lower than expected may also result in poor quality of service. The project manager must also be able to explain to stakeholders why a price is suited and justify why a specific subcontractor has been selected. Providing an estimation that is both accurate and transparent is a hard problem for the project manager. A growing trend is to leverage machine learning for this estimation, but designing a model that is both accurate and explainable is still a challenge. Another difficulty is that an approach that is accurate for estimating the cost of a subtask may not be efficient for another one. Based on this context, this paper introduces a framework for estimating construction costs while tackling both challenges. It is based on six machine learning models and on Shapley additive explanations. This project was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility, a public agency responsible for transport infrastructure in Quebec, Canada. Experiments were carried out on real data, covering historical road construction costs of 11,646 contracts and eight subtasks from 2014 to 2021. Results show that the framework is able to surpass the accuracy of human estimations by up to 31.56% while being able to adequately explain how the estimations have been obtained.

  abstract = {This study demonstrates the application of operations research techniques to enhance the operational efficiency of a large logistics network. The focus is on addressing a variant of the vehicle routing problem faced by Delhivery, a leading logistics company in India, to improve its midmile operations. The problem involves enhancing a complex distribution network with more than 3,000 locations, which can be closely described as a multidepot fleet size and mix site-dependent asymmetric distance-constrained vehicle routing problem with time windows. The study also considers the geographic scope of the network, which has not been previously explored in the literature. A novel mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented along with a powerful hybrid evolutionary search algorithm that has been tested in many real-world routing problems. Additionally, a novel insertion algorithm that significantly reduces computational time is introduced. Furthermore, the capabilities of the algorithm are expanded to determine the optimal locations for new hubs within Delhivery’s network. The proposed algorithm achieves significant cost savings of nearly 7.3% and offers various managerial advantages. The algorithm converges rapidly and automates the entire planning and operations process, resulting in improved overall efficiency. History: This paper was refereed.},

  abstract = {Framework agreements (FAs) are procurement mechanisms used in private and public organizations by which a central procurement agency selects an assortment of products, typically through auctions, and then affiliated organizations can purchase from the selected assortment as needs arise. In Chile’s central procurement agency (ChileCompra), FAs accounted for 23% of the procurement expenditures during 2018–2019. However, descriptive analysis of purchase transaction data suggests that some FAs exhibited low levels of competition in the auctions used to select the suppliers, which could potentially result in larger government expenditures. We collaborated with ChileCompra to redesign FAs to enhance competition introducing two important changes: (i) standardize the product catalog using natural language processing algorithms and (ii) use this product standardization to induce more competition in the auctions to select suppliers. These changes were implemented through an experimental approach in a redesigned food FA to measure its impact, showing that inducing more intense competition in the auction stage reduced transaction prices by 8%. This pilot study ultimately led ChileCompra to implement a similar design in all its FAs, and many of the improvements in the design of the FAs were included in the new regulation on government purchases. If we were to extrapolate the savings from our pilot redesign to all these FAs, the total savings would amount to around $74 million in 2022. History: This paper was refereed.
