  abstract     = {This case centers around the dilemma faced by the female owner of a balloon decoration business: whether to outsource transportation of balloon arrangements to third-party providers or handle the transportation of some orders in house. The case illustrates a path to answering the strategic business question through solving a sequence of vehicle routing problems (VRPs) of increasing complexity. The focus of the case is not only on solving VRPs, but also on teaching a practical framework for (1) framing a business problem as a prescriptive analytics problem; (2) researching appropriate concepts, prior publications, and tools; (3) setting up an optimization problem formulation, estimating the necessary inputs, and obtaining a solution; (4) deciding on the appropriate level of formulation complexity needed; and (5) mapping the results from the models to a response to the original business question. Realistic data and Excel models and are provided. The case is appropriate for use in courses in optimization, operations research, and business analytics at either the advanced undergraduate or master’s/MBA level.

What might those things look like if carried out using Python? We describe a teaching module in which Python is used to do typical Excel-based modeling and data-wrangling tasks. In addition, students are exposed to basic software engineering principles, including project folder structures, version control, object-oriented programming, and other more advanced Python skills, creating deployable packages and documentation. The module is supported with Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, course web pages that include numerous screencasts, and a few GitHub repositories.

  abstract     = {Multiple studies call for engineering education to integrate social justice into classroom instruction. Yet, there is uncertainty regarding whether integrating these social topics into engineering curriculum will support or detract from the learning of technical concepts. This study focuses on evaluating how reframing technical assessments to include social justice concepts impacts student learning and investigates how well students integrate social justice into engineering decision making. Using a within-subject design, in which students were exposed to both conditions (questions with and without social justice context), we evaluate how social justice framing impacts overall student learning of technical topics. Social justice prompts are added to homework questions, and we assess students’ demonstration of knowledge of original technical content of the course, as well as their ability to consider social justice implications of engineering design. In the earlier homework assignment, the experimental group showed a significant decrease in learning when technical concepts were framed to include social justice. As the students became more familiar with social justice considerations, their learning of technical concepts became comparable to that of students who did not have the social justice components in their assignment. Their evaluation of the social implications of technical decisions also improved.

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected higher education institutions worldwide as they had to switch from face-to-face to online teaching almost overnight. This abrupt change made a huge impact on teaching, learning, and particularly, student engagement. This paper focuses on online social presence as an element of student engagement, which represents how students feel under synchronous online teaching. A survey was conducted among 244 first-year students to evaluate the impact of online social interaction, online collaboration, online contact with staff, online engagement, and online active learning on online social presence. Structural equation modeling was used to test and evaluate these multivariate relationships. Our study illustrates that all variables have a significant positive relationship with online social presence. In particular, online social interaction and online collaboration show a more powerful relationship with student online social presence. Thus, digital technologies should be adopted in a way that encourages students to actively interact with their peers.},

  abstract     = {This case study introduces students to the decision-making process of a facility location problem and requires them to apply appropriate methods to recommend a desirable terminal location for CBT, a transportation provider in the United States. In response to the increasing number of drivers in the Texas market, CBT explored different options to better serve the rising demand, including a new and second terminal in a different geographic area. Students employ multi-criteria decision-making framework and optimization modeling to support their analysis using empirical data. While students use provided data to solve the problem in the base case, they need to research various publicly available databases in the case extension. This case can be used in undergraduate courses in logistics, transportation, operations, and supply chain management to apply facility location related concepts, or in a business analytics course to illustrate optimization modeling in a real-world context.
