  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper investigates how a crowdfunding campaign’s voluntary disclosure of sensitive cost information affects its funding performance on Kickstarter—a mainstream, primarily reward-based crowdfunding platform. Instead of enhancing a campaign’s marketing traits, project budget as a novel information-provision tool reminds the crowd of the behind-the-scenes operations for developing and executing a project. This resembles the radical practice of cost transparency recently observed in the retail industry and studied experimentally in the literature. We also separate the disclosure effect on reward seeking versus altruistic pledges and examine how it varies with the structure of the cost items (fixed versus variable costs). Methodology/results : Our data collection follows Kickstarter’s rollout of the Project Budget tool in 2019. The project-level raw data are preprocessed via coarsened exact matching to match projects with and without budgets. We show that the main channel through which budget provision improves funding performance is via attracting additional funding, not by cannibalizing competing projects. Because of the voluntary nature of budget provision, we address the resulting endogeneity issue using peer average-style instruments. Budget provision on average increases funding performance by over 100%, which is more effective than many information-provision tools studied. Interestingly, this funding improvement comes from an increased number of backers (width), not from a higher pledge per backer (depth), and from a considerably higher number of altruistic pledges, not from more reward-seeking pledges. Further, a higher fixed-cost (over total cost) ratio, which is indicative of a higher profit margin, significantly reduces the benefit but does not make disclosure backfire. Managerial implications : Showing the costs to customers can be highly effective in business settings where trust between stakeholders is critical, which implies a promising generalization to donation-based crowdfunding. Our results can also be used to guide a sequential rollout of the Project Budget feature across campaign categories and promote adoption rates. Funding: X.

  abstract     = {Problem Definition: Proficiency in many sophisticated tasks is attained through experience-based learning, in other words, learning by doing. For example, transplant centers’ surgical teams need to practice difficult surgeries to master the skills required. Meanwhile, this experience-based learning may affect other stakeholders, such as patients eligible for transplant surgeries, and require resources, including scarce organs and continual efforts. To ensure that patients have excellent outcomes and equitable access to organs, the organ allocation authority needs to quickly identify and develop medical teams with high aptitudes. This entails striking a balance between exploring surgical combinations with initially unknown full potential and exploiting existing knowledge based on observed outcomes. Methodology/results: We formulate a multi-armed bandit (MAB) model in which parametric learning curves are embedded in the reward functions to capture endogenous experience-based learning. In addition, our model includes provisions ensuring that the choices of arms are subject to fairness constraints to guarantee equity. To solve our MAB problem, we propose the L-UCB and FL-UCB algorithms, variants of the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm that attain the optimal O ( log t ) regret on problems enhanced with experience-based learning and fairness concerns. We demonstrate our model and algorithms on the split liver transplantation (SLT) allocation problem, showing that our algorithms have superior numerical performance compared with standard bandit algorithms in a setting where experience-based learning and fairness concerns exist. Managerial implications: From a methodological point of view, our proposed MAB model and algorithms are generic and have broad application prospects. From an application standpoint, our algorithms could be applied to help evaluate potential strategies to increase the proliferation of SLT and other technically difficult procedures.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a nurse staffing problem under random nurse demand and absenteeism. Although the demand uncertainty is exogenous, the absenteeism uncertainty is decision-dependent , that is, the number of nurses who show up for work partially depends on the nurse staffing level. For quality of care, hospitals develop float pools of hospital units and train nurses to be able to work in multiple units (termed cross-training) in response to potential nurse shortages. Methodology/results : We study a distributionally robust nurse staffing (DRNS) model that considers both exogenous and decision-dependent uncertainties. We derive a separation algorithm to solve this model under a general structure of float pools. In addition, we identify several pool structures that often arise in practice and recast the corresponding DRNS model as a mixed-integer linear program, which facilitates off-the-shelf commercial solvers. Managerial implications : Through the numerical case studies, based on the data of a collaborating hospital, we found that modeling decision-dependent absenteeism improves the out-of-sample performance of staffing decisions, and such improvement is positively correlated with the value of flexibility arising from fully utilizing float pools.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Women have been shown to prefer jobs with a better work-life balance across many fields. Given that serving as a state political representative requires a significant amount of travel between one’s home district and the state capitol, this suggests that long commute distances may reduce the number of women seeking political office in the United States. At the same time, state political positions vary in their degree of flexibility (e.g., full-time versus part-time) and commensurate compensation, which could make them more or less desirable to women. We analyze the extent to which longer commute distances deter female political participation and whether this effect varies according to the degree of flexibility and commensurate compensation provided by the position. Furthermore, we investigate policies that can lower the barrier to entry for women in politics. Methodology/results : Leveraging differences in distance to the state capitol among state legislative districts, we show that districts located further from the state capitol in states with full-time legislatures have a lower percentage of female candidates, whereas in states with part-time legislatures, the opposite is true. The effect in hybrid states, that is, those state legislatures with a workload between part-time and full-time, appears to be slightly negative or neutral. We then conduct two conjoint survey experiments administered to a pool of college students and past political candidates to understand how policies allowing for paid parental leave, remote work/proxy voting, or daycare benefits in political positions could help to close the gender gap in politics. We find that paid parental leave might motivate women at the beginning of their political careers with longer commutes to run for office while a remote work/proxy voting policy could help to sustain the political careers of these types of women. Managerial implications : For organizers and policymakers seeking to encourage more women to run for office, our work shows that commute distance is a barrier for would-be candidates in states with full-time legislatures and that making paid parental leave and remote work/proxy voting available may help.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we compare laissez-faire and mandatory authorization policy regimes for third-party remanufacturing. Under a laissez-faire policy, an independent remanufacturer (IR) chooses whether to get the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) authorization. Under a mandatory authorization policy, the IR is required to get OEM authorization and to pay the OEM a fee for every item remanufactured. Motivated by China’s regulatory journey that first mandated authorized remanufacturing and then moved to a laissez-faire policy, our goal is to understand which policy is better from the perspectives of different stakeholders. Methodology/results : We use a game-theoretic approach and consider a supply chain consisting of a supplier, an OEM, and an IR under the two policy regimes. Conventional wisdom suggests that the IR would be better off under the laissez-faire policy, but the OEM and the supplier would be better off under the mandatory authorization policy. However, we show that this conventional wisdom may not hold. For products with a low remanufacturing cost, all firms benefit from the mandatory authorization policy, whereas for products with a moderately high remanufacturing cost, all firms are better off under the laissez-faire policy. Further, mandatory authorization may outperform the laissez-faire policy in both economic and environmental dimensions. Managerial implications : Our findings reveal that seemingly advantageous policy regimes may backfire for firms. Therefore, before supporting such policies, the firms need to assess the strategic reactions of other firms and the potential impacts on their profits. Furthermore, a mandatory authorization policy can be beneficial in fostering the development of the remanufacturing sector for products with low remanufacturing costs. Nevertheless, it may also lead to an increase in the total environmental impact. Funding: The work of M.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : It is well known that the power sector requires flexibility, especially from fossil fuel–based power-generating units, to balance demand side variability and supply side fluctuations. However, the environmental consequences related to possessing and exercising such flexibility remain relatively unexplored. In this study, we examine the environmental impact of two forms of flexibility pertinent to power generation: fuel flexibility —that is, the ability to utilize multiple fuel types, and volume flexibility —that is, the ability to alter production volumes quickly. Methodology/results : We assembled a data set that spans 1998–2016 and includes details on fuel usage, power generation, generating unit characteristics, and carbon dioxide (i.e., CO 2 ) emissions for 3,135 fossil fuel power-generating units that account for more than 92% of the United States’ fossil fuel–generating capacity. Our empirical analysis reveals that power-generating units that possess fuel flexibility or volume flexibility generate greater CO 2 emissions than comparable nonflexible generating units. Additionally, when power-generating units exercise fuel flexibility (i.e., they use multiple fuel types in a period) or volume flexibility (i.e., they vary production to a greater degree in a period), they generate greater CO 2 emissions. By contrast, when power-generating units exercise both fuel and volume flexibility, we find that they diminish the aggregate emissions increases expected from exercising fuel or volume flexibility alone. Managerial implications : We add to the literature by exploring how flexibility affects environmental performance and by disambiguating the effects of possessing flexibility and exercising flexibility. These results are important when considering the penetration of renewables, the adoption of utility-grade storage, and demand response as each of these paths can significantly affect the flexibility burden placed on conventional sources of power. Thus, our results are relevant to policy makers and practitioners because they crystallize the environmental tradeoffs involved with deploying flexibility in fossil fuel–based power-generating units.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The asymmetric pull-to-center effect for newsvendors is a robust finding in operations, and understanding why newsvendors make suboptimal decisions is key for identifying ways to improve decision-making quality in this critical task. Although prior studies have indicated that experience does not substantially mitigate the pull-to-center effect, the experience levels achieved in those previous studies are limited in comparison with the experience level that a near-continuous time environment can provide. Methodology/results : We conduct a set of laboratory experiments using a near-continuous time environment to determine the effect that extensive experience has on newsvendor behavior and the extent to which resultant learning is transferable across conditions. Observed behavior clearly demonstrates that the pull-to-center effect is substantially reduced, if not eliminated, with sufficient experience and that this learning can have positive spillovers to more traditional settings. Further, the experiments suggest that it is the repeated feedback regarding a given inventory decision rather than the ability to explore many strategies that drives improved decision making. Managerial implications : Experience can mitigate the pull-to-center effect, and near-continuous time environments can be an effective training tool for gaining such experience.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a feature-based pricing problem with demand censoring in an offline, data-driven setting. In this problem, a firm is endowed with a finite amount of inventory and faces a random demand that is dependent on the offered price and the features (from products, customers, or both). Any unsatisfied demand that exceeds the inventory level is lost and unobservable. The firm does not know the demand function but has access to an offline data set consisting of quadruplets of historical features, inventory, price, and potentially censored sales quantity. Our objective is to use the offline data set to find the optimal feature-based pricing rule so as to maximize the expected profit. Methodology/results : Through the lens of causal inference, we propose a novel data-driven algorithm that is motivated by survival analysis and doubly robust estimation. We derive a finite sample regret bound to justify the proposed offline learning algorithm and prove its robustness. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robust performance of our proposed algorithm in accurately estimating optimal prices on both training and testing data. Managerial implications : The work provides practitioners with an innovative modeling and algorithmic framework for the feature-based pricing problem with demand censoring through the lens of causal inference.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine how to manage turnover among drivers delivering parcels for last-mile platforms. Although driver attrition in these platforms is both commonplace and costly, there is little understanding of the processes responsible for this phenomenon. Methodology/results : We collaborate with a platform to build a structural model to estimate the effects of key predictors of drivers’ decisions to leave or remain at the platform. For this estimation, we apply a dynamic discrete-choice framework in a two-step procedure that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity among drivers while circumventing the use of approximation or reduction methods commonly used to solve dynamic choice problems in the operations management domain. Drivers are compensated using a combination of regular payments that reward their productivity and subsidy payments that support them as they gain experience on the job. We find that regular pay has a greater effect on drivers’ retention. Furthermore, the marginal effects of both regular and subsidy pay diminish with drivers’ tenure at the platform, but the latter diminishes faster than the former. Additionally, we find significant heterogeneity among drivers in their unobserved nonpecuniary taste for the jobs at the platform and a significantly greater probability of retention among drivers with greater taste for these jobs. Managerial implications : Platforms can leverage our results to improve driver retention and design more profitable payment policies. We perform counterfactual analyses and develop a modeling framework to guide platforms toward this goal. Funding: This study was partially funded by a grant from TForce Logistics.

We analyze (a) customers’ heterogeneous search and purchase behaviors and (b) their reactions to changes in assortment size. We then develop a consider-then-choose model to generalize our findings. Methodology/results : We characterize the online customer journey as a two-stage consider-then-choose framework. In the consider stage, we analyze the consideration set formation and show that heterogeneity—familiarity with the assortment—amplifies the number of options; in the purchase stage, it drives preferences for niche versus popular choices. A real-world high-stakes field experiment reveals that shrinking the menu produces mixed results: highlighting the market for the long-tail for some customers and reflecting choice overload for others. Finally, we build a psychologically rich consider-then-choose model with (a) heterogeneous preferences for product features and (b) heterogeneous search costs moderated by search fatigue, theoretically characterizing the impact on consideration sets and conversion rates. Managerial implications : Identifying frictions in the shopping funnel is critical for online platforms, especially when pain points hurt click-through or conversion rates. Which options matter to which users? What is the right assortment size? Although online platforms can offer virtually unlimited assortments, managers may assume frictionless environments—which is not always the case.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Short video format platforms like NetEase and TikTok are attention economies that host user-generated content, in the form of combined video and audio elements, and operate on principles of network virality. This study explores user content creation strategies by focusing on decisions around content release frequency and the incorporation of adopted content in newly generated creations. Methodology/results : We theoretically explore the role of the following three mechanisms influencing these decisions: (a) social hierarchies in the platform’s network structure, (b) virality of content on the platform, and (c) algorithmic interventions through the ranking of content recommendations. To empirically study these relationships, we use a detailed log of user activity on NetEase Cloud Village registered during the month of November 2019 and carry out regression-based analyses. We find that high-status users, measured through their follower count, adapt their content release frequency strategically, slowing down after successful content to avoid dilution of potential virality. We also observe that high-status users generally deviate from prevailing viral trends in their content creation. However, following exceptionally successful releases, they tend to conform more to viral content, suggesting a risk-averse approach. Finally, contrary to algorithm aversion, users prefer content recommended by the platform. However, high-status users disregard algorithms to retain agency in decision making. Managerial implications : Our findings provide a holistic understanding of the content creation process and suggest that platforms could strategically adjust algorithmic ranking policies to foster content creation diversity while catering to the preferences of users with different status levels.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the impact of an airline’s route-level decisions on the efficiency and resilience of its operations. Methodology/results : Our study uses a proprietary passenger-level data set provided by Southwest Airlines and takes advantage of a regulatory change, the Wright Amendment repeal. The Wright Amendment restricted nonstop service between Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL) and most major destinations. Its repeal led to significant changes in Southwest’s service offerings at DAL. We use a difference-in-differences framework to quantify the impact of the repeal on the scheduled travel times and long travel delays at the passenger level, which serve as proxies for efficiency and resilience, respectively. We show that the repeal’s impact varies widely across destinations. Although Southwest introduced nonstop service to some destinations but not others after the repeal, this decision alone does not sufficiently explain the observed heterogeneity. As such, we develop two route-level metrics—route inefficiency and route resilience—to explain the heterogeneous impact of the repeal on different destinations. Moreover, our counterfactual analysis shows that reallocating connecting passengers with small itinerary buffers to alternative itineraries can result in major resilience improvements without significantly deteriorating efficiency. Managerial implications : Our findings are robust to alternative empirical specifications and have important implications for practitioners and regulators. Specifically, our study not only sheds light on the operational consequences of airlines’ route-level decisions but also demonstrates how managers can effectively manage the efficiency-resilience tradeoff for connecting passengers. Our study also implies that regulators can add more transparency to airline operations by providing public access to passenger-level data.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Improving the surplus of low-income consumers during economic distress is of primary concern for many governments. This paper uses an economic model to investigate consumers’ brand switching during economic distress and highlights its disparate impact on low-income consumers. Our modeling framework also captures how retailers and national-brand manufacturers strategically adjust the market prices in response to brand switching and shelf space constraints. To generate prescriptive insights, we also analyze the effectiveness of commonly observed government interventions that fall into two major categories: (i) consumer-focused (e.g., cash subsidy) and (ii) retailer-focused (e.g., price control). Methodology/results : Our analysis indicates that market access for low-income consumers can decline significantly because of the brand switching behavior. Furthermore, not all government interventions are equally effective in increasing the welfare of low-income consumers. In fact, retailer-focused schemes such as price control (PC) can backfire and decrease access for low-income consumers. Although cash subsidy (CS) can increase the surplus of low-income consumers, it is always at the expense of high-income consumers. Managerial implications : We study an important but understudied challenge that highlights how strategic behavior by retailers can exacerbate affordability and accessibility concerns during economic distress. Model calibration using NielsenIQ Homescan Panel data shows that our model captures the data well and generates practical insights for policymakers. These results suggest that the success of government interventions depends critically on whether they account for the strategic behavior of different stakeholders in the supply chain.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Cloud computing is a multibillion-dollar business that draws substantial capital investments from large companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Large cloud providers need to accommodate the growing demand for computing resources while avoiding unnecessary overprovisioning of hardware and operational costs. The underlying decision processes are challenging, as they involve long-term hardware and infrastructure investments under future demand uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce the cloud server deployment problem . One important aspect of the problem is that the infrastructure preparation work has to be planned for before server deployments can take place. Furthermore, a combination of temporal constraints has to be considered together with a variety of physical constraints. Methodology/results : We formulate the underlying optimization problem as a two-stage stochastic program. After carefully examining the demand data and on-the-ground deployment operations, we distill two structural properties on deployment throughput constraints and provide tightness results on a convex relaxation of the second stage. Based on that, we develop efficient cutting-plane methods that exploit the special structure of the problem and can accommodate different risk measures. We test our algorithms with real production traces from Microsoft Azure and demonstrate sizeable cost reductions. We show empirically that the algorithms remain optimal even when the two properties are not fully satisfied. Managerial implications : Cloud supply chain operations were largely executed manually due to their complexity and dynamic nature. In this paper, we show that the key decision processes can be systematically optimized. In particular, we demonstrate that accounting for the stochastic nature of demands results in substantial cost reductions in cloud server deployments. Another benefit of our stochastic optimization approach is the ability to seamlessly integrate configurable risk preferences of cloud providers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The rise of digital channels has led to significant media market transformations. This paper studies whether and how digitization, sparked by the launch of Amazon Kindle in late 2007, affected print book sales. Methodology/results: To estimate the impact, we exploit the quasiexperimental variation in the popularity of digital books across different genres or subgenres. We employ difference-in-differences and other identification strategies, and we use print sales data on a large representative sample of book titles published in the United States from 2004 to 2015 across a variety of genres. Using various empirical specifications, we find that digitization significantly reduced print sales of adult fiction (the most popular genre in the e-book format) while having a much smaller impact on adult nonfiction and juvenile fiction. We further find that the effect for adult fiction is higher after the launch of the iPad (in 2010) and stronger for smaller publishers, the paperback version, and low-selling books. Managerial implications : Our findings provide book publishers with key inputs for optimal pricing and release strategies of different book formats. Our study also extends the vast yet growing academic literature on the impact of digital distribution channels on existing sales channels and can inform the policy debate concerning third-party digitization and its effect on physical sales.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The joint assortment and pricing problem is notoriously difficult to solve, especially for large-scale issues subject to various operational constraints arising from business practices. In this paper, we delve into the joint optimization challenge under constrained logit choice models, accounting for product-differentiated price sensitivities across static, randomized, and dynamic contexts. Methodology/results : We develop a unified optimization methodology that applies efficient frontier and dimensional reduction and transforms the joint optimization problem into a single-variable one with respect to the total choice probability. The efficient frontier is employed to transform the nonconcave objective function equivalently into its concave counterpart. We show that the optimal prices are uniquely determined by the common target adjusted markup. The complexity of the mixed combinatorial optimization problem can be reduced by searching over efficient sets of polynomial size. In the randomized assortment and pricing problem in which the product offer sets and prices follow certain distribution, we show that randomization has the potential to elevate the total revenue to the exact efficient frontier, a feat that the static problem may fail to achieve (with a given total choice probability). For dynamic joint product selection and pricing, we find that the optimal policy adopts a simple time-threshold structure that can be precomputed. Furthermore, we illustrate the robustness of our methodology by extending the analysis to a variety of general settings, including the nested logit model. Managerial implications : The proposed methodology contributes to the increasingly popular topic in retail management by significantly reducing the computational complexity of joint product offering and pricing under different constraints. Our results regarding the effects of product set constraints and price bounds provide valuable insights and guidance to practitioners on product offering and pricing in various business scenarios.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for optimizing long-term discounted reward problems with large combinatorial action space and state dependent constraints. These characteristics are common to many operations management problems, for example, network inventory replenishment, where managers have to deal with uncertain demand, lost sales, and capacity constraints that results in more complex feasible action spaces. Our proposed programmable actor RL (PARL) uses a deep-policy iteration method that leverages neural networks to approximate the value function and combines it with mathematical programming and sample average approximation to solve the per-step-action optimally while accounting for combinatorial action spaces and state-dependent constraint sets. Methodology/results : We then show how the proposed methodology can be applied to complex inventory replenishment problems where analytical solutions are intractable. We also benchmark the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art RL algorithms and commonly used replenishment heuristics and find that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms existing methods by as much as 14.7% on average in various complex supply chain settings. Managerial implications : We find that this improvement in performance of PARL over benchmark algorithms can be directly attributed to better inventory cost management, especially in inventory constrained settings. Furthermore, in the simpler setting where optimal replenishment policy is tractable or known near optimal heuristics exist, we find that the RL-based policies can learn near optimal policies. Finally, to make RL algorithms more accessible for inventory management researchers, we also discuss the development of a modular Python library that can be used to test the performance of RL algorithms with various supply chain structures. This library can spur future research in developing practical and near-optimal algorithms for inventory management problems.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly leveraged in business and consumer decision-making processes. Because LLMs learn from human data and feedback, which can be biased, determining whether LLMs exhibit human-like behavioral decision biases (e.g., base-rate neglect, risk aversion, confirmation bias, etc.) is crucial prior to implementing LLMs into decision-making contexts and workflows. To understand this, we examine 18 common human biases that are important in operations management (OM) using the dominant LLM, ChatGPT. Methodology/results : We perform experiments where GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 act as participants to test these biases using vignettes adapted from the literature (“standard context”) and variants reframed in inventory and general OM contexts. In almost half of the experiments, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) mirrors human biases, diverging from prototypical human responses in the remaining experiments. We also observe that GPT models have a notable level of consistency between the standard and OM-specific experiments as well as across temporal versions of the GPT-3.5 model. Our comparative analysis between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 reveals a dual-edged progression of GPT’s decision making, wherein GPT-4 advances in decision-making accuracy for problems with well-defined mathematical solutions while simultaneously displaying increased behavioral biases for preference-based problems. Managerial implications : First, our results highlight that managers will obtain the greatest benefits from deploying GPT to workflows leveraging established formulas. Second, that GPT displayed a high level of response consistency across the standard, inventory, and non-inventory operational contexts provides optimism that LLMs can offer reliable support even when details of the decision and problem contexts change. Third, although selecting between models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, represents a trade-off in cost and performance, our results suggest that managers should invest in higher-performing models, particularly for solving problems with objective solutions.

We highlight the role of transparency in driving positive DEI change in publicly traded companies, which are also more likely to benefit from DEI initiatives because of their greater access to the resources required for implementation and a higher degree of customization. We describe additional barriers to DEI implementation, by which the differences between company types are less certain.
