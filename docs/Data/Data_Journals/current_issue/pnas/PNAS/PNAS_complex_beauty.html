  abstract     = {Stromatoporoid sponges were important reef-builders during the middle Paleozoic, yet their early history and integration into reef ecosystems remain poorly understood. Here, we report Lophiostroma leizunia Jeon sp. nov., the oldest known stromatoporoid from upper Tremadocian to lower Floian (~480 My-old) strata of South China. L. leizunia formed complex reef structures, playing crucial roles in framework construction and binding other components, including calcimicrobes, lithistid sponges, stalked echinoderms, and Calathium . This discovery pushes back the fossil record of stromatoporoids and the reefs that they formed by approximately 20 My, advancing the onset of the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event in reef evolution. L. leizunia unusually constructed its skeleton using fluorapatite—a feature previously unknown in sponges. This establishes Porifera as the first metazoan phylum known to have utilized all three principal biominerals: silica, calcium carbonate, and calcium phosphate. The presence of phosphatic skeletons in this early stromatoporoid expands our understanding of biomineralization capabilities in early animals and suggests that the genetic toolkit for diverse biomineralization strategies may have been present in early sponges. The unique combination of the earliest known reef-building stromatoporoids and their phosphatic skeletal composition provides insights into the evolutionary dynamics of biomineralization and the rise of metazoan-dominated reef ecosystems during a critical period of Earth’s history.},

(2025). Enamel–dentine junction morphology reveals population
replacement and mobility in the late prehistoric middle nile valley.

  abstract     = {Transitions from foraging to food-production represent a worldwide turning point in recent human history. In the Middle Nile Valley this cultural shift occurred between the sixth and beginning of the fifth millennium BCE. Significant craniodental morphological differences remain inadequately tested by biometric analyses of ancestry and may reflect population origins or diet change between the last hunter-fisher-gatherers (Mesolithic) and first food-producers (Neolithic). Moreover, with no ancient DNA data for this region and very few morphological studies including large samples of Mesolithic individuals, the late prehistoric population history of the Nile Valley remains unclear. Here, we present enamel–dentine junction (EDJ) morphological analyses (based on X-ray microtomography) and biological affinities for 88 individuals spanning 14,000 y from Sudan and southern Egypt. Significant EDJ morphological differences between the last foragers and first food-producers suggest major biological discontinuity at the Neolithic transition. Nevertheless, the persistence of the earlier forager population in the Sudanese Eastern Sahara indicates settlement and population replacement mainly along the Nile. We also present biological evidence of interaction and mobility between these contemporaneous populations during the middle Holocene in the region. It supports the phylogenetic value of EDJ morphology for investigating population affinities at a microevolutionary scale. These results yield insights into the deep population history of the Nile Valley. They provide firm evidence for population replacement and migration toward the region at the onset of the Neolithic transition, attesting that these key changes were not solely triggered by cultural diffusion and diet change.},
