  abstract     = {Constrained Many-objective Optimization Problems (CMaOPs) are challenging in handling objectives and constraints simultaneously. Here, a novel Constrained Many-objective Optimization Evolutionary Algorithm (CMaOEA) based on Multi-population, Knowledge transfer and Improved environmental selection called CMaMKI is proposed to handle CMaOPs. The proposed framework evolves a task population to solve the original CMaOP and evolves another population to solve a helper problem derived from the original one. To assist solving the original CMaOP, a knowledge expression and transfer strategy is designed to share useful information in the helper population with the task population. Meanwhile, to balance population convergence, diversity and feasibility, an enhanced environmental selection strategy is devised by combining the ε -constrained technique, θ -dominance and subregional density evaluation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated and contrasted with six state-of-the-art algorithms on a set of benchmark CMaOPs. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of the proposed method.},

A hybrid genetic programming (HGP) algorithm is proposed to optimize the makespan of the assembly stage, which inherits the merits of genetic programming (GP) and neighbourhood search operators. In HGP, a hybrid problem-specific initialization heuristic is developed to make populations more diverse. Multiple neighbourhood search operators are employed as the leaf nodes, which are vital for the success of GP. A product shift strategy is proposed to strengthen its exploitability. In addition, a simulated annealing criterion is adopted to make the HGP explore more thoroughly. Finally, statistical and computational experiments are carried out on the benchmark instances. The results exhaustively identify the notable competitiveness of the HGP algorithm in coping with the DAPFSP-TSDST.},

To reduce the computational demands of the current HDMR metamodelling techniques, an improved high-dimensional model representation framework ( i HDMR) is presented, taking full advantage of the relationships between the first-order and second-order component functions in the Cut-HDMR theory. then, a novel metamodelling technique, termed kriging (KRG)- i HDMR, is implemented by integrating the kriging technique and the suggested surface-axes alternating sampling strategy into the i HDMR framework. The accuracy and efficiency of KRG- i HDMR are demonstrated by various numerical and engineering examples with different dimensions. Finally, an optimization problem of the multi-stage solid launch vehicle propulsion system is introduced to verify the engineering feasibility of the KRG- i HDMR metamodelling technique.},

Most studies have been concerned with single production but have neglected the widespread joint flowshop scheduling problem (JFSP). In this article, a cooperative grey wolf optimizer (CGWO) is developed to solve the JFSP. First, according to the features of the JFSP, a corresponding mathematical model is constructed, and three collaborative strategies and random generation are proposed to initialize the population. In the process of searching for prey, a discretized search for prey update mechanism is proposed, which is conducive to balancing exploration and exploitation. An energy-saving strategy is proposed to decrease energy consumption. Moreover, four local search mechanisms are developed for different optimization objectives to enhance the performance of the method in attacking the prey. The results show that the CGWO is effective in solving the JFSP.},

The main challenge is to ensure that bulk materials are available and stored according to physical and managerial constraints while minimizing storage space utilization. This article studies a new variant of the storage location assignment problem by considering contamination constraints for bulk materials. The problem is inspired by a real case study of Africa&#39;s largest fertilizer hub port. To tackle the problem, a model-driven decision support system, optimizing the storage space while satisfying vessels&#39; demands and avoiding contamination from overlapping bulk materials, is developed. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated, and an efficient rolling-horizon heuristic is investigated as a solution approach. Extensive numerical experiments are performed, and the results confirm the efficiency of this model-driven support system from both theoretical and practical points of view.},

A mathematical model and an effective multi-stage evolutionary algorithm (EMSEA) are proposed, aiming to minimize the total tardiness and total cost of production and transportation. In the EMSEA, the optimization process is divided into three stages according to the population in each generation, and four problem-based initial methods and three knowledge-based local exploitation strategies are embedded to improve its performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the EMSEA with four other algorithms and to compare the scheduling model with no splitting jobs. The results demonstrate that EMSEA is the most promising method in solving the DUPMSP/S, and the job splitting mode is effective.},

The objective of BAFSP is to minimize the total weighted makespan for agents. The BAFSP introduces various position-dependent learning effects. Furthermore, each task has an independent release date, aligned with real production scenarios. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on the transformer architecture is proposed to address the BAFSP with learning effects (BAFSP-LE). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other commonly used heuristics. To explore the feasibility of combining DRL with metaheuristics, the proposed DRL method is used as an initial solution generator.

The results indicate that cooperative disassembly can lower carbon emissions by 21.04% and increase profits by 40.04% more than sequential disassembly.

However, certain formulations of CG methods that switch between two or more CG parameters often overlook specific values that could have been integrated. Moreover, the demonstration of the sufficient descent property in these methods usually relies on a strategy that assumes the possible exclusion of certain function values. To alleviate this assumption, this article introduces a structured Liu–Storey spectral CG method. This method extends the formulation of the spectral Fletcher conjugate descent method, enabling it to maintain fast convergence and inherit a good restart property. Therefore, the method ensures that the sufficient descent property holds without additional requirements and converges globally via some standard assumptions. Additionally, the method proves useful in solving robotic and image reconstruction models. Finally, it demonstrates robustness when compared to some standard algorithms.},

SOS, utilizing minimum energy design, gradient optimization and hypersphere clustering, can adaptively explore multiple local optimal regions of the objective function simultaneously and make full use of parallel resources to obtain the global optimum efficiently. Additionally, the SOS algorithm maintains the sparsity between sample points to a certain extent, which enhances the accuracy of the surrogate model and thus improves the robustness of the optimization effect. Several numerical simulations and optimization experiments involving array decoy jamming are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy.},
