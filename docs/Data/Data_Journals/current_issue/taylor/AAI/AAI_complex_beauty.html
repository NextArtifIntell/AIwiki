  abstract     = {With the rapid development of science and technology, exploring the image logic semantics of users’ Chinese language using deep learning is crucial for understanding users’ interactions in virtual space. To address the challenges of recognizing existential sentences in Chinese language images, this research introduces a Tree-LSTM encoder, combined with an improved Transformer attention mechanism, to construct a logical semantic recognition model. The model was validated using a dataset from the Modern Dictionary database. Results showed that the proposed model achieved a recognition accuracy of 90.01%, surpassing other models by at least 2.99%. After incorporating Wikipedia data, the model’s performance in handling complex sentence structures and technical terminology was particularly outstanding. When all the extended data sources were integrated, the model’s accuracy reached 92.31%, representing a 2.3% improvement over the original dataset. This success is due to the Tree-LSTM’s ability to capture hierarchical and logical relationships within sentences. The model also effectively learns and recognizes low-frequency new words, enhancing overall performance.},

Two interdependent models are trained within a framework, allowing us to forecast interactions and identify influential features. Saliency maps were utilized to visualize the factors affecting these interactions over time. The technique helps reveal how specific viral properties shift in response to human factors.

  abstract     = {Bike-sharing systems (BSSs) have recently become important in urban transportation due to several factors, such as their cost-effectiveness and environmental considerations. The BSS provides an enormous amount of data that is recorded regarding trips. This huge volume of bike sharing data raises various challenges and opportunities. Many research studies have used bike sharing datasets to understand the geographical, social, financial, and behavioral aspects of bike user behaviors. While existing literature primarily focuses on predicting the number of rentals and returns per station, this study addresses the complementary aspect of predicting the trip duration and distance of the trip. Accurate prediction of ride duration allows a better estimate of bike availability at stations, while distance predictions assist in maintenance planning based on bike usage patterns. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, the proposed work clusters the BSS dataset into k sub-datasets based on similarity of dataset instances. Then, the predictive model is trained to predict the data of each sub-dataset separately. Thus, there will be k models for the k sub-dataset. Next, the performance of the proposed method, the average score of the k models, will be compared to the performance of a model trained on the complete dataset on predicting BSSs ride duration and distance of the trip. The rationale for splitting the dataset into k sub-datasets is to separate similar patterns in one sub-dataset. Second, the utilization of the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm on the BSSs data was proposed for the clustering purpose, as the DTW usage is very limited in the current literature of BSSs. The dataset clustering is based on the similarity of the curves representing the number of trips between each pair of bike stations throughout the day hours. Then, the DTW algorithm is used to measure the curve similarity between these bike station pairs’ curves. These two contributions of the proposed approach complement existing prediction models for rentals and returns, providing a comprehensive solution for BSS optimization. The proposed method was thoroughly evaluated on two real datasets of different sizes. For the two datasets, the obtained results show that the best improvements of the predictive model’s accuracy are 30% and 42% on average for predicting trip duration and distance of the trip, respectively.},

The prediction is challenging as EV energy consumption is highly variable and dependent on context . First, this paper proposes an integrated framework for the collection of online telematic data, processing of this data, online maintenance of statistics, and machine-learning-based prediction of travel time and energy consumption. A key feature of the proposed framework is the preprocessing of the trajectory data into triplets , a convenient data unit that captures the relevant context necessary for effective energ y prediction. The second contribution of the paper addresses the effective management of drastic change in context through robust energy prediction models. In particular, using few-shot learning techniques, we tackle the problem of the need to create different energy prediction models for different EV types, from small EVs to electric buses. Experimental results on three different data sets demonstrate how energy prediction models adapt to different EV types.},

  abstract     = {Downstream applications for point cloud registration, like LiDAR Odometry, often conduct Iterative Closest Points (ICP) in the initial frame-to-frame matching and/or subsequent map refinement. However, due to its distance-based processing nature, ICP relies on an accurate pose initialization while implicating increased computational complexity with a growing number of points. To meet specific runtime requirements, methods often apply the extensive mapping step at low frequencies, e.g. every 10 frames, which in turn leads to increased noise on the calculated trajectory. To tackle the discrepancy between runtime and accuracy, we present MagneticPillars++, an extension of our previous point cloud registration approach optimized for LiDAR Odometry, introducing novel intermediate cell correspondence filtering and accelerated match normalization. Furthermore, we propose a frame-to-keyframe matching technique replacing the simple frame-to-frame matching within a LiDAR Odometry pipeline. This can tremendously reduce noise without the need for expensive ICP corrections. We conduct extensive experiments for various tasks like point cloud registration, LiDAR Odometry, and loop closure estimation, demonstrating the versatility of our approach, where we are able to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and runtime, resulting in residual translation and rotation errors of up to 4.7 cm and 0.231 with an average runtime of.},

  abstract     = {Machine vision application in agriculture has spurred significant interest in crop-missing detection. This study targets critical challenges, such as comprehensive aerial imagery coverage, tiny seedlings easily mistaken for weeds, and the absence of adaptive learning in traditional row classification. We propose a novel methodology for missing seedling detection, which comprises three essential stages: seedling localization, row classification, and missing region prediction. We present SeedNet, a detector that leverages row direction information to enhance small seedling detection performance. By incorporating this information, SeedNet improves recall by 25.3 % and AP by 15.4 % compared to the baseline. Additionally, we introduce PeakNet, a deep learning-based classifier for row segmentation that efficiently adapts to row spacing without any prior assumptions, achieving an accuracy of 99.69 % . Finally, missing areas are predicted by analyzing the relative distances between adjacent seedlings within the same row. Under challenging outdoor conditions, this method achieves a missing detection accuracy of 98 % , meeting practical requirements for field testing. SeedNet and PeakNet demonstrate exceptional performance in real-time processing, achieving inference speeds of 105 FPS and 2295 FPS, respectively. These results indicate strong potential for practical applications in real-time agricultural systems. The proposed approach provides a high-performance, low-cost solution for crop missing detection.},

  abstract     = {The rise of social media has amplified online sharing, necessitating businesses to comprehend public sentiment. Traditional sentiment analysis struggles with sarcasm detection and class imbalance. To address this, we introduce Synthetic Ensemble Oversampling methods (SEO) that effectively leverage the strengths of various oversampling algorithms. By incorporating ensemble learning principles into oversampling techniques, our proposed methods offer distinct strategies for selecting newly generated sarcastic data. In this study, we employ five oversampling algorithms: Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN), polynom-fit-SMOTE, Proximity Weighted Synthetic Sampling (ProWSyn), and SMOTE with Instance Prioritization and Filtering (SMOTE_IPF). We work with two imbalanced sarcasm detection datasets, iSarcasmEval and SARC-reduced, collected from Twitter and Reddit. After extracting features from using Word2Vec, Global Vectors (GloVe), and FastText, we apply oversampling and ensemble techniques. Evaluated across six classifiers – Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and BERT – the results demonstrate that the SEO2 framework consistently enhances classifier performance compared to single oversampling techniques. Notably, the Cluster Uncentered method frequently provides the best improvements across datasets, achieving significant gains in both AUC and F1 scores. These findings highlight the potential of ensemble-based oversampling in addressing class imbalance for sarcasm detection.},

Contrastive learning typically employs a single contrastive relationship based on individual instances. However, depending on the task-related characteristics, such as facial skin images, this approach may be unsuitable for learning useful representations. In this work, we propose an advanced contrastive learning method to learn high-quality facial skin representations that are useful for various downstream applications related to skin disorders, such as wrinkles and pigmentation. Our method leverages metadata to establish effective multi-instance contrastive relationships specifically for facial skin images. To this end, we employ mini-batches, constructed through the integration of multiple contrastive relationships, to enable a model to learn the multifaceted features of facial skin. Using a facial skin image dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in classifying facial wrinkles and pigmentation severity compared to conventional contrastive learning. The features learned by the proposed method adapt well to other skin lesion datasets from different sources, demonstrating the transferability of the learned skin representations.

Also, the proposed synchronized parallel processing ranking based hash map framed using the merge sorting technique for categorizing the excitement scores is applied in video summarization. The framework is tested on U.S. Open and Wimbledon match videos and the results show superior results against state-of-art techniques with normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) score improved by 2%, positive matching highlight segment identification increased by 20% on YouTube Videos.},

  abstract     = {Enhancing the accuracy of industrial building energy consumption forecasts is beneficial for improving energy management and addressing the imbalance between supply and demand in building electricity use. To overcome the limitations of existing energy consumption forecasting methods, which inadequately consider the specific energy usage characteristics and user behaviors in parks and often perform poorly at predicting extreme values, this study proposes a hybrid energy consumption forecasting model combines Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Initially, SSA is used to extract the autocorrelation of the electricity consumption series and eliminate the mutual interference caused by component mixing. Then, fuzzy entropy values are utilized to differentiate the complexity of various components, reconstructing them into high-frequency and low-frequency components. These components are then predicted using a multi-factor LSTM model optimized by improved particle swarm optimization, with the results aggregated for the final forecast. The results indicate that the model’s root mean square error is only 12.116 kWh, which is lower compared to the LSTM multi-factor model, the EMD-LSTM model, and the SSA-LSTM model. The model shows a closer fit to the original series trend and more accurate predictions at extreme points, aligning more closely with actual values.},

  abstract     = {The use of regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs), which reduce hazardous air pollution and save energy, has increased with the rapid growth of industrial technology. Therefore, detecting and explaining anomalies in RTOs have become important. To accurately detect anomalies in RTOs, it is required to apply reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) models, which is currently proposed as a main AD research area. However, traditional explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) cannot explain reconstruction-based AD models to identify main facilities in RTOs. To address this problem, we developed a method to improve the accuracy of XAI in explaining reconstruction-based AD models. Specifically, we first grouped the variables based on correlation and the clustering analysis. We then calculated the impact of each group on normal/abnormal events in terms of the maximum mean discrepancy and cosine similarity. Using the most influencing variables based on our method, XAI correctly identified the main variables without considering unnecessary variables. Experimental results on a real-world RTO dataset showed that our method improve the accuracy of XAI that determine the main variables compared to the traditional XAI.},

  abstract     = {To address the problem of single-mode vulnerability to complex environments, a multimode fusion network with mutual attention is proposed. This network combines the use of laser, infrared and millimeter wave modalities to leverage the advantages of each mode in different environments, increasing the network’s resilience to interference. The study begins with the construction of pixel-level fusion networks, feature-weighted fusion networks and the multimode mutual attention fusion network. A comprehensive introduction to the multimode mutual attention fusion network is given, as well as a comparison with the other two networks. The model is then trained and evaluated using data from glide rocket and drone experiments. Finally, an analysis of the anti-outlier interference capability of the multimode fusion network with mutual attention is carried out. The test results show that the multimode mutual attention fusion network containing a feature fusion attention mechanism has the highest detection performance and anti-interference ability. Without interference, the network achieves a remarkable accuracy of 0.98 for multi-target recognition. In addition, with an accuracy of 0.96, it ensures a high level of stability in various interference environments. In addition, the introduction of multi-scale fusion has improved the rocket’s speed adaptability by about 75%.},

These reviews not only reflect customer sentiments but also crucially influence other users’ purchasing decisions due to their public accessibility. The sheer volume and complexity of product reviews make manual sorting challenging, necessitating businesses to autonomously process and discern customer sentiments. Chinese, a predominant language on e-commerce platforms, presents unique challenges in sentiment analysis due to its character-based nature. This paper introduces an innovative Dual-Channel BiLSTM-CNN (DC-BiLSTM-CNN) algorithm. Based on the language characteristics of Chinese product reviews, a sentiment analysis algorithm, dual channel BiLSTM-CNN (DC-BiLSTM-CNN), is proposed. The algorithm constructs two channels, transforming text into both character and word vectors and inputting them into Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The combination of these channels facilitates a more comprehensive feature extraction from reviews. Comparative analysis revealed that DC-BiLSTM-CNN significantly outperforms baseline models, substantially enhancing the classification of product reviews. We conclude that the proposed DC-BiLSTM-CNN algorithm offers an effective solution for handling Chinese product reviews, carrying positive implications for businesses seeking to enhance product and service quality, ultimately resulting in heightened user satisfaction.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges when drilling small and deep holes is the difficulty of chip evacuation. As the hole depth increases, chips tend to become tightly compressed, causing chip jamming. It leads to a rapid increase in cutting forces and strong random fluctuations. The discontinuous chip evacuation process makes the cutting force signal strongly nonlinear and random, making it difficult to predict accurately. In this paper, we have developed a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) model for training using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to predict torque during deep drilling. Unlike many previous studies, this model uses hole depth as an input vector element instead of hole diameter. The model has been validated through experiments drilling AISI-304 stainless steel with hole depth-to-diameter ratios of 8 under continuous drilling conditions with ultrasonic-assisted vibration. The performance of the ANN model was compared with the exponential model and evaluated by the MAPE index. Results show that the ANN model has better predictive capability, the average MAPE value approximately four times smaller and higher reliability with a standard deviation approximately 3.5 times smaller than the exponential function model. This model can be further refined to predict torque for drilling deep holes for future studies.},

This study investigates ASI based on features derived from spectrogram images through a convolution neural network (CNN) with rectangular-shaped kernels. Traditionally, CNN employs square-shaped kernel and max-pooling operations at different layers, a design optimized to handle 2D data. Nevertheless, encoding of information differs slightly to deal with spectrograms. The frequency is displayed along the y-axis, and the x-axis presents the time of the audio. Amplitude is denoted by intensity within the spectrogram image at certain point. The main contributions of this study are 1: To analyze audio signals effectively using spectrograms, this study proposed the utilization of spectrogram features with different sizes and shapes of rectangular kernels to derive distinctive features by improving the recognition accuracy of the speaker identification system. 2. The extracted spectrogram-based features and models are evaluated on the ELSDSR, TSP, and LibriSpeech datasets and achieved the weighted accuracy of 96.0%, 99.2%, and 97.6%, respectively. 3.

The q -ROF-CRITIC assigns the priority weights of the attributes (i.e. comprehension and ergonomic principles), whereas the q -ROF-TOPSIS-Sort evaluates and classifies the compliance levels of road signs in view of a set of pre-defined categories, consequently bridging the limitations of the TOPSIS-Sort in handling imprecise evaluations. Demonstrated in an actual case study of evaluating 83 road signs in the Philippines, results show that prohibitive signs have the highest comprehension levels, while parking and stop signs, together with road obstacle signs, belong to the medium compliance level. Low-level compliance is observed for supplementary and intersection road signs due to unfamiliarity, while horizontal signs are ergonomically low on spatial and physical attributes. The proposed approach is supported by sensitivity analysis of q values and comparative assessments with other methods. The findings encourage further investigation into comprehensibility evaluations and open avenues for exploring the factors that influence road sign comprehension.},

This type of monitoring often relies on the use of navigation systems such as the Automatic Identification System (AIS). AIS data has been used to support the defense teams when identifying equipment defects, locating suspicious activity, ensuring ship collision avoidance, and detecting hazardous events. In this context, Ship Trajectory Prediction (STP) has been conducted using AIS data to support the estimation of vessel routes and locations, contributing to maritime safety and situational awareness. Currently, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model is considered the state-of-the-art for STP. However, this model can be time-consuming and can only represent a single vessel track. To solve these challenges, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models have been applied to STP to allow scalability for large data sets and to capture larger regions or anomalous vessels behavior. This research proposes a new RNN architecture that decreases the prediction error up to 50% for cargo vessels when compared to the OU model. Results also confirm that the proposed Decimal Preservation layer can benefit other RNN architectures developed in the literature by reducing their prediction errors for complex data sets.},

Fourth predictive systems are employed to investigate the intricate problem of predicting the severity of injuries sustained in traffic crashes using different regression algorithms, such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks. Compared to comparable systems without feature selection, feature resampling, and optimization methods, the results demonstrate that employing optimized XGBoost along with grid search in conjunction with SelectKBest and SMOTE strategy has resulted in greater performance, with an 89% R2 score. Our findings provide insight into the requirement for accurate forecasting models in optimization and balanced approaches to enhancing traffic safety. These findings offer a viable way to improve traffic safety tactics. As far as we know and as of right now, there hasn’t been much interest in supporting a fusion-based system that critically reviews machine learning techniques using grid search optimization, feature selection, and smote technique and examines how injury severity prediction is affected by road crashes.},

  abstract     = {This paper designs the MKSE and SEMSS methods. Among them, MKSE uses an improved TF-IDF weight calculation method to extract keywords and applies virtual keywords to construct inverted indexes, making it difficult for malicious attackers to infer the index content easily. SEMSS uses the Apriori algorithm to mine the co-occurrence relationship between words and find the keyword set that meets the minimum support threshold to improve the recall rate of search results. Finally, the security of the scheme is verified from the aspects of semantic security, effici this paper designsency, data integrity, etc. The results showed that the data encryption time of MKSE and TRSE methods increased gradually with the increase in document collection storage. The index build time was increased as the document set grew. The accuracy of the improved TF-IDF method was 63.8%. The running time of Apriori decreased with the increase of minimum support. When the minimum support was 12.0%, the Apriori algorithm ran for 211 seconds. The MKSE method was more efficient than the TRSE method in searching documents by query keywords. When the document set size was 3000, the SEMSS method had a full search rate of 81.09%. This research realizes the semantic security of outsourced data, which can efficiently and comprehensively carry out cryptographic retrieval based on keyword sorting.},

However, acquiring clear images of distant targets presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a supervised learning approach for image super-resolution. Our network architecture builds upon the U-Net framework, incorporating enhancements to the encoder and decoder through techniques such as Discrete Wavelet Transform, Channel Attention Residual Modules, Selective Kernel Feature Fusion, Weight Normalization, and Dropout. We evaluate our model on a super-resolution dataset and compare its performance against other networks, highlighting the importance of minimizing trainable parameters for real-time deployment on resource-constrained drone platforms. The effWicacy of our proposed network is further validated through image recognition tasks and real-world scenario testing. By enhancing image clarity at extended ranges, our approach enables drones to detect adversaries earlier, facilitating proactive countermeasures and improving mission success rates},

This approach aims to handle the distributed trust issues of federated learning users and update data states rapidly. By modeling multi-source devices through federated learning, the model parameters and reputation values of participating devices are stored on the blockchain. This method incorporates factors such as experience, familiarity, and timeliness to more quickly gather reliable information about nodes to assess their behavior. Simulation results on the MNIST dataset show that when the proportion of selfish nodes is below 50%, the convergence time increases with the proportion of selfish nodes. Compared to advanced algorithms, the proposed model saves approximately 6% of interaction time. As the number of transactions significantly increases, the system’s TPS (Transactions Per Second) decreases, with an average TPS of only 3079.35 when the maximum number of transactions is 4000. The proposed scheme can filter out high-quality data sources during real-time dynamic data exchange, enhancing the accuracy of federated learning training and ensuring privacy security.},

The recent advances and successes of deep learning in detecting plant diseases have inspired this study. This study assessed a U-Net semantic segmentation deep learning model for the early detection and segmentation of Fusarium Wilt and Black Sigatoka banana diseases. This model was trained using 18,240 banana leaf and stalk images affected by these two banana diseases. The dataset was collected from the farms using mobile phone cameras with the guidance of agricultural experts and was annotated to label the images. The results showed that the U-Net model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 96.45% and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 93.23%.

Large-scale industrial systems generate an immense volume of logs, which are difficult to handle with human capabilities. Therefore, an automated method is essential for filtering vast amounts of data. System log anomaly detection is crucial in the security field for identifying system failures, sophisticated internal attacks, and other deviations from the norm. This research area requires further development, as most Deep Learning solutions in the literature are semi-supervised. This poses a significant limitation since these solutions are impractical for large-scale ecosystems due to the high cost of labeling data. This paper introduces a method that replaces the supervised phase of semi-supervised methods with fully unsupervised heuristics, utilizing the elbow method, interquartile range, and Simulated Annealing. The unsupervised results are comparable to the semi-supervised State of the Art while demonstrating greater applicability in real-world applications. This work proposes a more suitable benchmark for the log anomaly outlier detection problem, where the training data include both normal and abnormal sequences and precede the test sessions in time. Additionally, it presents metrics on distinct log sequences to mitigate the impact of unbalanced anomaly types.},

Predicting potential friendships accurately from abundant information has become a pivotal research area. While graph neural network (GNN) have shown significant promise in prediction, existing approaches often fail to fully exploit the heterogeneous data characteristics in LBSN. Key challenges include inadequate modeling of the intricate relationships between users and points of interest (POI), overlooking the significance of spatial-temporal information in user trajectories, and underutilizing rich edge features. To address these challenges, we design a novel GRU-enhanced Heterogeneous Multigraph Attention Network (GEHMAN), which is a GNN model enhanced by GRU. We construct a heterogeneous multigraph to comprehensively capture user-POI relationships. We then employ a skip-gram model to embed POI nodes from user sub-trajectories and use RNN with GRU units to embed user nodes. GEHMAN utilize hierarchical attention mechanism to consolidate node information by aggregating diverse types of neighboring nodes and connecting edges. Experiments on six real city datasets show that compared with the best performance of six benchmark methods including LBSN2vec++, Metapath2vec and HAN, the average improvement percentages of GEHMAN in AUC, AP, and Top@K are 2.225%, 1.948%, and 6.353%, respectively.},
