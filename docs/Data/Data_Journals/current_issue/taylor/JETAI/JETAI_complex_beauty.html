  abstract     = {Computer-aided diagnosis process in the field of health, especially cancer diagnosis, is of vital importance. Computer-aided diagnosis helps specialist physicians to make the most accurate diagnosis. According to research studies, it has been stated that the number of wrong or late diagnosis increases with each passing year and ultimately causes the death of people living in many parts of the world. For this reason, some calculations must be made to determine the most accurate one in the algorithm to be used to make the correct diagnosis. In this study, three different database Monk’ problems were used to determine the most accurate algorithm for medical diagnosis. Monk’ problems are used as one of the several classification problems used to create an important comparative study. Train and test operations were performed using five different Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) (k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Decision Tree Algorithm (DT), Random Forest Algorithm (RF), Naive Bayes algorithm (NB), Support Vector Cases (SVM)). These machine learning algorithms are compared statistically in terms of performance. Two different databases in the medical field were used to test the results (Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set, Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set). In the test processes in the experimental studies, the highest accuracy rate was obtained from the k-NN, DT, RF, NB, SVM algorithms, respectively; 0.9758, 1, 1, 0.9180, 0.9344. The best performance was obtained from RF MLA for 1. dataset, DT MLA for 2. dataset, highest accuracy rates from k-NN and RF MLAs in 3. dataset.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, high energy amount is being wasted by computing servers and personal electronic devices, which produce a high amount of carbon dioxide. Thus, it is required to decrease energy usage and pollution. Many applications are utilised by green computing to save energy. Scheduling of tasks acts as an important process to reach the mentioned goals. It is worth stating that the vital characteristic of task scheduling in green clouds is the load balancing of tasks on virtual machines. Efficient load balancing moves tasks from overloaded to underloaded virtual machines to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS). This issue is an NP-complete problem, so this research suggests a new technique based on the behavioural structure of artificial bee behaviour. This method aims to improve QoS while lowering energy usage in green computing. In addition, the honey bees are considered the removed tasks from overloaded virtual machines and a candidate for migrating selected tasks with the lowest priority. The CloudSim testing findings demonstrate that the technique is successful in QoS, makespan, and energy usage compared to other ways.},

  abstract     = {The major aim of education organisation is to ensure better education to students and reducing the failure percentage of poor students. Early prediction of student’s performance is a complex process to enhance the academic performance. However, it is complex to analyse huge data manually. Therefore, an automated model is essential for mining the educational performance of the students. Educational data mining (EDM) is more efficient when compared with statistical approaches utilised for exploring data for predicting the performance of students. This work has four major processes: (i) pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) classification and (iv) evaluating performance. Initially, the data are pre-processed and the necessary features are extracted using Word2Vec and Term Frequency &amp; Inverse Gravity Moment. The major novelty of this work is to utilise deep learning model attention based on bi-directional long short-term memory convolutional neural network with gate mechanism and to find the students’ academic performance. The performance of the proposed model is compared over the metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, precision and F -measure, respectively. Results prove that the proposed model highly influences the performance of students. The analysis showed that the students who utilise social networks for the whole week showed less performance when compared to students who utilise social networks only during weekends.},

  abstract     = {One of the main areas of research in Social Network Analysis (SNA) is Link Prediction (LP). The LP problem is useful in understanding the evolution mechanism of social networks, as well as in different applications such as recommendation systems, bioinformatics and marketing. In LP algorithms, prior network information is used to predict future connections in social networks. In this paper, we introduce a multi-wave cellular learning automaton (MWCLA) and use it to solve the LP problem in social networks. This model is a new CLA with a connected structure and a module of LAs in each cell where the neighbours of the cell module are its successors. The MWCLA method uses multiple waves at the same time in the network in order to improve convergence speed as well as accuracy. For predicting links in the social network, multiple waves can be used to consider different aspects of the network. Here we show that the model converges upon a stable and compatible configuration. Compared to some state-of-the-art approaches, MWCLA produces significantly better results when applied to the LP problem.},

  abstract     = {In unconstrained environments, it encounters a number of challenges when considering handcrafted features for face recognition, including changes in pose, illumination and facial expression and plastic surgery variations, look-alike faces and selfie images. As majority of the published works on local descriptors are based on the relationship between the centre pixel and neighbourhood pixels at different radial widths, by including the relationship between different neighbourhood pixels of a target pixel with it can facilitate the decoupling of the discriminatory features further. To exploit such relationships and to mitigate the challenges, the proposed study reports a novel local descriptor called Local Directional Octa Pattern (LDOP) that makes use of derivative operation and three well-known metrics, namely, histogram intersection, K-nearest neighbour and Euclidean distance for face identification. Rigorous experiments have been conducted on six benchmark face databases, namely, Extended Yale Face B, Labeled Faces in the Wild, Plastic Surgery, Look-alike, UMDAA-02-FD and ORL, confirming the superiority of the proposed local descriptor over state-of-the-art descriptors with accuracies of 97.37%, 49.09%, 75.47%, 31.2% and 93.31% at Rank–10 and 100% at Rank-5 determined on the databases, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates ensemble feature selection using the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process. A novel algorithm is proposed for the study of ensemble feature selection and it is called as q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy MCDM extended to the Visekriterijumska optimizacija Ikompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) (q-ROHFS VIKOR). This is the first time in the literature an ensemble feature selection problem is modelled as a q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy MCDM extended to VIKOR technique. In the proposed method, every feature is ranked based on different available rankers and a preference matrix is obtained. In the sigmoidal transformation, the tuning parameter a plays a vital role in the fuzzification process. This tuning parameter reduces the computation run-time in the fuzzification process for different high-dimensional datasets that are considered in this paper. By using q-ROHFS VIKOR method, a score is assigned to each feature based on the values of the preference matrix. At last, an output rank vector is produced for all features from which the user can select the desired number of features. To prove the efficiency and optimality of the proposed method, the comparison with basic filter-based feature selections and ensemble feature selection using feature ranking strategy is obtained. The proposed method in this paper is superior and efficient than the ensemble methods based on the accuracy and F-score levels upto 0.96.},
