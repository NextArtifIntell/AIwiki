  abstract     = {With IoT development, safety attacks are growing gradually as well. Numerous centralized attack-detecting schemes were developed for detecting IoT attacks namely, ML and DL schemes, which classify it as normal or attack. However, because to the various requirements of IoT devices, the most of the plans fall short of achieving noticeable results. In this study, a blockchain method is used to construct a novel attack-detecting scheme for IOT. Here, a system using blockchain is employed to process information in a logical sequence. At first, enhanced data normalization is deployed. Then, the features like “Exponential Moving Average, improved Holoentropy, higher-order statistical features, and mutual information” are extracted. Then feature selection is done via Improved Principal Component Analysis. The selected traits are evaluated “hybrid classification that includes Gated Recurrent Unit and Deep Belief Network” to discover the attacks in IoT. Finally, the advancements of this work are established over others. The proposed HC(GRU + DBN) scheme has attained higher accuracy of 97.2% for the best case of 92%,91%,94%,84%, and 92% to current schemes like SVM, RF, RNN, LSTM, and NB.},

  abstract     = {Classical cryptography is the process of hiding information and it manages the secret knowledge by encrypting the plain text message through the translation of it to an unintelligible message. Quantum cryptography is also hiding the plain text through encryption and it works based on the law of quantum physics for providing absolute security of data communication. It uses the idea of quantum mechanics to gadget a cryptographic system and the key problems are solved by intrusion detection including the Eavesdropping detection using quantum expertise. On the contrary, principles of secured communication protocol systems are demonstrated with classical quantum cryptography where the keys are distributed securely and are applied in quantum key distribution as well. In this paper, we provide a survey of works on classical cryptography and quantum cryptography and compare them with respect to time, security level and the classification of the data. Moreover, we perform a concise analysis of perspective classical cryptography and the conception of Quantum cryptography with various protocols and highlight the benefits of classical cryptography and Quantum cryptography in different applications. Finally, we provide a set of recommendations for selecting the suitable encryption model for securing the communication.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing environment offers huge computation power and enormous storage capacity. The cloud framework enables users to organize the data-intensive applications without the investment of substructure and it acts as a key role in the digital era, as it simultaneously handles the data from the number of users. Besides the useful characteristic features, providing security to data that is stored in cloud platform offers a great challenge in cloud storage. Using the proposed F-ALO technique, a privacy protection model is developed to encrypt the data before sharing it in the cloud. To achieve effective data protection, the proposed F-ALO algorithm was developed by combining the Fractional Calculus (FC) and Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) algorithms. By incorporating the privacy protection and data sharing phases, employing the MapReduce framework’s mappers and reducers, the shared data is safeguarded. Using the proposed algorithm based on the factors, such as markedness and sensitivity index, the optimal coefficient is calculated. The proposed F-ALO algorithm achieved higher performance with measures, like sensitivity index, markedness, accuracy, Database Difference Ratio (DBDR), computational overhead, time complexity and space complexity with the values of 0.8422, 0.9366, 0.9339, 0.8192, 0.7357, 0.4678, and 0.3679 using the Hungarian database.},

  abstract     = {Symptoms and types of breast cancer, like most other diseases, vary from person to person. This is while some infected people may not have any symptoms. Breast cancer is one of the common cancers among women, of course, some types of it also affect men. Basically, timely and early diagnosis before the progress of the disease can significantly provide treatment grounds. There are many approaches to breast cancer diagnosis. Classification of patients in terms of benign or malignant cancer using data mining techniques has attracted the attention of many researchers. Data mining can provide a medical assistant system with very low cost and high accuracy for early detection of breast cancer. In this regard, this study proposes a data mining-based method by a combining Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and an evolutionary approach for breast cancer diagnosis. We aim to tune MLP parameters using an evolutionary approach. Here, Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) is used as a new evolutionary approach. However, the capabilities of approaches such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Open-Source Development Model Algorithm (ODMA) are analyzed compared to TLBO. The proposed method named MLP-TLBO can simultaneously adjust all MLP parameters (i.e., effective features and their number, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each hidden layer, and weights of links). To improve the classification process, MLP-TLBO develops an ensemble classification mechanism in which multiple MLPs simultaneously model the training data. The evaluation of the proposed method is done on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database. We use three common datasets from Wisconsin including WBCD, WDBC and WPBC for simulations. Based on the results, the proposed method has promising results and averages between 7% and 26% better performance compared to similar methods.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble clustering emerged as an important extension of classical clustering problems and is one of the most recent advances in unsupervised learning. Its purpose is to combine the results obtained using different algorithms by a consensus function so that the final solution is more favorable than the individual clustering algorithms. In this study, we propose a semi-supervised clustering ensemble framework using cluster consensus selection, which tries to improve the accuracy of clustering results. In general, there are two types of semi-supervised clustering algorithms, including constraint-based and metric-based. Here, the proposed ensemble clustering algorithm is equipped with a semi-supervised clustering mechanism based on pairwise constraints. Since the complexity of consensus functions scales with the number of clustering methods, processing big data for ensemble clustering is sometimes slow or impossible. Usually, all primary clusters from all clustering methods are used in the consensus function. However, the merit of clusters from different methods can be considered to improve the consensus quality. Accordingly, we propose a cluster consensus selection approach that selects a subset of meriting primary clusters to participate in the final consensus. Here, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is developed to measure the merit of clusters. Meanwhile, reducing the number of primary clusters in the consensus function can enable big data clustering. The proposed algorithm is very computationally efficient and provides linear complexity in clustering. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of different performance metrics such as NMI, ARI and CPCC.},
