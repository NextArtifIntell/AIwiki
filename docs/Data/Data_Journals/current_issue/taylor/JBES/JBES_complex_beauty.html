In contrast to the principal component analysis based approach, Q-MLE considers the heteroscedasticity of the idiosyncratic error term, the heteroscedasticity of which is simultaneously estimated with other parameters. Interestingly, under the homoscedasticity assumption of the idiosyncratic error, the Q-MLE estimator encompassed the projected estimator (PE) as a special case. We provide the convergence rates and asymptotic distributions of the Q-MLE estimators under mild conditions. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the Q-MLE method performs better, especially when heteroscedasticity exists. Furthermore, two real examples in finance and macroeconomics reveal factor patterns across rows and columns, which coincide with financial, economic, or geographical interpretations.},

The novelty of the proposed test is that it allows the number of covariates and instruments to be larger than the sample size. The test is scale-invariant and robust to heteroscedastic errors. To construct the final test statistic, we first introduce a test based on the maximum norm of multiple parameters that could be high-dimensional. The theoretical power based on the maximum norm is higher than that in the modified Cragg-Donald test, the only existing test allowing for large-dimensional covariates. Second, following the principle of power enhancement, we introduce the power-enhanced test, with an asymptotically zero component used to enhance the power to detect some extreme alternatives with many locally invalid instruments. Finally, an empirical example of the trade and economic growth nexus demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed test.},

This condition holds if and only if the net change in the untreated outcome densities is common across treated and control groups. Unlike the Changes-in-Changes model our model is compatible with the usual DID assumption for means, and it provides a computationally simple and straightforward way to control for covariates. We establish uniform consistency and weak convergence of the proposed estimator of QTT and the related functions. The estimators and the simultaneous confidence bands remain valid even for discrete outcome variables.

To tighten these bounds, the second set also imposes the monotone treatment response assumption, while the third set additionally imposes a stochastic dominance assumption. Finally, we use experimental data from the Colombian job training program Jóvenes en Acción to empirically illustrate our approach’s usefulness.

  abstract     = {Multiperiod portfolio choice is the central problem in active asset management. Multiperiod dynamic portfolios are notoriously difficult to solve, especially when there are hundreds of tradable assets as well as a large number of state variables. In this article, we develop a novel two-step methodology to solve the multiperiod dynamic portfolio choice problem with high dimensional assets in the presence of return predictability conditional on a large number of state predictors. Specifically, in the first step, we propose the new Risk-Premium Projected-PCA (RP-PPCA) method to reduce the dimension of tradable assets. This method achieves Dimension Reduction (DR) by estimating latent factors with explanatory power in both time series variation and expected return in high-dimension-low-sample-size data. In the second step, we use dynamic programming to solve the multiperiod portfolio choice problem, and in each recursive step, we adopt an Adjusted semiparametric Model Averaging (AMA) method to avoid the curse of dimensionality associated with a large set of state variables while remaining computationally efficient. Thus, we name this two-step approach DRAMA, which stands for a combination of a new dimension reduction method and an adjusted semiparametric model averaging method. Analytically, we show that the portfolios constructed by the DRAMA are approximately optimal under mild assumptions. Moreover, our numerical results based on empirical data from US stock markets show that the proposed portfolios have excellent out-of-sample performances.},

The new methods combine the parameter expansion (PX) ideas of Liu, Rubin, and Wu with the stochastic expectation-maximization (SEM) algorithm in likelihood and moment-based contexts. The goal is to facilitate convergence in models with a large space of latent variables by improving algorithmic efficiency. This is achieved by specifying expanded models within the M step. Effectively, we are proposing new estimators for the pseudo-data within iterations that take into account the fact that the model of interest is misspecified for draws based on parameter values far from the truth. We establish the asymptotic equivalence of the likelihood-based PX-SEM to an alternative SEM algorithm with a smaller expected fraction of missing information compared to the standard SEM based on the original model, implying a faster global convergence rate. Finally, in simulations we show that the new algorithms significantly improve the convergence speed relative to standard SEM algorithms, sometimes dramatically so, by reducing the total computing time from hours to a few minutes.},

  abstract     = {We propose a smooth shadow-rate version of the dynamic Nelson-Siegel (DNS) model to analyze the term structure of interest rates during a zero lower bound (ZLB) period. By relaxing the no-arbitrage restriction, our shadow-rate model becomes highly tractable with a closed-form yield curve expression. This permits the implementation of readily available DNS extensions such as allowing for time-varying parameters and the integration of macroeconomic variables. Using U.S. Treasury data, we provide clear evidence of a smooth transition of the yields entering and leaving the ZLB state. Moreover, we show that the smooth shadow-rate DNS model dominates the baseline DNS model and (shadow-rate) affine term structure models in terms of fitting and forecasting the yield curve, while it also produces plausible policy insights at the ZLB.},

  abstract     = {We adaptively estimate both changepoints and local outlier processes in a Bayesian dynamic linear model with global-local shrinkage priors in a novel model we call Adaptive Bayesian Changepoints with Outliers (ABCO). We use a state-space approach to identify a dynamic signal in the presence of outliers and measurement error with stochastic volatility. We find that global state equation parameters are inadequate for most real applications and we include local parameters to track noise at each time-step. This setup provides a flexible framework to detect unspecified changepoints in complex series, such as those with large interruptions in local trends, with robustness to outliers and heteroscedastic noise. Finally, we compare our algorithm against several alternatives to demonstrate its efficacy in diverse simulation scenarios and two empirical examples on the U.S. economy.},

  abstract     = {Skew-t copula models are attractive for the modeling of financial data because they allow for asymmetric and extreme tail dependence. We show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and Capitanio allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence than two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high dimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian variational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an augmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A stochastic gradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The methodology is used to estimate skew-t factor copula models with up to 15 factors for intraday returns from 2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity in asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in pairwise correlations. In a moving window study we show that the asymmetric dependencies also vary over time, and that intraday predictive densities from the skew-t copula are more accurate than those from benchmark copula models. Portfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise asymmetric dependencies improve performance relative to the index.},
