Spin-1/2 noble gases have intrinsic coherence times in the order of hours to days, which allows for incredibly low frequency error of free-precession measurements. However, relaxation in miniature cells is dominated by interactions with the cell wall, which limits the performance of a chip-scale sensor that uses noble gases. While 129 Xe wall relaxation times have previously been limited to 10s of seconds in mm-sized cells, we demonstrate the first anodically bonded batch-fabricated cells with dual 3 He- 129 Xe isotopes and 87 Rb in a 6 mm 3 volume with 3 He and 129 Xe T 2 coherence times of, respectively, 4 h and 300 s.

The resonator operates in the cross-sectional Lamé (X-Lamé) mode at 64.7 MHz, exhibiting an ultra-high quality factor ( Q ) of 110 000 and a first-order temperature coefficient of frequency ( T C F 1 ) compensation. Additionally, the resonator provides amplitude-dependent frequency tunability through elastic Duffing. A secondary cross-sectional square-extensional (X-SE) mode at 92 MHz, with high linear temperature sensitivity, enables in situ temperature sensing. An oscillator is constructed with autonomous loop-gain control, leveraging the X-SE mode to compensate for the second-order TCF ( T C F 2 ) of the X-Lamé mode through nonlinear Duffing. This results in a frequency reference with a third-order temperature characteristic, featuring an insensitive region around the inflection points, with a T C F 3 of 7 ppb/ ° C 3 . An overall frequency drift of ± 1.88 ppb is measured for this weakly nonlinear oscillator over 1.47 °C temperature range near the 56 °C inflection point, showing an order of magnitude reduction in instability compared to the linear operation mode.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite materials have been extensively studied in the field of solar cells, and inorganic perovskites, with their good environmental and radiation stability, high defect tolerance, and high carrier mobility, also have great potential for betavoltaic batteries. In this study, we analyze the potential of all-inorganic perovskite betavoltaic batteries. The metal electrode commonly used in perovskite cell devices, such as Au, has a large effect on β particle incidence. MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) have excellent electrical conductivity, while their loose and porous structure reduces the effect on β particle incidence, which is an ideal electrode for betavoltaic nuclear batteries. Therefore, we propose the FTO/TiO 2 /CsPbBr 3 /NiO x /MWCNT structure and explore the prospects of CsPbBr 3 in betavoltaic batteries through simulations and experiments. The simulation results in an open-circuit voltage (V o c ) of 0.53 V, a short-circuit current (J s c ) of 21.53 nA cm −2 , a maximum output power (P m ) of 9.05 nW cm −2 , and a conversion efficiency ( ⁠ η ⁠ ) of 2.9%. The experimentally obtained V o c is 0.42 V, J s c is 12.22 nA cm −2 , P m is 2.55 nW cm −2 , and η is 0.8%.

Here, inspired by avian eyes, we propose a tetrachromatic-bidirectional synaptic transistor based on WOx/WSe 2 heterojunctions with a ultraviolet (UV)-photoactive floating gate of CdS and realize the bio-avian vision with enhanced image and improved recognition under a multi-spectral background. The positive-synaptic responses are exhibited within the visible wavelength band while the negative response is for the UV wavelength band. Moreover, the bionic-kestrel vision behaviors are exhibited, such as the in-site enhanced color object images and the improved recognition accuracy from 58% to 93.1% due to the contribution of UV negative response. This work provides an effective neuromorphic vision to recognize the feature signatures from the multi-spectral contexts.},

We uncover the existence of the hidden symmetry and unearth the topology for the origin of chiral edge state pairs using winding number of a subspace Hamiltonian. The measured dispersion and localization of sound on the edges verify the observations in theory and simulations.

Spin–orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interaction induce valley-layer locking when the bilayer is ferromagnetic, however, spin-layer locking appears for the case of antiferromagnetic states. The inequivalent interlayer antiferroelectric couplings correspond to different magnetic ground states, and the antiferroelectric states can be switched through the breathing process, so the ferroelectric, magnetic, and valley properties can be simultaneously modulated. Through first-principles calculations, we also predict a favorable breathing Kagome bilayer W 3 Br 8 , where the above coupling mechanism and tunable layer-locked valley Hall effects can be achieved.

The temperature dependence of α E exhibits a peak at the magnetic transition temperature T C in zero magnetic field, evidencing an enhanced magnetoelectric effect near the phase boundary. When a DC magnetic field is applied along either a - or b -axis, the peak position of α E shifts continuously to a higher temperature while the peak amplitude reaches the maximum at a critical field and decays for higher magnetic fields. The obtained magnetoelectric phase diagram suggests that the maximum dynamic magnetoelectric effect occurs in a region above T C where short-range magnetic correlations play a crucial role and the peak is due to a metamagnetic transition. The measurements of the magnetostrictive coefficient dλ/d H reveal that the magnetoelectric effect is closely related to the magnetoelastic coupling. Our study provides insights toward achieving significant dynamic magnetoelectric effect at high temperatures in polar magnets.},

Interestingly, we observed that in MnGe thin films, both π- and π/2-periodicities coexist. The emergence of π/2 periodicity is closely linked to specific features observed in the M–H curves. Magnetic force microscopy data reveal that the two periodic PHE signals correspond to distinct, spatially separated magnetic domains.

In this study, we theoretically investigated the motion of DWSKs driven by spin-polarized currents in ferromagnetic strips. Our findings reveal that the motion of DWSKs is contingent upon the direction of the current. When the current is applied parallel to the domain wall, both spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin–orbit torque (SOT) can drive the DWSK along the domain wall. Conversely, for currents applied perpendicular to the domain wall, STT can induce DWSK motion by leveraging the skyrmion Hall effect as a driving force, whereas SOT-driven DWSKs halt their motion after sliding along the domain wall. Furthermore, we demonstrated the current-driven motion of DWSKs along curved domain walls and proposed a racetrack memory architecture utilizing DWSKs. These findings advance the understanding of DWSK dynamics and provide insights for the design of spintronic devices based on DWSKs.},

In this study, we report the generation of a large charge-to-spin conversion and bidirectional OOP-SOT by engineering a vertical magnetization gradient within a Co/Ho multilayer system. Exploiting the antiferromagnetic coupling between Co and Ho, the magnetization gradient up to 16.8 (emu/cm −3 )/nm was achieved by gradually varying the Ho layer thickness from 0.4 to 0.9 nm. The presence of the OOP-SOT was confirmed through Hall resistance-field loop shift measurements, which has been attributed to the broken symmetry in spin current reflection and transmission in the Co/Ho multilayer with vertical magnetic property gradients. Additionally, the effective field of the OOP-SOT is strongly correlated with the direction of the magnetization gradient, measured to be around +0.7 and –2.5 Oe/mA for the positive and negative magnetization gradients, respectively. Furthermore, the largest SOT in the Co/Ho multilayer with a negative gradient was observed compared to the positive gradient and uniform Co/Ho multilayer structures. The enhanced SOT is attributed to the bulk Rashba field generated by the gradient structure, along with increased spin polarization. The results demonstrated here provide a promising approach for utilizing magnetization gradients for the development of efficient, current-driven spin-based storage and logic devices.},

Multiple mechanisms related to efficiency loss are independently examined, including injection efficiency, carrier density vs current density relationship, phase space filling, quantum-confined Stark effect, and Coulomb enhancement. An optimal QW thickness of around 2.7 nm in these InGaN/GaN LEDs was determined for QWs having constant In composition. Despite improved control of deep-level defects and lower carrier density at a given current density, LEDs with thin QWs still suffer from an imbalance in enhancement effects on the radiative and intrinsic Auger–Meitner recombination coefficients. The imbalance in enhancement effects results in a decline in internal quantum efficiency and radiative efficiency with decreasing QW thickness at low current density in LEDs with QW thicknesses below 2.7 nm. We also investigate how LED modulation bandwidth varies with QW thickness, identifying the key trends and their implications for device performance.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic materials featuring topology and flatband in their electronic structure bridge the topological quantum physics and strongly correlated many-body physics, but materials that manifest this feature are rare. Here, we predict a class of ideal intrinsic magnetic topological insulators naturally featuring a nontrivial flatband in the two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb-kagome lattices X 2 Rb 3 ( X =Cr, Mo, W). In the absence of spin–orbit coupling (SOC), these monolayers are spin-polarized half-semimetals with a twofold degenerate nodal point and a flatband appearing at the Fermi level simultaneously. With SOC included, a significant bandgap (168 meV for W 2 Rb 3 ) opens up at the band touching point, and the flatband that spans the whole Brillouin zone becomes nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number ( C = 1). The topological property calculations verify that X 2 Rb 3 monolayers are intrinsic quantum anomalous Hall effect materials. Due to the similarity to 2D continuum Landau levels, the striking nontrivial flatband in X 2 Rb 3 makes it an ideal platform to investigate the flatband physics, such as the realization of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in real materials.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate the unidirectional propagation of structure-induced edge waves in a thin plate. These waves, termed designer flexural edge waves (DFEWs), are observed along the free edge of a thin plate featuring periodically corrugated rectangular grooves. These DFEWs can be activated unidirectionally using either a pair of point sources exhibiting phase differences or a “chiral” source characterized by a clockwise phase distribution, as evidenced in the experimental results. The observed asymmetric behavior in the former scenario is attributed to the destructive interference among the edge waves. In the latter scenario, we elucidate this phenomenon by analyzing the spatial Fourier spectrum. The chiral source induces a spatial asymmetry, while the periodic edge structure selects the specific evanescent components of the asymmetric Fourier spectrum.},

  abstract     = {The metal–semiconductor contact resistivity has become a severe challenge for three-dimensional (3D) integration. In this work, starting from the physical origin, we propose that the charge redistribution is an effective strategy for decreasing Schottky barrier height (SBH), subsequently leading to a reduction in contact resistivity. Guided by this perspective, first-principles calculations are utilized to investigate the effect of a series of metal dopants on the SBH in the NiSi/Si system. The Φ B e values of NiSi/Si can be reduced to 0.27, 0.28, and 0.22 eV in Sc, Ti, and Zr doped systems, respectively. Especially for the Zr dopant, it can achieve ultra-low contact resistivity of 2.30 × 10 −9 Ω cm 2 , which can be ascribed to the dominant charge redistribution effect. In contrast, high electronegativity dopants like Au and Ir increase Φ B e ⁠ . Dopant diffusion and concentration effects are also examined, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. This work provides a useful theoretical guidance in reducing contact resistivity for 3D integration.},

  abstract     = {Interband cascade lasers (ICLs) are semiconductor lasers emitting in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR 3–6 μ m) and can operate as frequency combs (FCs). These demonstrations are based on double section cavities that can reduce dispersion and/or are adapted for radio frequency operation. Here, we show that ICL FCs at long wavelengths, where the refractive index dispersion reduces, can be realized in a single long section cavity. We show FC generation for ICLs operating at λ ∼ 4.2 μ m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified shifted wave interference Fourier transform spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free running operation. Further, we show that, through active mode-locking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell–Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (∼100 ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.},
