  abstract     = {Further unleashing the full potential of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7− x (YBCO), a premier high-temperature superconductor, for devices in advanced communication technologies hinges on the refinement of its fabrication process. In this work, a synchrotron three-dimension reciprocal space mapping (3D-RSM) technique, which offers a larger Q -space range and higher spatial resolution, was developed and used to analyze YBCO films grown on (001)-oriented LAO, STO, and MgO substrates. The 3D-RSM results reveal that epitaxial YBCO c domains dominate the films, with minor YBCO a domains in YBCO/LAO. The YBCO c domains present a consistent epitaxial relationship with the substrate STO and LAO, with the domain boundary parallel to the substrate [110] or [ 1 ¯ 10] axes. In contrast, YBCO/MgO films exhibit two distinct in-plane epitaxy orientations. Quantitatively measured lattice constants indicate the possible T c -related oxygen vacancy condition therein. A 2-in. YBCO/MgO film, prepared by a homemade pulsed laser deposition system, verified the structural non-uniformity issues, suggesting room for further optimization. This study underscores the advantages of synchrotron-based 3D-RSM for microstructure analysis, which could support process improvement and performance optimization in high-frequency applications.},

  abstract     = {Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based hydrogels have received a lot of attention due to their superior biocompatibility and versatile applications. However, the fabrication of structurally complex hydrogels at high resolutions (&lt;100 μ m) remains challenging, mainly due to limitations in traditional methods such as casting and extrusion-based 3D printing. This work proposes sol-gel electrohydrodynamic direct writing (SGEHD), a facile and low-cost platform integrating thermally induced sol-gel transition with electrohydrodynamic printing for the fabrication of high-resolution PVA hydrogels. By optimizing jet stability and controlling phase transition velocity, we achieved resolutions finer than 70 μ m, surpassing the limitations of traditional PVA hydrogel fabrication techniques. This study also develops a method for the quality evaluation of deposited lines, and finally provides some examples of complex patterned gel processing with SGEHD to demonstrate the pattern fidelity of this technique.},

Optimizing the secret key rate with state parameters reveals that implementing SPS yields no benefits in improving the loss tolerance of CV-MDI-QKD. Additionally, we find that displacement too is not useful in improving the performance of CV-MDI-QKD. While our result is in contradistinction with the widely held belief in the field regarding the utility of SPS and displacement in CV-MDI-QKD, it also calls for a reexamination of the role of non-Gaussian operations in increasing the efficiency of various quantum information processing protocols.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting microwave resonators are critical to quantum computing and sensing technologies. Additionally, they are common proxies for superconducting qubits when determining the effects of performance-limiting loss mechanisms such as from two-level systems (TLSs). The extraction of these loss mechanisms is often performed by measuring the internal quality factor Q i as a function of power or temperature. In this work, we investigate large temporal fluctuations of Q i at low powers over periods of 12–16 h (relative standard deviation σ Q i / Q i = 13 % ⁠ ). These fluctuations are ubiquitous across multiple resonators, chips, and cooldowns. We are able to attribute these fluctuations to variations in the TLS loss tangent due to two main indicators. First, measured fluctuations decrease as power and temperature increase. Second, for interleaved measurements, we observe correlations between low- and medium-power Q i fluctuations and an absence of correlations with high-power fluctuations. Agreement with the TLS loss tangent mean is obtained by performing measurements over a time span of a few hours. We hypothesize that, in addition to decoherence, due to coupling to individual near-resonant TLS, superconducting qubits are affected by these observed TLS loss tangent fluctuations.},

In this study, we construct a two-dimensional (2D) multi-physics model and simulate the 2D geometry and internal electrochemical processes to investigate the multiscale effects of microstructures on overall battery performance. Concurrently, we design three distinct anode structures: porosity gradient distribution structures, hard carbon–graphite composite anodes, and hard carbon-coated graphite anodes to identify structural features that enhance key battery performance metrics. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of side-reaction products and the Li + concentration to reveal the influence of different microstructures on internal mass transport and electrochemical reactions. We also identify the factors within these three structures that contribute to extending battery lifespan and improving overall performance. This work systematically establishes the relationship between anode microstructures and battery performance, providing insights that are expected to optimize materials, reduce trial-and-error, and use simulations to guide experimental work more efficiently.},

The results indicate that the thermal losses from non-ideal ESCs significantly limit HCPC efficiency, which can be enhanced by optimizing ESC parameters.

By strategically applying step voltage signals on a 1 + 3 node single-layer bio-inspired spider network, a single disturbance or multiple disturbances were addressed under continuous external stimuli, with analyzing phase differences induced by disturbances at various locations within the network and systematically categorizing these phases to empower decision-making. These pattern differences enable precise location-resolved disturbance detection through eight encodable phase patterns and their corresponding phase-space trajectories, showcasing memristors&#39; precision in dynamic control. Additionally, amplitude changes and phase relationships between oscillators can be visually represented through color-mapped voltage values. This work opens avenues for developing intelligent, adaptive systems, advancing neuromorphic computing, and intelligent system control, offering possibilities for artificial intelligence to process complex information.},

  abstract     = {Cesium lead bromide perovskites have demonstrated enormous potential in detecting applications, benefitting from their excellent optoelectronic properties and environmental stability. However, their intrinsic properties of photoluminescence intensity and carrier lifetime, key to photodetector performance, are still limited with conventional approaches (e.g., material purification and defect passivation). Here, we propose an efficient ultrasound-assisted growth method to manipulate the crystal phase of all-inorganic perovskites. Morphological, structural, and elemental characteristics of perovskites are comprehensively investigated, confirming the formation of CsPb 2 Br 5 –CsPbBr 3 dual-phase (DP) perovskites. The fabricated DP perovskites exhibit enhanced carrier dynamics compared to CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs), including over a tenfold increase in photoluminescence intensity and an extended carrier lifetime of 656 ns. Such impressive improvements originate from the repeated radiative recombination introduced by the hierarchical phase of DP perovskites. As a result, the DP perovskite-based photodetector also demonstrates improved photoresponse, including a larger on/off ratio exceeding 10 3 and a higher detectivity of 1.48 × 10 10 Jones, especially in the absence of conventional transporting layers. These results offer strong competitiveness for state-of-the-art perovskite photodetectors and deliver important implications for the widespread use of DP perovskites in assembling high-performance optoelectronic devices.},

This work presents a graphene synaptic transistor based on all-technology-compatible materials that exhibits highly tunable biorealistic behavior. It is shown that the device geometry and interface properties can be designed to maximize the memory window and minimize power consumption. The device exhibits a virtually continuous range of multiple conductance levels, similar to synaptic weighting, which is achieved by gradual injection/emission of electrons into the floating gate and interface traps under the influence of an external electric field. Similar to the biological synapse, the transistor has short-term intrinsic dynamics that affects the long-term state. The temporal injection/emission dynamics of an electronic synapse closely resembles those of its biological counterpart and is exploited to emulate biorealistic behavior using a number of synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation/depression, spike-rate-dependent plasticity, and others. Such a synaptic transistor can serve as a building block in hardware artificial networks for advanced information processing and storage.},

  abstract     = {Light–matter interactions are of fundamental scientific and technological interest. Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Larger signals can most directly be obtained by higher repetition rates, which, however, are typically limited to a few kilohertz by the thermal relaxation of thin material films. Here, we combine nanometric electron beam probing with sample support structures tailored to facilitate rapid specimen cooling. Optical cycling of a charge-density wave transformation enables quantifying the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the heat diffusion in different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to 200 μ W/ μ m 2 within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of 2 MHz. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.},

Beyond their intriguing electrical transport phenomena, such as the negative magnetoresistance driven by the chiral anomaly and the anomalous Hall effect, they also exhibit intriguing second-order optoelectronic responses, such as the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). In this Letter, we investigate the CPGE in a class of double Weyl semimetal protected by the C 3 z T symmetry by using the effective model. Unlike double Weyl semimetal protected by C n z (n = 4, 6) symmetry, when time-reversal symmetry T is broken, one C 3 z T -protected double Weyl point (WP) evolves into four single WPs, three of which are related by C 3 z symmetry, and these WPs share the same topological charge and reside at the same energy level. This unique configuration enhances the CPGE trace due to the combined topological charge of the three WPs, resulting in a higher quantized plateau. Our findings provide promising prospects for the development of optoelectronic devices in the future.},

It is found that the partial lack of Ca between the germanene buckled layers effectively increases the Seebeck coefficient without restraining the conductivity. A maximum power factor of 170 μ W/mK 2 at 523 K, which is seven times larger than the stoichiometric CaGe 2 film, was achieved in the Ca 0.835 Ge 2 film by suppression of bipolar effect and formation of a Ca-deficient phase.

However, SPR-induced light confinement at the nanoscale also leads to significant localized heating. In this study, we investigated the impact of near-field heating due to SPR using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) and tip-enhanced photoluminescence studies. Our results reveal nearly an order-of-magnitude difference in the enhancement factors (EFs) for Raman and PL signals of monolayer MoS 2 , with a local temperature increase of approximately 147 °C under the TERS tip at a laser power of 10.57 mW. The reduced PL EF compared with Raman EF is attributed to additional near-field heating from SPR. We further observed that local temperature fluctuations critically affect the EFs and found that a high thermal conductivity substrate can effectively mitigate the near-field thermal effects associated with SPR.},

However, the growth of KNN-based single crystals is restricted by their high melting point and harsh equipment conditions. In this work, a large-sized single crystal of (K 0.5 Na 0.5 ) 0.994 Bi 0.006 Nb 0.998 Cu 0.004 O 3 (KNNBC) was grown using an inexpensive and simple seed-free solid state crystal growth method. The growth mechanism, domain structures, defects, piezoelectric properties, as well as the conduction mechanisms of the KNNBC single crystal were systematically investigated. A significant piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) as high as 392 pC/N is obtained in the KNNBC single crystal, which is three times higher than that of ceramics with the same composition, and the single crystal also maintains a high Curie temperature ( T c ∼ 399 °C). The superior piezoelectric properties are believed to stem from the ordered arrangement of large-sized striped domains (∼300 nm) and the sensitivity to polarization rotation due to the flattening of the Landau energy density. Additionally, the spontaneous polarization combined with complex defect dipoles consisting of Cu 2+ ions and O 2− vacancies effectively modulates both the quality factor ( Q m ) and the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) of the single crystals. This work broadens the growth strategy of high-performance KNN-based single crystals and highlights the great benefits of the synergistic modulation of defects and domains on the piezoelectric properties of single crystals.},

However, practical implementation remains challenging due to the limited control over valleytronic properties. Here, we propose ferroelectric HfCl 2 /Sc 2 CO 2 van der Waals heterostructure as a platform to overcome these limitations, enabling tunable and nonvolatile valleytronic behaviors. Our findings show that the electric polarization state of the Sc 2 CO 2 monolayer governs the electronic properties of heterostructures. Positive polarization induces a direct gap at the valleys, enabling valleytronic functionality for excitation and readout via circularly polarized light, while negative polarization results in an indirect-gap, suppressing valleytronic behavior. Moreover, our transport simulations further demonstrate a polarization-dependent ferroelectric p-i-n junction with 8 nm possesses a maximum tunnel electroresistance (TER) ratio of 1.60 × 10 8 % at a bias of 0.5 eV. These results provide insights into ferroelectric-controlled valleytronic transitions and position the HfCl 2 /Sc 2 CO 2 heterostructure as a promising candidate for energy-efficient valleytronic memory and nonvolatile storage applications.},

  abstract     = {Although the performance of BiFeO 3 (BFO) films has been extensively and deeply studied, further exploration is still needed to understand the correlation between a ferroelectric single domain and high performance in BFO single crystals. Therefore, we conduct the biased in situ transmission electron microscopy experiments on the electrical transport properties of BFO single crystals with single domains. The in situ measured I – V curves indicate neither one-way conduction nor resistance switching. The conductive behavior of BFO corresponds to space charge-limited conduction, indicating a high concentration of oxygen vacancies and the presence of Ohmic contact between the Pt electrode and BFO. After applying a DC constant voltage, the resistance decreases by approximately 50% and partially recovers after exposure to air. The electron energy loss spectroscopy spectra under different conditions indicate that BFO interacts with the external environment. Specifically, DC voltage causes BFO to release oxygen atoms, resulting in an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration and decrease in resistance. Air oxidation leads to a decrease in oxygen vacancy concentration and partial recovery of resistance. In addition, in situ heating experiments (at 20–400 °C) indicate that oxygen vacancies mainly originate from the external electric field rather than thermal effects.},

  abstract     = {The experimentally observed 2D magnets have unlocked the possibility of realizing a stable long-range order in the low-dimensional limit, which also gives a boost to the family of 1D magnets. Recently, a family of Fe-based nanowires has been observed in high-throughput transition metal chalcogenides synthesized by chemical vapor deposition [Zhou et al. , Nat. Mater. 22 , 450–458 (2023)]. In this work, the atomic configuration, chemical composition, and magnetic properties of Fe 3 X 4 (X = S, Se, Te) nanowires were confirmed by first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Due to their intrinsic anisotropic character and strong d-p hybridization, Fe 3 X 4 nanowires exhibit antiferromagnetic semiconducting behavior with good stability, a tunable bandgap of 0.277–0.771 eV, a large vertical magnetic anisotropy energy of 2.39 meV/Fe, and a high Néel temperature of 680–840 K. Moreover, the calculation of the spin transport properties has shown that these Fe 3 X 4 nanowires possess the negative differential resistance behavior with the peak-to-valley current ratio from 1.84 to 6.85. Our results not only expand the database of magnetic nanowires but also provide a low-dimensional platform for multifunctional spin devices.},

  abstract     = {The inverse spinel oxide NiCo 2 O 4 , known for its high Curie temperature, low resistivity, and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, is a promising candidate for the development of next-generation spintronic devices. However, reducing the thickness of the NiCo 2 O 4 film to a few atomic layers degrades its room temperature magnetic and electrical properties, limiting its practical application. In this study, a Co 3 O 4 buffer layer is introduced into ultrathin NiCo 2 O 4 films, which significantly enhances the Curie temperature beyond room temperature and reduces the resistivity, while preserving the strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as well as the robust anomalous Hall effect. It is found that the sheet resistance dramatically decreases with the increase in Co 3 O 4 thickness. The observed phenomena may originate from the increased occupation of Ni 3+ ions at octahedral sites due to the interfacial coupling, resulting in the intrinsic linear relationship between resistivity and Curie temperature. Additionally, the scaling relation between the anomalous Hall conductivity and longitudinal conductivity highlights the complex interaction between spin-dependent impurity scattering and the band intrinsic Berry curvature. This study indicates that interfacial coupling is an effective strategy for tuning the physical properties of oxides, providing a promising avenue for the application of NiCo 2 O 4 -based materials in miniaturized spintronic devices.},

However, if we consider an asymmetric magnetic field, the degeneracy of the SW bands is lifted due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. In this case, we obtain the polarization-dependent SW channels. Furthermore, we show that the tuning of SW band structures both in frequency and momentum spaces can be realized with the help of Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction.

Here, we report the SOT switching in the [Co/Ni] × n multilayers with maze domain structures. The experimental results show that the SOT switching efficiency strongly depends on the magnetic structure of the ferromagnet (FM) layer. With the increase in cycle number of [Co/Ni] × n multilayers, the switching ratio rapidly decreases, even cannot present the magnetization switching. This switching behavior can be attributed to the strong domain wall pinning in the samples with the maze domain structure. Moreover, although the samples in this work have the same spin current sources, the estimated SOT efficiencies vary greatly, suggesting that the SOT efficiency in a FM/heavy metal (HM) structure depends not only on the spin Hall effect and/or Rashba effect but also on the magnetic structure of FM layer. This work provides a better understanding for the nature of SOT switching in the FM/HM heterostructures with maze domain.},

  abstract     = {During the grain boundary diffusion (GBD) of Tb, the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures are the two main microstructures influencing the magnetic properties of the sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets. These two microstructures are all composed of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B phase, but the formation mechanisms are different. The difference in formation mechanism of the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures was studied by quenching the magnets at different temperatures and holding times. The (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell of the core–shell structure is the precondition for forming the reverse core–shell structure. The triple-junction phases (TJPs) area change proves that the Nd elements diffuse from the TJPs to the surface of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell to form the Tb-poor shell in the reverse core–shell structure and the Gaussian distribution of Tb in the shell of the core–shell structure. In addition, the difference in the Tb content distribution leads to different demagnetization processes, resulting in the opposite effect of these two microstructures on the coercivity. The GBD aims to increase the entire coercivity by enhancing the surface anisotropy field ( H A ), such as the Tb-rich shell for the grains and the Tb-rich surface (∼200 μ m) for the magnets. Therefore, for the reverse core–shell structure forming in the surface of the magnets, the surface with a low H A decreases the coercivity of the grains, reducing the coercivity of the magnets.},

Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that monolayer Cr 2 Te 2 exhibits intrinsic dynamic/thermal stability, half-metallicity, and robust ferromagnetic ordering. The Curie temperature ( T c ) can be elevated from 90 to 190 K via external stimuli. Strain engineering, carrier doping, and electric-fields enable precise control of MAE, while tensile strain and electron doping enhance MAE to 2.680 meV. Conversely, compressive strain and hole doping induce a spin reorientation transition. Moreover, external electric fields also play a key role in determining MAE, suggesting a promising strategy for manipulating MAE in 2D ferromagnets. These modifications primarily arise from the alternations of the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) strength between Te-derived p -orbitals within specific spin channels. These findings establish Cr 2 Te 2 as a versatile platform for spintronics integrating half-metallicity with dynamically adjustable magnetic properties and motivate further experimental exploration.},

From the ST-FMR results, it is found that a relatively large out-of-plane anti-damping torque can be obtained in Ni/Mn bilayers. The Gilbert damping constant, derived from the resonant linewidth of frequency-dependent ST-FMR experiments, decreases almost linearly with increasing thickness of Mn, further indicating the out-of-plane anti-damping torque in Ni/Mn bilayer systems. The origin of this torque can be attributed to the orbital Rashba–Edelstein effect. Furthermore, the orbital diffusion length ( ⁠ λ L ⁠ ) in Mn is determined to be more than 17 nm and larger than spin diffusion length, suggesting that the torque observed in our sample is predominantly influenced by the orbital-related effect. Finally, the insertion of Pt in a Ni/Mn bilayer system significantly enhances the orbital-to-spin conversion efficiency.

  abstract     = {Understanding thermal transport behaviors across dissimilar metal films is essential for optimizing electronic devices&#39; performance and efficiency. However, the effect of interfacial parameters such as the thickness on interfacial thermal conductance ( G ) of metal/metal remains elusive. In this Letter, the G between Al and Cu with varying Cu thickness was investigated from 78 to 295 K using the time domain thermoreflectance technique combined with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and the diffuse mismatch model (DMM). The temperature dependence of G Al/Cu follows a pattern that is consistent with phonon-related thermal transport behaviors and decreases with increasing Cu thickness. The phonon related behaviors are attributed to the existence of the oxide layer at the interface. By taking the oxide layer into account, NEMD and DMM calculations match well with the experimental results, proving that the oxide layer hinders electron transport across the interface. We further find that strain distributions in Cu layers have a negative correlation with Cu thickness. When applying compressive strain on Cu, the overlap of phonon density of states between Cu and Al increases, especially for phonons of 6.5–9 THz, which is responsible for the Cu thickness-dependence in G Al/Cu . Our results not only help revealing strain effect on G but also pave the way for the thermal design of metal interconnect in integrated circuits.},

Although direct bonding of Si films to SiC substrates demonstrates many advantages over epitaxial growth, different bonding techniques may yield disparate bonding qualities and heat dissipation abilities. Here, a comparative analysis from thermal-mechanical-structural perspectives of different Si/SiC interfaces, prepared by hydrophilic bonding (HB) and surface-activated bonding (SAB) methods, is systematically conducted. It was found that the amorphous interlayer thickness and thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of the SAB-Si/SiC heterojunction can be significantly modulated by annealing, accompanied by a beneficial decreased TBR at high working temperatures. Moreover, the residual stress within the Si film by SAB is greatly reduced to an order of magnitude lower than that by HB. In general, the SAB-Si/SiC interface exhibits a tunable microstructure, comparably low TBR, and nearly fully relaxed stress, potentially outperforming the HB-Si/SiC interface when considering the comprehensive performance. This work puts forward an important thermal-mechanical perspective to evaluate interface bonding quality for practical applications, and removes a headache barrier toward wafer-scale high-yield integration of Si active layers onto SiC substrates to greatly enhance SOI devices&#39; thermal management.},

This study systematically investigated the electrical properties, microstructure, elemental valence states, and energy-band alignment of these heterojunctions through multiple analytical techniques. Current–voltage measurements revealed an asymmetric, nonlinear behavior due to the depletion region at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface, with annealing further enhancing electrical performance by yielding a lower turn-on voltage of 0.3 V, an increased rectification ratio of 81.1, and a reduced ideality factor of 6.69. Band structure analysis showed that both the conduction band offset and valence band offset at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface increase, indicating a higher barrier height, resulting in more pronounced rectification behavior. X-ray diffraction showed that the laser-treated samples have polycrystalline structures, and annealing improved the crystallinity, thereby enhancing the conductivity. Furthermore, secondary ion mass spectroscopy confirmed the deep implantation of high concentrations of Cu ions into ZnO. Depth‐profiling x‐ray photoelectron spectra revealed the co-presence of Cu + and Cu 2+ , both of which contribute to the p -type conductivity. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing ZnO heterojunctions in applications such as light-emitting diodes and laser diodes with a high level of efficiency and low turn-on voltage.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the efficiency and performance of p -type GaN-based power devices (diode, MOSFET) and p-channel transistors (p-FET), forming an Ohmic contact with low specific contact resistance ( ⁠ ρ c ⁠ ) at p-GaN can be an effective way. However, the specific contact resistance values of p-GaN remain limited to the range of mid-10 −2 Ω cm 2 due to the low activation ratio of Mg dopants and high work function. Here, we propose an Ohmic contact method using a Pd-based metal stack to achieve lower specific contact resistance compared to conventional p-GaN contact metals such as Ni/Au or Pt/Au. A low specific contact resistance of 1.08 × 10 −5 Ω cm 2 was demonstrated for p-GaN by annealing a Pd-based tri-layer metal contact in an oxygen-rich ambient with an optimized Pd thickness. The mechanism driving this low specific contact resistance was investigated using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicated the mutual diffusion of Ni, Pd, and Ga atoms within the metal alloy. A NiO layer was formed on the top of the metal alloy, and Pd-Ga compounds were formed at the metal/p-GaN interface through mutual diffusion of atoms. This process increased the number of Ga vacancies in p-GaN, playing a crucial role in reducing its contact resistance.},

However, the insufficient light absorption capacity and low photoelectric conversion efficiency of InGaN-based pin heterojunction hinder the realization of high-sensitivity PDs for achieving this aim. Herein, plasmonic PDs based on InGaN/GaN multi-quantum wells (MQW) heterojunction with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) have been experimentally implemented, showing balanced abilities of enhanced photoresponse and polarization sensitivity in the blue light region. The PD&#39;s optimized responsivity, detectivity, and anisotropy ratio reach 0.176 A/W, 1.93 × 10 10 Jones, and 1.395, respectively, under 405 nm illumination. The surface plasmon resonance-induced local field of Ag NPs enhances the electric field density and the light absorption density in the heterojunction region of InGaN/GaN MQWs, improving the photoresponse of PDs. This work proposes a valuable strategy for designing high-performance visible light PDs, providing an attractive stage for high-efficiency visible light communication applications.},

However, they face significant challenges in processing temporal data because of the lack of inherent temporal dynamics, limiting their application in reservoir computing (RC) systems. Here, we have developed a simple two-terminal PV neuromorphic device based on an indium tin oxide/Nb-SrTiO 3 oxide Schottky heterojunction, which features multi-level PV responses by adjusting the built-in electric field. The spontaneous recapture of electrons by charged defects leads to relaxation of the built-in electric field over time, providing inherent temporal dynamics for the PV device. Using this device, we designed a RC system that achieved high-accurate recognition of image letters and spoken-digits. This work offers an efficacious approach to design neuromorphic devices that combine temporal dynamics with low-energy consumption.},

Here, vertical Bridgman grown CsPbBr 3 single crystal has been used to measure the mobility accurately using pulse-biased time-of-flight method. The hole mobility for CsPbBr 3 at room temperature is modest to be around 25 cm 2 /(V · s). The value of the corresponding power-law index n for hole mobility on temperature (μ ∼ T -n ) is around −1.23 in the range of 155–350 K, which is well consistent with the previous FET and Hall effect measurements, as well as theoretical calculations. The polar optical phonon rather than acoustic phonon is confirmed to be responsible for scattering carriers at room temperature. Our study gives solid evidence on the modest mobility in the intrinsic (not dominated by defects) CsPbBr 3 semiconductor, which may limit the application of CsPbBr 3 in high flux photon counting detectors.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the impact of constant forward electrical stress on beta-gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) from the prospective of defect evolution. Prolonged stress significantly increased the reverse leakage current density ( J R ) and forward current density ( J F ) under small bias and decreased the turn-on voltage ( V on ). Temperature-dependent current-voltage ( I-V-T ) analysis revealed that the reverse leakage current is dominated by Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission in both fresh and stressed SBDs, while the forward current transport mechanism transforms from thermionic emission (TE) to trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) after stress. Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) results identified an intrinsic trap E 2 * (E C - 0.75 eV) within the β -Ga 2 O 3 drift layer, which is likely a Ga vacancy-related trap. The consistency of this energy level with the PF barrier proves that the increase in this trap is the main reason for the increase in J R . The spatial distribution features that the increase in trap concentration near the metal-semiconductor interface is much larger than that inside the bulk, which establishes the association between this trap and J F under small bias and V on . These findings highlight the critical role of trap evolution in SBD performance degradation under electrical stress.},

Featuring a 7 nm AlN barrier layer and the regrown n + -GaN Ohmic contacts, the device shows low sheet and contact resistances, leading to 1.6-A/mm output current, 3-V knee voltage, and consequent 75% power-added efficiency (PAE) and 1.3-W/mm output power density ( P out ) at 2.6 GHz and 6-V drain voltage ( V DS ). This PAE- P out result represents the state-of-the-art levels of low-voltage power amplifiers (LV PAs) for sub-6G applications. Meanwhile, the TAB-HEMT is found to exhibit satisfactory linearity and noise performance as well. The OIP3 (output third-order intercept point) value of 35.3 dBm is obtained at 6-V V DS , thanks to the elaborately designed thick AlN barrier. A minimum noise figure ( NF min ) as low as 0.32 dB at 2.6 GHz and V DS = 6 V is achieved thanks to the suppressed thermal noise enabled by low channel resistance.

A series of sharp endothermic and exothermic peaks are observed during the temperature ramping process. In contrast to the abrupt and complete transformation typically observed in conventional insulator-to-metal transitions, our findings reveal a scenario in which multiple domains coexist, and phase transitions occur sequentially within each domain. These results underscore the intricate relationship between domain dynamics and the multiple phase structures in VO 2 .

In this study, two kinds of LARHEAs with chemical compositions of TiZrTaCr and TiZrTaV in equal atomic percentage were designed based on low neutron absorption cross section, low neutron activation, and mixing enthalpy parameters. The LARHEA samples were prepared by high vacuum arc-melting techniques, and their phase structures and mechanical properties were studied. It was found that the TiZrTaCr LARHEA exhibited two body-center-cubic (BCC) and one Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound phases, and it had a yield strength of 1364 ± 54 MPa, but it was brittle, while the TiZrTaV LARHEA formed three BCC solid solution phases, and it had a high yield strength of 1312 ± 57 MPa with a room temperature compression plasticity of 13% ± 0.8%. Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound formation in the solid solution matrix could have led to the brittleness of the LARHEAs, which was mainly due to the large negative mixing enthalpy of the Cr element with Zr element in this alloy system. This study proposed a basic method for LARHEA design to optimize the microstructures and improve the mechanical properties as structural materials.},

  abstract     = {The controllability of the spectral width and intensity of long-wave infrared (LWIR) emission is essential for various applications, including optical stealth, infrared radiation sources, and infrared lasers. Here, we proposed a multifunctional LWIR metasurface emitter with a switchable radiation state, which consists of germanium (Ge) rectangular pair resonators placed on a vanadium oxide (VO 2 ) film. By manipulating the reversible metal-to-insulator phase transition of phase change material VO 2 , the spatial and spectral emission characteristics could be dynamically controlled. The high loss of metallic VO 2 enables broadband emission in the LWIR band. The average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range reaches 91.3% and exhibits wide-angle emission properties. When the VO 2 is transformed to the insulating phase, the coupling effect of the symmetry-breaking rectangle with two quasi-bound states in the continuum modes enhances the emission intensity of VO 2 at a selective wavelength. This results in narrowband emission with a high-quality factor (Q-factor) and high directional selectivity. Notably, the emission peak&#39;s linewidth is only 28 nm, with a Q-factor of 293, and the average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range drops to 9.4%. Overall, the proposed metasurface device achieves an LWIR emissivity switching ratio of 9.7 between its two operating modes, showcasing significant differences in spectral and spatial radiation characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Open stopband (OSB) mitigation techniques are commonly used to improve the far-field radiating properties of leaky-wave antennas based on periodic structures. Recently, leaky waves have been proposed to focus energy in the near field through Bessel beams. However, the focusing character of Bessel beams is notably limited to a maximum distance known as the nondiffractive range . In this work, an OSB mitigation technique is originally exploited to significantly extend the nondiffractive range of a Bessel beam generated by a leaky-wave launcher in the microwave/millimeter-wave range. A comprehensive analysis of this device is presented, comparing the performance of the proposed launcher with the typical structure of a leaky-wave Bessel-beam launcher where the OSB is not suppressed. Theoretical results, corroborated by full-wave simulations, demonstrate that the proposed device achieves an impressive nondiffractive range of about 25 m. The latter, at 30 GHz, approximately corresponds to 2500 wavelengths (in vacuum) and to 50 times the aperture diameter which is about 50 cm. These results look particularly attractive for, e.g., near-field communications and wireless power transfer applications, where focusing energy in narrow regions and over large distances is a key factor.},

  abstract     = {Chiral metasurfaces exhibit vast application prospects in near-field imaging, polarization conversion, and chiral sensing. In this work, we theoretically propose a temperature-tunable terahertz (THz) chiral absorber based on a metasurface of Ag–VO 2 nested split-rings. Perfect absorption of left-handed circularly polarized light (LCP) exceeding 99% and weak absorption of only about 6% of right-handed circularly polarized light (RCP) are achieved at 7.24 THz in frequency. The discrepancy in absorption responses of LCP and RCP results in a large circular dichroism (CD) of 0.94. The CD value in the THz region can be actively modulated between 0.02 and 0.94 by controlling the phase transition of VO 2 , which is closely related to the ambient temperature. Moreover, near-field imaging and encrypted presentation are realized by leveraging the metasurface and its mirror-image properties. Our work holds significant promise in widespread fields including THz intelligent absorption, imaging, and chiral detection.},

  abstract     = {Polarization is one of the basic properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves, and polarization conversion is essential in many terahertz (THz) applications, including communications and sensitive measurements. Due to the limitations of the materials and process, existing THz polarization converters generally have the disadvantages of narrow operating frequency band and non-flexibility. We experimentally demonstrate a flexible ultra-broadband THz polarization converter operating in reflection. It can efficiently convert a linearly polarized THz wave to its orthogonal counterpart in a broadband regime. The device consists of three layers: the lower metal film, the middle dielectric layer, and the upper metal resonance structure array. The unit cell of the upper metal resonance structure is a four-open-ring formed by subtracting two metal bars from a metal ring. The position of the opening is in the diagonal direction of 45° from the upper right corner to the lower left corner of the unit structure. The device is simulated using a full wave EM simulation software and fabricated by a surface micromachining process. The test experiment is completed using a THz-TDS spectrometer and the results show that the polarization conversion ratio is more than 0.8 in an ultra-broadband regime from 1.45 to 2.67 THz. This ultra-broadband conversion is mainly caused by the magnetic resonance of THz waves. More importantly, the convertible frequency band can be tailored for practical applications across the EM spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Drop impact on non-wetting surfaces has garnered significant interest due to its potential applications in water repellency, drag reduction, self-cleaning, and anti-icing. However, there are instances where a droplet fails to rebound from a superhydrophobic surface. It has been reported that the combined effect of gravito-capillary length and visco-capillary length determines the pinning–bouncing criteria. While the fluid properties, such as viscosity and weight, are often considered primary factors influencing droplet rebound, this study highlights the crucial role of surface characteristics, particularly the contact angle hysteresis, in determining post-impact behavior. We propose a modified criterion that predicts droplet bouncing and pinning on superhydrophobic surfaces by integrating both fluid properties and the contact angle hysteresis of the surface. The findings emphasize the importance of surface morphology in droplet dynamics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of droplet behavior on non-wetting surfaces.},

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the Si NWs and SiGe cladding morphology. The results demonstrate that the morphology of SiGe cladding can be controlled by adjusting the high-temperature H 2 baking conditions, leading to shapes such as triangular, circular, and hexagonal. Technology computer-aided design simulations and geometric phase analysis of TEM images revealed that the maximum compressive stress of SiGe cladding is 3 GPa, corresponding to a compressive strain of 2.48%, which significantly enhances hole mobility. Electrical performance tests and simulations on p -type metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor devices with different morphologies showed excellent short-channel effect control, with a subthreshold swing (SS) of approximately 70 mV/dec and a drain-induced barrier lowering of only 40 mV/V. These findings provide valuable guidelines for fabricating high-quality SiGe channels with controlled structures, enabling the realization of high carrier mobilities in future devices.},

In this study, we report a strategy using functionally graded lattice structures (FGLS) to manipulate the multipactor of the ceramic surface. First, particle-in-cell simulations were conducted to study the secondary electron avalanche process. Simulation results indicated that the interaction between electrons and FGLS hinders the development of secondary electron avalanche. Also, a few positive charges can be accumulated on the ceramic surface since FGLS eliminates the macroscopic interface between insulators and vacuum. Subsequently, stereolithography 3D printing technology was adopted to fabricate ceramic insulators with FGLS, and a further experimental characterization verifies the reduction of secondary electron yield, especially for surfaces with finer structures.},

  abstract     = {We report on the fabrication and characterization of p–n diodes made from wide bandgap II-VI semiconductors (p-ZnTe/n-CdTe) containing nano-inclusions of narrow bandgap material (PbTe). The diodes are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy on semi-insulating GaAs (100) substrates. The PbTe nano-inclusions are formed either as a single layer of PbTe with a thickness of 350 nm or as multilayers built from alternating thin layers of PbTe and CdTe. Comparison of cross-sectional scanning electron microscope images with electron beam-induced current measurements confirms that the PbTe nano-inclusions are located in depletion regions of the diodes. Despite the presence of the highly conductive, narrow bandgap PbTe semiconductor between the p- an n-type layers, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices show rectifying behavior and acceptable diode parameters in the wide temperature range of 60–290 K. The p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes with PbTe nano-inclusions exhibit significant sensitivity to infrared radiation starting at the wavelength of about 1.5 μ m and with a long-wavelength cutoff of 3.9 and 5.4 μ m at 290 and 50 K, respectively. A peak sensitivity appears at a wavelength of 2.29 μ m and reaches the maximum of almost 1 V/W at a temperature of 150 K. The temperature dependence of the cutoff wavelength clearly shows that the sensitivity to infrared radiation of the wide bandgap p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes is due to band-to-band optical excitations taking place in PbTe nano-inclusions. The results presented here prove that such diodes can be used for infrared sensing or for two-color infrared solar cells.},
