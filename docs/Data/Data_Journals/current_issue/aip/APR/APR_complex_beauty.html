  abstract     = {Developing new organic crystals for efficient broad terahertz (THz) wave generation remains challenging, as multiple critical material properties must be achieved simultaneously within a single crystal. In this work, we introduce a new series of organic nonlinear optical salt crystals tailored for THz wave generators. The newly designed fluorinated cationic chromophore, 6-fluoro-2-(4-hydroxystyryl)-1-methylquinolinium (OH6FQ), has been incorporated with various fluorinated or non-fluorinated anions into six different ionic crystals. Notably, the tetrafluorinated crystals, composed of fluorinated OH6FQ cations and trifluorinated anions, meet essential requirements for efficient THz wave generation, including large macroscopic optical nonlinearity, optimal facet orientation in as-grown crystals with mm-size, plate-like morphology, and relatively low THz absorption across both the entire-molecular phonon and anion-stretching vibration regions. These tetrafluorinated crystals exhibit over 20 times higher optical-to-THz amplitude conversion efficiency compared to inorganic ZnTe, with a broad bandwidth extending up to 16 THz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of tetrafluorinated ionic organic THz crystals, showing promising potential for diverse THz photonic and nonlinear optical applications.},

  abstract     = {It is thought that schemes for quantum imaging are fragile against realistic environments in which the background noise is often stronger than the nonclassical signal of the imaging photons. Unfortunately, it is unfeasible to produce brighter quantum light sources to alleviate this problem. Here, we overcome this paradigmatic limitation by developing a quantum imaging scheme that relies on the use of natural sources of light. This is achieved by performing conditional detection on the photon number of the thermal light field scattered by a remote object. Specifically, the conditional measurements in our scheme enable us to extract quantum features of the detected thermal photons to produce quantum images with improved signal-to-noise ratios. This technique shows an exponential enhancement in the contrast of quantum images. This measurement scheme enables the possibility of producing images from the vacuum fluctuations of the light field. This is experimentally demonstrated through the implementation of a single-pixel camera with photon-number-resolving capabilities. As such, we believe that our scheme opens a new paradigm in the field of quantum imaging. It also unveils the potential of combining natural light sources with nonclassical detection schemes for the development of robust quantum technologies.},

Here, we establish for the first time the intrinsic evolution laws of Fabry–Pérot bound states in the continuum (FP-BICs), revealing that the Q factor is inversely proportional to the square of phase/frequency detuning and to the nonradiative decay rate, enabling directional engineering of FP-BIC resonances. We propose an all-dielectric multilayer film metasurface to create an optical resonator and its perfectly mirrored counterpart, inducing FP-BICs and validating the conclusions. We experimentally demonstrated the evolution of the Q factor with frequency detuning, achieving a maximum Q factor of 610 in the visible. Our work offers novel insights into BICs, promising to inspire exotic phenomena and applications.},

  abstract     = {Controlling and enhancing light–matter coupling at subwavelength scales is an essential requirement in the realm of meta-photonics. Recently, all-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs) governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a standout platform for delivering high-quality (Q) factor resonances and near-field electromagnetic hotspots. However, in the terahertz (THz) domain, experimental validation of high-Q BICs resonances with strong robustness and advanced maneuverability in such all-dielectric photonic systems remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and feasible fabrication approach to unlock the full potential of BICs-inspired resonances within the array of silicon cross elliptical resonators. Our results suggest that the designed THz-MS can support two symmetry-protected BICs with a topological charge of ±1 and several accidental BICs with a topological charge of +1 simultaneously. By introducing small perturbations to the individual resonator, the original two symmetry-protected BICs transform into quasi-BICs that bow to the inverse-square law. Astoundingly, for larger symmetry breaking, two additional BICs can be observed in the asymmetric THz-MSs surpass typical inverse-square rule, hence presenting a supererogatory degree of freedom for tailoring BICs resonances on demand. We bear out theoretical findings by transmission experiments implemented on the fabricated samples. We observe experimentally ultrasharp dual quasi-BICs resonances with a highest measured Q factor of up to 371, a level of performance that was previously unattainable with all-dielectric THz-MS on a substrate. The results mark an important step toward enriching the family of BICs and promise exciting opportunities in the field of THz optoelectronic devices and metadevices.},

  abstract     = {The obtention of quantum-grade rare-earth-doped oxide thin films that can be integrated with optical cavities and microwave resonators is of great interest for the development of scalable quantum devices. Among the different growth methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers high flexibility and has demonstrated the ability to produce oxide films hosting rare-earth ions with narrow linewidths. However, growing epitaxial films directly on silicon is challenging by CVD due to a native amorphous oxide layer formation at the interface. In this manuscript, we investigate the CVD growth of erbium-doped yttrium oxide (Er:Y 2 O 3 ) thin films on different substrates, including silicon, sapphire, quartz, or yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Alternatively, growth was also attempted on an epitaxial Y 2 O 3 template layer on Si (111) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to circumvent the issue of the amorphous interlayer. We found that the substrate impacts the film morphology and the crystalline orientations, with different textures observed for the CVD film on the MBE-oxide/Si template (111) and epitaxial growth on YSZ (001). In terms of optical properties, Er 3+ ions exhibit visible and IR emission features that are comparable for all samples, indicating a high-quality local crystalline environment regardless of the substrate. Our approach opens interesting prospects to integrate such films into scalable devices for optical quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Solar-blind UV polarization detection and imaging can reflect more detailed optical information, which is vital for developing next-generation deep UV optoelectronic devices. β-Ga 2 O 3 with ultra-wide bandgap is an ideal candidate for solar-blind UV detection application. However, the bulky nature of Ga 2 O 3 limits its application in miniaturized, integrated and multifunctional devices, and polarization imaging based on Ga 2 O 3 photodetector has not yet been realized. Here, we report a convenient method to prepare 2D β-Ga 2 O 3 flakes via liquid-metal-assisted exfoliation. Benefiting from high crystallinity and polarization-sensitive absorption of prepared ultrathin β-Ga 2 O 3 flake in monoclinic structure, the β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetector exhibits an ultra-fast response speed (100/78 μ s for rise/decay time) and a prominent anisotropy ratio (∼2.8) of polarization photoresponse under 265 nm illumination. An unambiguous detection of linearly polarized light has also been realized by the double symmetry-breaking of twisted β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetectors. Moreover, a four-layer twistedly stacked detection system further enables a one-step and well-defined polarization imaging with high resolution (150 × 150 pixels) to acquire spatial polarization information. This work presents a novel strategy for preparing ultrathin 2D gallium oxides and demonstrates a promising route to realize well-defined solar-blind polarization imaging in a simple manner.},

  abstract     = {The proximity effect has long been recognized as the primary driver of static transport behavior in superconductor/ferromagnetic heterostructures, yet the understanding of magnetic dynamics in this context remains limited. Here, we demonstrate a significant shift of ferromagnetic resonance spectra in ferromagnetic films placed between two superconductor gating layers. Through deliberate modifications of the interface structure using various insertion layers, we have determined that the superconducting proximity effect has a minimal impact on the modulation of ferromagnetic resonance characteristics. Instead, our findings strongly support very recent theoretical predictions that emphasize the phenomenon of ultrastrong coupling between Kittel magnons and Cooper pairs arising from the superconducting magnetoelectric effect. We propose that this ultrastrong coupling not only provides a precise method for determining superconducting parameters like the London penetration depth but also lays the foundation for the manipulation of spin waves through superconductors in future magnonic circuits.},

Here, we report a fabrication method of optoelectrical probes for precise modulation of neurons. A linear array of flip-chipped green resonant-cavity μ LEDs (RCLED) with an emitting aperture of 50 μ m is integrated on Si platform as the stimulation source. Due to the top/bottom Bragg reflectors, the RCLEDs&#39; output light view-angle is narrowed to &lt;90°. The emission wavelength demonstrates remarkable stability under various injection current densities. Under the 50 A/cm 2 driving current density, the RCLEDs&#39; output optical density is 100 mW/mm 2 and maximum temperature rise is 0.5 °C, both of which exhibit great improvement compared with those of the optical probes on sapphire substrate.

  abstract     = {As an effective method for thermal management technologies, doping or substitution has been extensively utilized to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of various materials. Intensive studies have been conducted about the phonon mechanism of isoelectronic alloying since the 1950s. Very recently, the specific role of aliovalent doping was elucidated in the half-Heusler NbFeSb system. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally investigated the mechanism of reducing thermal conductivity through aliovalent doping by combining first-principles calculations and neutron diffraction studies for the case study of the TiCoSb half-Heusler system. The softening of the acoustic branches induced by aliovalent doping can effectively reduce the phonon group velocities. Moreover, the introduction of compensating defects, resulting from changes in the Fermi level, plays a vital role in decreasing the relaxation time of phonons, as demonstrated by the analysis of neutron powder diffraction. Due to these two factors, doping with adjacent elements results in a significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity (for instance, Ni doping at the Co site in the TiCoSb half-Heusler system), especially in the low-temperature range. Our findings provide valuable insight into the phonon scattering mechanism in aliovalent-doped materials and demonstrate the role of compensating defects in heat transport, which is applicable to other doped semiconductor systems.},

The untethered nature and size of these robots enhance maneuverability and accessibility within complex vascular networks, potentially improving clot removal efficiency. We explore mechanical fragmentation, chemical lysis, and hybrid dissolution techniques that combine mechanical fragmentation with chemical lysis, highlighting their potential for targeted and efficient blood clot removal. Through experimental validation using an ex vivo endovascular thrombosis model within the iliac artery of a sheep, we demonstrate direct revascularization of a 13-mm-long, 1-day-old blood clot positioned inside the left common iliac artery. This was achieved by deploying a UMR into the abdominal aorta within 15 min. Additionally, both mechanical fragmentation and hybrid dissolution achieve a greater volume rate of change compared to no intervention (control) and chemical lysis alone. Mechanical fragmentation exhibits clot removal with a median of 0.87 mm 3 /min and a range of 2.81 mm 3 /min, while the hybrid approach demonstrates slower but more consistent clot removal, with a median of 0.45 mm 3 /min and a range of 0.23 mm 3 /min.},

  abstract     = {Phototransistors have great application prospects in automotive vehicle, smart home, healthcare, imaging, and display. However, so far, there has been no report of flexible phototransistors that simultaneously achieve both high mobility and detectivity. Additionally, phototransistors are conventionally relied on thick channel layers and previous thin channel layers based devices only show poor performance. Here, we report flexible phototransistors based on ultrathin niobium-doped indium oxide (InNbO, 5 nm)/indium tin oxide (ITO, 3 nm) channel layers, which possess high mobility (49.21 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and high detectivity (3.02 × 10 14 Jones) simultaneously. Significantly, the devices offer a broad spectral responsivity (from violet to green emissions). We postulate that the high mobility can be ascribed to the diffusion of Sn atoms (from ITO) and conduction band offset (between InNbO and ITO), while the high detectivity originates from the low dark current. To illustrate the capabilities of flexible phototransistors, we demonstrate both a flexible active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display pixel circuit and an imaging system. Our approach unlocks new possibilities to achieve flexible phototransistors with superior performance, which suggest a great potential in next-generation flexible, stretchable, bendable, and low-cost electronics.},

  abstract     = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a prominent branch of non-linear optics (NLO) heavily reliant on conventional bulk NLO crystals. However, the difficulty in downsizing these crystals imposes technical limitations on the future of miniaturized NLO devices. Tellurene emerges as a promising candidate to overcome these restrictions, excelling in electrical applications and believed to possess a giant second-order optical susceptibility comparable to conventional NLO crystals. In this study, a face-to-face substrate configuration is employed for the synthesis of ultrathin tellurene via PVD. Our findings reveal that tellurene&#39;s SHG performance surpasses that of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides by two orders of magnitude, with maximum efficiency when the flake thickness is between 16 and 20 nm under various wavelengths. High sensitivity to thickness variation encourages post-growth thinning through hydrogen plasma etching, enabling precise engineering of the flake thickness for optimal SHG. This establishes a foundation for controlled tellurene thickness, further broadening its potential in diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {The band alignment (BA) between two materials is a fundamental property that governs the functionality and performance of electronic and electrochemical devices. However, despite decades of study, the inability to separate surface properties from those of the bulk has made a deep understanding of the physics of BAs elusive. Building on the theory of the ideal vacuum level to separate surface from bulk [Choe et al. , Phys. Rev. B 103 , 235202 (2021)], here we present a geometric theory for the band alignment, specifically explaining the insensitivity of the alignment to interfacial orientation between isotropic materials. First, we adopt a neutral polyhedron, termed Wigner-Seitz atoms (WSA), to partition the charge of atoms in a way that maintains crystal symmetry and tessellates the space. In contrast to the CWZ theory, the band alignment of two materials constructed from such WSAs is independent of interface orientation. Upon electron relaxation at the interface, we show that the interfacial charge transfer dipole can be accurately described by the sum of localized point dipoles that exist between atoms at the interface (bond dipoles). For interfaces between isotropic materials, the magnitude of the bond dipole can be factored out as a multiplier, leaving only geometric factors, such as crystal symmetry and dimension of the material, to determine band alignment, regardless of the orientation of the interface. We considered 29 distinct interfaces and found that this bond dipole theory yields excellent agreement (RMS deviation &lt; 30 meV) with first-principles results. Our theory can be easily applied to interface between alloys, as well as between anisotropic systems.},

While most previous works have focused on isotropic BMR, arising from isotropic band structure or the spin Hall effect, we report on a strongly anisotropic BMR (ABMR) observed at the KTaO 3 Rashba interface, characterized by a unique low-symmetry Fermi surface. For the first time, we have successfully achieved significant regulation of ABMR through the application of gate voltage. Our quantified analysis reveals a profound link between the tunable anisotropy in Rashba spin splitting and the precise modulation of the Fermi level filling, highlighting its central role in governing gate-modulated ABMR. Additionally, we introduce a rigorous physical model that provides a deep and nuanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying gate-voltage-controlled ABMR.

  abstract     = {Bi 1− x Sb x alloys are classic thermoelectric materials for near-cryogenic applications. Despite more than half a century of study, unraveling the underlying transport physics within this space has been nontrivial due to the complex electronic structure, disorder, and small bandgap within these alloys. Furthermore, as Peltier coolers, Bi 1− x Sb x alloys operate in a bipolar regime; as such, understanding the impact of minority carriers is critical for further improvements in device performance. This study unites first principles calculations with low-temperature experimental measurements to create a generalized model for transport within semiconducting Bi-Sb alloys. Our exploration reveals the interplay between the complex, degenerate valence band structure with the extremely light conduction bands. By building a hybrid computational/experimental model, an understanding of both the electron and hole relaxation times emerges both as a function of temperature and energy. Special quasi-random supercell calculations reveal that, despite significant atomic disorder, the electronic band structures within the alloy remains largely unaffected and electron–phonon scattering dominates. For charge carriers near the band edges, the relaxation times are thus extremely long, consistent with cyclotronic behavior appearing at low magnetic fields ( ⁠ ≪ 1 T). Modeling thermoelectric performance suggests that the valence band edge deformation potential is significantly weaker and highlights the potential for p -type compositions to meet or exceed the current n -type alloys.},

  abstract     = {As a wide bandgap semiconductor, diamond holds both excellent electrical and thermal properties, making it highly promising in the electrical industry. However, its hole mobility is relatively low and dramatically decreases with increasing temperature, which severely limits further applications. Herein, we proposed that the hole mobility can be efficiently enhanced via slight compressive shear strain along the [100] direction, while the improvement via shear strain along the [111] direction is marginal. This impressive distinction is attributed to the deformation potential and the elastic compliance matrix. The shear strain breaks the symmetry of the crystalline structure and lifts the band degeneracy near the valence band edge, resulting in a significant suppression of interband electron–phonon scattering. Moreover, the hole mobility becomes less temperature-dependent due to the decrease of electron scatterings from high-frequency acoustic phonons. Remarkably, the in-plane hole mobility of diamond is increased by ∼ 800 % at 800 K with a 2% compressive shear strain along the [100] direction. The efficient shear strain strategy can be further extended to other semiconductors with face-centered cubic geometry.},

This study focuses on three-terminal synaptic transistors utilizing graphene and P(VDF-TrFE) to achieve dynamic reconfigurability between excitatory and inhibitory response modes, which are crucial for mimicking biological functions. The devices operate by applying different top gate spikes (±25 V and ±10 V) to modulate the polarization degree of P(VDF-TrFE), thereby regulating the carrier type and concentration in the graphene channel.

Although these applications are dependent on the optical performance, the origin of the optical absorption in electrochromic oxides is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that the electrochromism of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides can be described by a combination of polaron and bipolaron hopping. Based on the valences of the metallic constituents, we model experimental optical absorption spectra by polaron theory and assign two prominent absorption peaks to polaronic and bipolaronic charge transfer excitations. However, in the special case of V 2 O 5 , three peaks were necessary to fit the optical spectra. The activation energies of polaronic and bipolaronic hopping were remarkably similar for all the cathodic oxides studied. Within the framework of polaron absorption, V 2 O 5 would be categorized as a cathodic oxide, rather than as a mixed anodic/cathodic material as in the conventional picture.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional materials with multiple degrees of freedom, including spin, valleys, and orbitals, open up an exciting avenue for engineering multifunctional devices. Beyond spintronics, these degrees of freedom can lead to novel quantum effects such as valley-dependent Hall effects and orbital magnetism, which could revolutionize next-generation electronics. However, achieving independent control over valley polarization and orbital magnetism has been a challenge due to the need for large electric fields. A recent breakthrough involving pentalayer rhombohedral graphene has demonstrated the ability to individually manipulate anomalous Hall signals and orbital magnetic hysteresis, forming what is known as a valley-magnetic quartet. Here, we leverage the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity of pentalayer rhombohedral graphene to develop nonvolatile memory and in-memory computation applications. We propose an architecture for a dense, scalable, and selector-less nonvolatile memory array that harnesses the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity. In our designed array architecture, nondestructive read and write operations are conducted by sensing the valley state through two different pairs of terminals, allowing for independent optimization of read/write peripheral circuits. The power consumption of our PRG-based array is remarkably low, with only ∼6 nW required per write operation and ∼2.3 nW per read operation per cell. This consumption is orders of magnitude lower than that of the majority of state-of-the-art cryogenic memories. Additionally, we engineer in-memory computation by implementing majority logic operations within our proposed nonvolatile memory array without modifying the peripheral circuitry. Our framework presents a promising pathway toward achieving ultra-dense cryogenic memory and in-memory computation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Micro- and nano-electromechanical systems resonators have been regarded as powerful tools for precision mass detection, and their abilities to measure these in a liquid environment open various opportunities for biosensing, chemical analysis, and environmental monitoring. Apart from overcoming issues of fluidic damping and electrical interfaces, there is a great challenge of bringing microanalytes to these devices with the required precision and scaling for high throughput sensing. Herein, we address the above challenges by proposing a self-excited localized acoustic manipulation methodology based on a piezoelectric micromechanical diaphragm resonator (PMDR). Such a PMDR integrates acoustofluidics and mass sensing functions in tandem on a single device. Particle enrichment is realized within tens of seconds and the limit of detection is enhanced by mitigating common issues such as low capture rate and non-uniform distribution. The developed PMDR is versatile in its applicability to a range of particle sizes and densities for both acoustofluidic actuation and in situ mass sensing. This work addresses long-term technical challenges of inaccurate and inefficient measurement of liquid phase resonance mass sensing with great application potentials in biochemical detection and environmental monitoring.},

We review the design of acoustic metamaterials and the physical mechanisms underpinning their performance and related manufacturing methodologies, while also examining potential issues and challenges affecting the use of metamaterials in acoustics. The complexities of several metamaterial architectures are discussed. A new classification system is proposed to distinguish metamaterial configurations based on the typology of the channels inside the acoustic meta-atom. Several types of acoustic metamaterials architectures, such as perforated and micro-perforated panels, acoustic foams, resonators, various geometrical paths, and piezoelectric patches, are also discussed. The fundamental acoustic mechanisms of these classes of metamaterials are identified and commented on. The paper also describes the main measurement techniques used for acoustic metamaterials and the physical quantities evaluated, providing a guide to characterize and assess their performance. The fundamental challenges of the current metamaterials designs are discussed, with a focus on the complex synergy between architectural patterns of acoustic metamaterials and their thickness. We clarify the distinction between acoustic and elastic metamaterials, emphasizing the design and applications of materials that manipulate sound waves in fluid media.

  abstract     = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been studied intensively, and their practical applications are advancing. The efficiency of light-emitting materials has been improved significantly through the understanding of their emission mechanisms. However, the correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the operating voltage in OLEDs remains unclear, because OLEDs require a complex multilayer configuration that includes many materials other than the emitter. It is difficult to investigate the exact energy diagram for OLEDs, which have many interfaces, and many uncertainties remain regarding the mechanisms of charge injection and recombination. In this review, we introduce both the charge injection and recombination mechanisms in OLEDs and the interface control technology effective for lowering their operating voltage. We explain the electron injection mechanism at organic/cathode interfaces, which is clarified by using organic bases as the electron injection layers. The hole injection mechanism in OLEDs, which is clarified by investigating the correlation between the characteristics of OLEDs and the actual energy levels at organic/anode interfaces, is also introduced. With the elucidation of the charge injection mechanism, holes and electrons can now be injected into various organic materials. These charge injection techniques minimize the voltage required for charge recombination. The correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the minimum voltage required for OLED operation is clarified by controlling the energy levels at organic/organic interfaces. Understanding this correlation enables the design of molecules for ultralow-voltage OLEDs, thereby realizing blue OLEDs with an extremely low turn-on voltage of about 1.5 V.},

Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light–matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations—such as electrons, excitons, and photons—in low-dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Smart biomaterials have significantly impacted human healthcare by advancing the development of medical devices designed to function within human tissue, mimicking the behavior of natural tissues. While the intelligence of biomaterials has evolved from inert to active over the past few decades, smart biomaterials take this a step further by making their surfaces or bulk respond based on interactions with surrounding tissues, imparting outcomes similar to natural tissue functions. This interaction with the surrounding tissue helps in creating stimuli-responsive biomaterials, which can be useful in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, autonomous drug delivery, orthopedics, and much more. Traditionally, material engineering focused on refining the static properties of biomaterials to accommodate them within the body without evoking an immune response, which was a major obstacle to their unrestricted operation. This review highlights and explains various engineering approaches currently under research for developing stimuli-responsive biomaterials that tune their outcomes based on responses to bodily factors like temperature, pH, and ion concentration or external factors like magnetism, light, and conductivity. Applications in soft and hard tissue engineering, 4D printing, and scaffold design are also discussed. The advanced application of microfluidics, like organ-on-a-chip models, extensively benefits from the intrinsic smart properties of biomaterials, which are also discussed below. The review further elaborates on how smart biomaterial engineering could revolutionize biosensor applications, thereby improving patient care quality. We delineate the limitations and key challenges associated with biomaterials, providing insights into the path forward and outlining future directions for developing next-generation biomaterials that will facilitate clinical translation.},

The process from shape printing of microvasculature to function formation involves dynamic shift of bioink mechanical properties, mechanical microenvironments, and mechanobiology of endothelial and supporting cells. This review explores how biomechanical and mechanobiological principles are integrated into the bioprinting process to develop functional microvascular networks. Before printing, a top-level design approach based on these principles focuses on the interactions among biomaterials, cell behaviors, and mechanical environments to guide microvascular network fabrication. During printing, biomechanical design of bioinks for different bioprinting techniques, along with optimized biomechanical factors of bioprinting process, ensures accurate microvascular structure reproduction while maintaining cell viability. After printing, the emphasis is on creating a suitable mechanical environment to modulate the mechanobiology of multiple steps of neovascularization, including initiation, morphogenesis, lumen formation, stabilization, and maturation of functional microvasculature.

  abstract     = {The advent of artificial intelligence—deep neural networks (DNNs) in particular—has transformed traditional research methods across many disciplines. DNNs are data driven systems that use large quantities of data to learn patterns that are fundamental to a process. In the realm of artificial electromagnetic materials (AEMs), a common goal is to discover the connection between the AEM&#39;s geometry and material properties to predict the resulting scattered electromagnetic fields. To achieve this goal, DNNs usually utilize computational electromagnetic simulations to act as ground truth data for the training process, and numerous successful results have been shown. Although DNNs have many demonstrated successes, they are limited by their requirement for large quantities of data and their lack of interpretability. The latter results because DNNs are black-box models, and therefore, it is unknown how or why they work. A promising approach which may help to mitigate the aforementioned limitations is to use physics to guide the development and operation of DNNs. Indeed, this physics-informed learning (PHIL) approach has seen rapid development in the last few years with some success in addressing limitations of conventional DNNs. We overview the field of PHIL and discuss the benefits of incorporating knowledge into the deep learning process and introduce a taxonomy that enables us to categorize various types of approaches. We also summarize deep learning principles which are critical to PHIL understanding and the Appendix covers some of the physics of AEMs. A few specific PHIL works are highlighted and serve as examples of various approaches. Finally, we provide an outlook detailing where the field is currently and what we can expect in the future.},

Moreover, it provides opportunities to fine-tune interfaces and material compositions at the microscale, opening new avenues for next-generation energy storage and conversion devices. As MMAM is still in its early stages, a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between material chemistry, processing methods, and device design is fundamental to fully realize its potential for developing high-performance energy materials.

  abstract     = {While the development of new solid electrolytes (SEs) is crucial for advancing energy storage technologies, revisiting existing materials with significantly improved knowledge of their physical properties and synthesis control offers significant opportunities for breakthroughs. Na 1+ x Zr 2 Si x P 3− x O 12 (NaSICON) SEs have recently regained attention for applications in both solid-state and aqueous redox flow batteries due to their improved electrochemical and mechanical properties, along with their inherent electrochemical stability, air robustness, and low manufacturing cost. Recent improvements in NaSICON have primarily targeted macroscopic property enhancements and synthesis techniques. To enable further breakthroughs in the performance of NaSICON SEs, future efforts should focus on understanding how modified synthesis conditions influence atomic and microscopic-scale features, such as conduction channels, electronic structures, phase distributions, and grain boundaries. These features ultimately control ion conductivity, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability of NaSICON and its interfaces. Here, we review the current understanding of the structure-chemistry-property relationships of NaSICON SEs, focusing on atomic and microscopic levels. First, we introduce the proposed ionic conduction mechanisms in NaSICON crystallites. Then, we explore experimental investigations at phase and grain boundaries to assess ionic conduction and interfacial stability. We also examine strategies to address interfacial challenges such as high resistance and chemical reactions between SEs and electrodes, highlighting the difficulties in analyzing interfaces at the nano/atomic scale. Finally, we provide an outlook on advancing microscopy and spectroscopy techniques to enhance insights into NaSICON SEs ionic conduction and interfacial stability, supporting the development of improved long-duration energy storage devices.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear energy emerges as a promising and environmentally friendly solution to counter the escalating levels of greenhouse gases resulting from excessive fossil fuel usage. Essential to harnessing this energy are nuclear batteries, devices designed to generate electric power by capturing the energy emitted during nuclear decay, including α or β particles and γ radiation. The allure of nuclear batteries lies in their potential for extended lifespan, high energy density, and adaptability in harsh environments where refueling or battery replacement may not be feasible. In this review, we narrow our focus to nuclear batteries utilizing non-thermal converters such as α- or β-voltaics, as well as those employing scintillation intermediates. Recent advancements in state-of-the-art direct radiation detectors and scintillators based on metal perovskite halides (MPHs) and chalcogenides (MCs) are compared to traditional detectors based on silicon and III-V materials, and scintillators based on inorganic lanthanide crystals. Notable achievements in MPH and MC detectors and scintillators, such as nano-Gy sensitivity, 100 photons/keV light yield, and radiation hardness, are highlighted. Additionally, limitations including energy conversion efficiency, power density, and shelf-life due to radiation damage in detectors and scintillators are discussed. Leveraging novel MPH and MC materials has the potential to propel nuclear batteries from their current size and power limitations to miniaturization, heightened efficiency, and increased power density. Furthermore, exploring niche applications for nuclear batteries beyond wireless sensors, low-power electronics, oil well monitoring, and medical fields presents enticing opportunities for future research and development.},

Thus, engineering magnetic order in materials such as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism holds great scientific and technological interest. Defects such as vacancies, interstitials, and dopants induce local perturbations within the crystal lattice. These perturbations locally disturb the entire symmetry of crystals, resulting in symmetry breaking. Oxides, in particular, exhibit intriguing properties when subjected to defects, which can lead to significant modifications in their structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Such defects in non-magnetic oxides can induce magnetic symmetry breaking, leading to the formation of emergent magnetic domains and orderings. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in magnetic breaking symmetries in materials via defect engineering and present our perspectives on how these may lead to new understanding and applications.},

Diamond, Ga 2 O 3 , GaN, and SiC are typical WBS materials. Reliability studies for these four materials and devices are crucial for WBS applications. Traditional means of reliability studies include, but are not limited to, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopy et al. However, most of these methods are ex situ studies after material or device failure and thus have some limitations. In situ transmission electron microscope (TEM) is a favorable technology to observe the degradation and failure process of materials and devices in real time, which may provide effective guidance in material growth, device structure design, device process optimization, and reliability improvement. In recent years, in situ TEM technology has been gradually used by researchers to study WBS materials and devices. In this review, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of in situ TEM works on diamond, Ga 2 O 3 , GaN, and SiC materials and devices, with a particular focus on the progress of the technology in the reliability study of such materials and devices.

As a result, a wide variety of PDs on planar substrates have been reported using various light sensitive materials and traditional micro-/nano-fabrication technologies. In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing PDs with flexible form factors and using eco-friendly materials and approaches. These efforts have resulted in exploration of degradable materials and printed electronics as a resource-efficient route for manufacturing and to contain end-of-life issues. This paper reviews such new advances, particularly focusing on flexible PDs based on inorganic (e.g., crystalline silicon, compound semiconductors, metal oxides, etc.) semiconductor nanostructures [e.g., Nanowires (NWs), Nanoribbons (NRs), etc.]. The advantages and disadvantages of various bottom-up and top-down methods explored to realize the nanostructures and the wet (solution-processable) and dry printing and assembly methods to print the nanostructures on flexible substrates, are discussed along with their suitability for various applications. This discussion is supported by a comparative analysis of printed PDs in terms of key performance metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, I Light /I Dark ratio, response speed, and external quantum efficiency. This comprehensive discussion is expected to benefit researchers and practitioners from academia and industry interested in the field of printed and flexible PDs.},

Thus, understanding lattice dynamics is crucial for regulating thermal conduction, as the intrinsic limit mainly depends on phonon dispersions. Conventionally, thermal conduction is regulated through heat-carrying acoustic phonon manipulation due to their high group velocities, which are widely utilized in materials such as thermal coatings and thermoelectrics. In recent years, with advancements in thermal transport, optical phonons have been of great interest for tuning thermal conduction, with a particular focus on those with special dispersive behaviors; however, the microscopic mechanisms are significantly different. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effect of optical phonons, especially those with high weights on thermal conduction in advanced materials, as well as discuss the fundamental mechanisms, including (i) phonon bandwidth, (ii) phonon gap, (iii) avoided-crossing, (iv) phonon nesting/twinning, (v) optical-acoustic phonon bunching, and (vi) multiple optical phonons.},

  abstract     = {Quantum states of light, such as fixed photon number (Fock) states, entangled states, and squeezed states, offer important advantages with respect to classical states of light, such as coherent states and thermal states, in different areas: they enable secure communication and distribution of encryption keys, enable realization of sensors with higher sensitivity and resolution, and are considered candidates for quantum computing and simulation applications. To accommodate these applications, suitable methods for generating the quantum states are needed. Today, the quantum states are often produced by a spontaneous nonlinear process in a standard nonlinear material, followed by a series of optical elements necessary for encoding the desired state on the generated photons. In this review, we consider an alternative approach of structuring the nonlinearity of the crystal so that the desired quantum state will be generated directly at the crystal, without the need for additional elements. Our main focus here is on bulk crystals having structured second-order nonlinearity. The rising interest in these nonlinear metamaterials is fueled by advancements in the ability to efficiently simulate and design spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) processes, as well as by new capabilities of structuring the nonlinearity of ferroelectric crystals, either by electric field poling or by laser-induced writing. As a result, nonlinear metamaterials were recently used to directly shape the spatial and spectral correlations of quantum light that is generated in SPDC. The paper covers the theoretical background and the design and fabrication methods of bulk nonlinear metamaterials for generating quantum light, as well as a series of demonstrations of the use of metamaterials in quantum optical applications.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical reactions are pivotal for energy conversion and storage to achieve a carbon-neutral and sustainable society, and optimal electrocatalysts are essential for their industrial applications. Theoretical modeling methodologies, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), efficiently assess electrochemical reaction mechanisms and electrocatalyst performance at atomic and molecular levels. However, its intrinsic algorithm limitations and high computational costs for large-scale systems generate gaps between experimental observations and calculation simulation, restricting the accuracy and efficiency of electrocatalyst design. Combining machine learning (ML) is a promising strategy to accelerate the development of electrocatalysts. The ML-DFT frameworks establish accurate property–structure–performance relations to predict and verify novel electrocatalysts&#39; properties and performance, providing a deep understanding of reaction mechanisms. The ML-based methods also accelerate the solution of MD and DFT. Moreover, integrating ML and experiment characterization techniques represents a cutting-edge approach to providing insights into the structural, electronic, and chemical changes under working conditions. This review will summarize the DFT development and the current ML application status for electrocatalyst design in various electrochemical energy conversions. The underlying physical fundaments, application advancements, and challenges will be summarized. Finally, future research directions and prospects will be proposed to guide novel electrocatalyst design for the sustainable energy revolution.},

So, to realize these devices, an extensive study, from fundamental physics to practical applications, becomes essential. In this article, we present an exhaustive review of the advancements in understanding the fundamental physics behind magnetic skyrmions and the novel data storage and computing technologies based on them. We begin with an in-depth discussion of fundamental concepts such as topological protection, stability, statics, and dynamics essential for understanding skyrmions, henceforth the foundation of skyrmion technologies. For the realization of CMOS-compatible skyrmion functional devices, the writing and reading of the skyrmions are crucial. We discuss the developments in different writing schemes such as STT, SOT, and VCMA. The reading of skyrmions is predominantly achieved via two mechanisms: the magnetoresistive tunnel junction TMR effect and topological resistivity. So, a thorough investigation into the skyrmion Hall effect, topological properties, and emergent fields is also provided, concluding the discussion on skyrmion reading developments. Based on the writing and reading schemes, we discuss the applications of the skyrmions in conventional logic, unconventional logic, memory applications, and neuromorphic computing, including a model of a skyrmion-based SNN architecture achieving over 90% accuracy on MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets. Furthermore, we outline the potential of skyrmion-hosting Majorana zero modes in emerging topological quantum computation and helicity-dependent skyrmion qubits.},

  abstract     = {Solar fuel production through water splitting and CO 2 reduction by employing photocatalytic materials is a paradigm track to present renewable energy sources and lessen global warming. Among these materials, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been widely investigated in CO 2 reduction and water splitting to produce chemical fuels. However, pure LDHs suffer from sluggish charge-carrier transport, a great electron–hole recombination rate as well as tend to cause agglomeration. Due to the aforementioned bottlenecks, numerous modification techniques have been considerably explored to enhance the potential of LDHs toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 photoreduction. Therefore, this article presents a thorough review of developments made for the construction and modification of LDH photocatalyst properties aiming to enhance water splitting and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The review starts with the techniques adopted to synthesize LDH-based structures toward enhanced structure and morphology. The key semiconducting, optical, and electronic properties are studied to understand the conduct of LDH materials toward excellent photocatalytic material. The study then deliberates the techniques such as morphological engineering, hybridization with conducting and semiconducting materials, vacancy creation and defect engineering, components tuning, photothermal catalysis, heterojunction, and heterostructural engineering employed for the enrichment of photocatalytic properties. The study also discusses the steps taken to enhance the adsorption of LDHs and coupling of computational and operando techniques toward semiconducting, structural, and optical properties to investigate the best-performing photocatalysts. The study also reviews the recent advancements of LDH for applications toward water splitting and CO 2 conversion.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising cancer biomarkers due to their encapsulation of molecular signals reflective of originating tumor cells. Conventional analytical methods often fall short in comprehensive EV molecular profiling, necessitating innovative approaches for enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. This review focuses on the utilization of nanoplasmonic structures for optical signal detection of EVs, exploring advancements, challenges, and future prospects toward single EV molecular profiling. Nanoplasmonic structures offer enhanced optical readout capabilities, leveraging light iridescence, and plasmonic amplification suitable for the size range and complexity of the EVs. We delve into the research and implications of on-chip methods, shedding light on EVs&#39; role in health and disease. Despite notable progress, opportunities still exist to further develop nanoplasmonic arrays, customizing them for bioanalytes of interest, crucial for both label-free and labeled techniques to attain the objectives of their EV profiling. One such example is the use of specific antibodies for surface functionalization in nanoplasmonic arrays. Other approaches involve tailoring the design of platforms to the physical properties of target EVs, thereby enhancing characterization capabilities. The subsequent sections will cover a curated selection of relevant studies. We later discuss EV analysis through plasmonic nanoarrays in clinical sample scenarios. While patterning methods, such as colloidal self-assembly and e-beam lithography, enable integration with microfluidic systems, facilitating future investigations, few technologies have entered clinical trials. This roadblock highlights the need for further development of cost-effective, detailed molecular profiling methods. Moreover, we discuss avenues like single EV profiling and machine learning to address challenges related to heterogeneity of EVs as liquid biopsy biomarkers. Finally, we discuss future opportunities in developing nanoplasmonic-assisted EV profiling and studied their driving advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic realms, such as customizable nanoplasmonic structures coupled with artificial intelligence analysis modules, as a path forward for precise EV molecular profiling, which may enable personalized therapeutic interventions.},

Lower olefins (C 2–4 = ) are widely used as fundamental components in everyday products such as detergents, lubricants, plastic, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetic additives. Additionally, higher alcohols with functional C– groups can not only improve the atomic utilization in catalytic reactions but also serve as raw materials for combustibles, fuels or fuel additives, and various fine chemicals.

This paper systematically reviews the research progress of non-noble metal cobalt carbide Co x C ( x = 2, 3) catalysts for the efficient utilization of CO x ( x = 1, 2). The review covers the phase transitions during the formation of Co x C-based catalysts, their properties, activity, product selectivity, and interrelationships among these factors.

  abstract     = {Magnetoelectric (ME) composites exhibit robust ME interfacial coupling because of the strong interaction between piezoelectricity and magnetostriction. The presence of two novel functionalities, i.e., direct and converse ME couplings, makes them ideal candidates for multifunctional devices such as energy harvesters, magnetic field sensors, ME random access memories, and ME antennas. In these ME composites, ME coupling is strongly dependent on the superior physical properties of the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials. Therefore, magnetostrictive materials with excellent piezomagnetic coefficients and piezoelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric coefficients are required to achieve a large ME coupling. Among the various piezoelectric materials, ferroelectric relaxor-PbTiO 3 (PT) single crystals have been used extensively as piezoelectric constituents because of their ultrahigh piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Furthermore, the domain structure and crystal orientation of the relaxor-PT single crystals exhibit extraordinarily large piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Owing to these multifunctional properties, relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites have been widely used for studying direct and converse ME couplings in ME composites in recent years. Relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites show excellent ME coupling, e.g., the highest ME voltage coefficient, equivalent magnetic noise, and output power of 7000 V cm − 1 Oe − 1 @ 23.23 kHz, 6 pT/√Hz @1 Hz, and 19 mW @ 60 Hz, respectively, which are one of the best-reported values in ME composites so far.

An example of such applications in the energy sector is thermal energy storage using phase change materials. In such systems, and indeed in many other thermal systems, an emerging and promising approach involves the use of nanoparticles, which have been extensively studied for their potential to enhance the performance of thermal systems. However, conducting thermodynamic analyses of thermal systems in the presence of nanoparticles proves to be complex and resource-consuming because of the involvement of many parameters, including (i) temperature, molecular structure, and composition of the host fluid in which nanoparticles are either dispersed or in physical contact; (ii) nanoparticle morphology, size, type, and concentration; and (iii) complex interactions between the nanoparticles and the base fluid.

It begins with an overview of phase transition phenomena without nanoparticles, emphasizing the most important controlling parameters, and then examines the underlying physics of nanoparticle-involved phase transitions, critically examining their impact on process speed (transport rates).

On one side, the generalization of numerical results obtained by computational fluid dynamics would be important to deepen the comprehension of complex physical phenomena in droplet microfluidics, as well as the capability of predicting the device behavior.

  abstract     = {Electrokinetic energy harvesting (EKEH) has emerged as a promising renewable and carbon-neutral energy source for small and large-scale applications, reducing the reliance on conventional fossil fuels and providing innovative solutions for remote, off-grid applications. The underlying mechanism of EKEH relies on the movement of dissolved electrolytes over charged fluid–solid interfaces through confinements resulting in the generation of useful power. The low energy conversion efficiency typically observed in larger (micrometer) confinements can be substantially mitigated by shifting to nanometer and sub-nanometer regimes. This down-scaling unlocks high selectivity and provides unique opportunities to potentially harness Angstrom-scale interactions to maintain and elevate fluid permeability. However, EKEH at sub-nanometric scales remains fraught with considerable challenges in fabrication, economic viability, scaling of power, and maintenance, significantly impeding its advancement. In this review, we detail the electrokinetic processes that drive energy conversion in the presence of pressure, concentration, and temperature gradients. We examine the key factors affecting conversion efficiency and explore the innovative solutions in the recent literature addressing associated challenges. Additionally, we highlight the role of novel nanomaterials and specialized geometries along with new fabrication techniques that enable high permeation without sacrificing selectivity in nanometer and sub-nanometer confinements. Finally, we delve into the major obstacles that EKEH currently faces to reach its full potential of extracting clean and affordable energy and conclude by offering insight into future developmental directions and potential breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.},

  abstract     = {Nominally pure silica or amorphous SiO 2 is an important material in modern electronics, as well as other fields of science. Normally, it has been utilized for its insulation properties, for example, in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. However, it also can be considered as a wide bandgap semiconductor possessing very large electrical resistivity. The conductivity of various silica films has been studied since the mid-nineteenth century, usually assuming the presence of ionic conductivity. However, in the sense of a wide bandgap semiconductor, the temperature dependence of the resistivity, which ranges over more than four orders of magnitude, can be accurately explained by normal semiconductor behavior under the presumed presence of a deep electron trap/donor residing ∼2.3 eV below the conduction band edge. That is, the conductance is determined by electron motion and not by ions. Experiments have studied the transport of injected electrons (and holes) which are consistent with this viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {The omnipresence of polarized light on the surface of the earth, a result of atmospheric scattering, underscores the significance of detecting this light and extracting valuable information regarding the phase and polarization angle. In recent years, there has been a surge in research on polarization-sensitive photodetectors that utilize anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) materials. The essence of these 2D polarization-sensitive photodetectors is rooted in the anisotropic characteristics that arise from the asymmetric crystal lattice of the 2D materials in question. This anisotropy is manifested in both optical and electrical behaviors due to the asymmetrical nature of the crystal structure. This article systematically categorizes anisotropic 2D materials and offers an insightful overview of their crystal structures. It also introduces various optical and electrical characterization techniques designed to elucidate the anisotropic properties of these materials. The focus of the article then shifts to detailing the current state of research in the realm of anisotropic 2D material-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors. It provides a comprehensive description of the working principles behind polarization-sensitive photodetectors with different structural designs, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that enable their polarization sensitivity. In conclusion, the article summarizes the findings of this review, highlighting the advancements and challenges in the field. Additionally, this review proposes several forward-looking recommendations to guide the future trajectory of research and development in the domain of 2D material-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors.},
