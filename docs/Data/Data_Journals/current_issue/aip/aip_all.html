  abstract     = {This paper proposes a real-size, single-shot, high-speed, and energy-efficient tensorized optical multimodal fusion network (TOMFuN) on an electro-photonic large-scale III–V-on-Si in-memory compute engine. The TOMFuN architecture leverages a memory-efficient and low-complexity self-attention for the embedding network for the text information and tensor-train and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decompositions for compressing the model parameters in the large-scale fully connected layers. Compared to full-size counterparts, our proposed network maintains a compatible inference accuracy in multimodal sentiment analysis tasks while requiring 92.8× fewer model parameters and 51.3× fewer hardware resources. Furthermore, the impact of photonic device imperfections on the TOMFuN architecture is investigated. The simulation results show that noise-aware on-chip training exhibits superior robustness. Finally, chip performance analysis shows that our TOMFuN inference accelerator has 230.73 PetaOps computational speed, 6.51 TOPS/W power efficiency, and 2.7 µ s latency with the input dimensions of 1024.},

The spatial distribution of the crystalline phase of an HZO film reveals that the tetragonal phase is a dominant crystal structure in the HZO film with [Zr] = 75%, resulting in anti-ferroelectric (AFE)-like double polarization switching. Analyses using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) find that the AFE-HZO capacitor effectively transforms the 3-bit time-series input into eight different reservoir output states. In reservoir computing tasks, the AFE-HZO capacitor with [Zr] = 75% achieves improved computational capacities compared with the other MFM capacitors with [Zr] = 0% and 50%. The AFE-HZO capacitor can effectively diversify time-series input signals through dynamic double polarization switching, leading to a more sub-divided and dispersive weight distribution across the adjustable weights in the readout part of our RC system.},

These resistance changes can remain for very long times or relax after a short time. Thus, memristors can be used as electronic synapses and neurons in artificial neural networks implemented in hardware. These fully memristive neuromorphic circuits are mainly intended for artificial intelligence applications. In this work, we explore the properties of a stochastic compact model for the electrical behavior of memristors in the two regimes of long-time (non-volatile) and short-time (volatile) memory for synapse and neuron functions, respectively. In the case of non-volatile memristors, we focus on potentiation/depression transients, programming energy, programming time, and power requirements for writing conductance weights in artificial network crossbars. As for volatile memristors, we consider the modeling of their behavior in the context of a leaky-integrate-and-fire neuron, demonstrating how the model captures the threshold activation function and the input signal frequency dependence.},

However, a large body of natural phenomena incorporates memory effects that are best described via fractional integro-differential equations (FIDEs), in which the integral or differential operators accept non-integer orders. Addressing the challenges posed by nonlinear FIDEs is a recognized difficulty, necessitating the application of generic methods with immediate practical relevance. This work introduces the Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equations Solver (UniFIDES), a comprehensive machine learning platform designed to expeditiously solve a variety of FIDEs in both forward and inverse directions, without the need for ad hoc manipulation of the equations. The effectiveness of UniFIDES is demonstrated through a collection of integer-order and fractional problems in science and engineering. Our results highlight UniFIDES’ ability to accurately solve a wide spectrum of integro-differential equations and offer the prospect of using machine learning platforms universally for discovering and describing dynamic and complex systems.},

These limitations include increased leakage currents, pronounced short-channel effects, and quantum tunneling through the gate oxide, leading to higher power consumption and deviations from ideal behavior. Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) can overcome these challenges by utilizing the quantum tunneling of charge carriers to switch between on and off states and achieve a subthreshold swing below 60 mV/decade. This allows for lower power consumption, continued scaling, and improved performance in low-power applications. This review focuses on the design and operation of TFETs, emphasizing the optimization of device performance through material selection and advanced simulation techniques. The discussion will specifically address the use of two-dimensional materials in TFET design and explore simulation methods ranging from multi-scale approaches to machine learning-driven optimization.},

Machine learning has been actively explored as a means to this end; however, challenges remain in terms of versatility for different tasks and device types. In this study, we explore a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach: unlike traditional reinforcement learning techniques, the learning process of MBRL progresses by constructing a model for the environment, which is to be diverted for other tasks and/or devices, thereby minimizing time-consuming learning processes. Using pre-measured data, we construct an environment model and, despite the intrinsic sparse reward distribution of the QD system, demonstrate its suitability for MBRL by emulating the process of auto-tuning to a single QD region. Our results highlight the potential of MBRL for more generic QD auto-tuning techniques, providing a promising step toward fully automated QD tuning.},

  abstract     = {Identifying reaction coordinates (RCs) is a key to understanding the mechanism of reactions in complex systems. Deep neural network (DNN) and machine learning approaches have become a powerful tool to find the RC. On the other hand, the hyperparameters that determine the DNN model structure can be highly flexible and are often selected intuitively and in a non-trivial and tedious manner. Furthermore, how the hyperparameter choice affects the RC quality remains obscure. Here, we explore the hyperparameter space by developing the hyperparameter tuning approach for the DNN model for RC and investigate how the parameter set affects the RC quality. The DNN model is built to predict the committor along the RC from various collective variables by minimizing the cross-entropy function; the hyperparameters are automatically determined using the Bayesian optimization method. The approach is applied to study the isomerization of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and in water, and the features that characterize the RC are extracted using the explainable AI (XAI) tools. The results show that the DNN models with diverse structures can describe the RC with similar accuracy, and furthermore, the features analyzed by XAI are highly similar. This indicates that the hyperparameter space is multimodal. The electrostatic potential from the solvent to the hydrogen H 18 plays an important role in the RC in water. The current study shows that the structure of the DNN models can be rather flexible, while the suitably optimized models share the same features; therefore, a common mechanism from the RC can be extracted.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, data-driven deep learning models have gained significant importance in the analysis of turbulent dynamical systems. Within the context of reduced-order models, convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) pose a universally applicable alternative to conventional approaches. They can learn nonlinear transformations directly from data, without prior knowledge of the system. However, the features generated by such models lack interpretability. Thus, the resulting model is a black-box that effectively reduces the complexity of the system but does not provide insights into the meaning of the latent features. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel interpretable CAE approach for high-dimensional fluid flow data that maintains the reconstruction quality of conventional CAEs and allows for feature interpretation. Our method can be easily integrated into any existing CAE architecture with minor modifications of the training process. We compare our approach to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two existing methods for interpretable CAEs. We apply all methods to three different experimental turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection datasets with varying complexity. Our results show that the proposed method is lightweight, easy to train, and achieves relative reconstruction performance improvements of up to 6.4% over POD for 64 modes. The relative improvement increases to up to 229.8% as the number of modes decreases. In addition, our method delivers interpretable features similar to those of POD and is significantly less resource-intensive than existing CAE approaches, using less than 2% of the parameters. These approaches either trade interpretability for reconstruction performance or only provide interpretability to a limited extent.},

By incorporating the scattering physics of x rays into the network, SAXSNN could be trained to capture the complex mapping between the SAXS patterns in reciprocal space and the corresponding morphologies in real space in an unsupervised way. We demonstrated the performance of SAXSNN on the experimental SAXS patterns of semicrystalline and amorphous polymers, i.e., hard-elastic isotactic polypropylene (iPP) films and plasticized poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB). The morphologies reconstructed by SAXSNN are well consistent with our existing knowledge of the morphology of iPP films and PVB. The developed methodology here allows us to rapidly predict the morphologies for any given SAXS pattern without any in-prior phase information and, thus, provides an intuitive understanding of the microstructures of the measured samples. A real-time feedback of the morphologies of measured samples to SAXS beamline users at modern synchrotron radiation light sources will be feasible in the near future.},

  abstract     = {In materials informatics, feature selection and model selection are utilized in the knowledge extraction process, and the confidence evaluation of the selection result is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the extracted knowledge. In this study, we propose a novel method to quantitatively evaluate the significance of low-dimensional models obtained from an expanded feature space using the density of states (DoS) for the evaluation metrics. This method allows us to compare the performance of the selected model to those of other models and evaluate its significance. We further propose an evaluation method for feature importance based on marginal posterior probabilities using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) framework, which considers all models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through their application to a crystal structure dataset. Our results show that the DoS analysis reveals the presence of a large number of models with a comparable performance with the best model reported in a previous research work. This suggests that knowledge extracted from a single selected model can be unreliable and that considering other models is crucial. We also show that the BMA-based feature importance evaluation provides valuable insights into the importance of features, highlighting both primary features and functional forms. In addition, we demonstrate that the LASSO + L0 method commonly used in existing research deteriorates the search space for model selection. Our findings suggest that our proposed methods provide valuable tools for assessing the significance of low-dimensional models and extracting knowledge from large-scale data in materials informatics.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement—so-called entanglement engineering—for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon–phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.},

This model extends previous work on the U-net model. Here we trained binary-, three-, and five-class models using supervised learning on experimentally measured dynamic fracture experiments on various opaque structural ceramic materials that were adhered on transparent polymer (polycarbonate or acrylic) backing materials. Full details of the experimental investigations are outside the scope of this manuscript, but briefly, several different ceramics were loaded using spatially and time-varying mechanical loads to induce inelastic deformation and fracture processes that were recorded at frequencies as high as 5 MHz using high-speed optical imaging. These experiments provided a rich and diverse dataset that includes many of the common fracture modes found in static and dynamic fractures, including cone cracking, median cracking, comminution, and combined complex failure modes that involve effectively simultaneous activation and propagation of multiple fragmentation modes. While the training data presented here were obtained from dynamic fragmentation experiments, this study is applicable to static loading of these materials as the crack speeds are on the order of 1–10 km/s regardless of the loading rate. We believe the methodologies presented here will be useful in quantifying the failure processes in structural materials for protection applications and can be used for direct validation of engineering models used in design.},

RhoB, a key biomarker assessed via immunohistochemistry, is crucial in predicting responses to radiotherapy (RT), but variability in staining techniques and tumor heterogeneity often complicate these assessments. SRGNet integrates spatial statistics, nonlinear dynamics, graph theory, and graph convolutional networks to address these challenges. In testing, SRGNet outperformed 10 pre-trained convolutional neural networks, achieving 88% accuracy in biopsies from RT patients, with 67% accuracy for predicting survival under five years and 100% accuracy for survival over five years, along with 100% precision, an F1 score of 0.80, and an AUC of 0.73. For non-RT patients, SRGNet attained 91% accuracy, 100% precision for survival over five years, an F1 score of 0.86, and an AUC of 0.82. These results demonstrate SRGNet’s potential to enhance the precision and reliability of survival predictions in rectal cancer patients, overcoming challenges of RhoB expression variability and tumor heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional autoencoders have proven to be an adequate tool to perform reduced-order modeling for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. Their goal is to reduce dimensionality strongly while preserving the most characteristic features of the system. Here, we show that these models rely sensitively on the completeness of the provided data. This is particularly challenging for fully turbulent flows with their coherent structures ranging from large-scale superstructures to dissipative eddies over orders of magnitude in time and space. As a result, an unrealistically large number of data snapshots would be required to properly cover all the essential dynamics, whereas the features on small time and length scales require only a small number of snapshots of the respective flow, especially the long lasting large-scale structures that are difficult to characterize either numerically or experimentally. We demonstrate for three types of flows that a missing representation of large-scale turbulent structures leads to failures in the training process. We suggest a method to mitigate this shortcoming. This includes the transformation of data samples to new large-scale structures, which enhance the data. Furthermore, we skip augmentations that are more detrimental to the model performance. We evaluate our method for three datasets, two from numerical simulations of turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection flows and one from laboratory experiment for the flow past an array of cylinders. We show that the method can substantially improve model utility for high-dimensional data. In this way, we avoid an intensive grid search through possible augmentation combinations without further knowledge about the underlying system.},

  abstract     = {This research offers a new analytical tool that unravels the nonlinear relation between the parameters of Viscoelastic Damping (VD) and the resulting frequency spectrum in musical membranes. Understanding how variations in VD parameters influence the resulting sounds is crucial for developing new tools for artistic expression and for designing musical instruments with distinct sound qualities. In the case of membranophones, the external damping is well understood, while the internal damping due to viscoelastic properties of materials remains unclear. In previous research, VD in musical membranes has been modeled using a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) model. Nonetheless, analyzing the complex relationships between the large parameter space of the model and the nonlinear behavior of VD is a challenging task. This study addresses this analysis through physics-based machine learning. We employed a FDTD model of a viscoelastically damped membrane to create a physics-informed dataset, which we subsequently analyzed using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). Our findings reveal that the damping coefficient is the primary criterion when clustering the data. Furthermore, we found the internal structure of the cluster to depend on the rate of decay of the memory effect, i.e., the rate at which the energy introduced back into the system decreases. The study also demonstrates the benefits of using principal component analysis for the SOM initialization.},

A systematic survey of these and other algorithms in the nanophotonics context remains lacking. Here, we compare 24 widely used machine learning optimizers on inverse design tasks. We study two prototypical nanophotonics inverse design problems—the mode splitter and wavelength demultiplexer—across various system sizes, using both hand-tuned and meta-learned hyperparameters. We find that Adam derivatives, as well as the Fromage optimizer, consistently outperform L-BFGS and standard gradient descent, regardless of system size. While meta-learning has a negligible-to-negative impact on Adam and Fromage, it significantly improves others, particularly AdaGrad derivatives and simple gradient descent, such that their performance is on par with Adam. In addition, we observe that the most effective optimizers exhibit the lowest correlation between initial and final performance.

In this work, a synchrotron three-dimension reciprocal space mapping (3D-RSM) technique, which offers a larger Q -space range and higher spatial resolution, was developed and used to analyze YBCO films grown on (001)-oriented LAO, STO, and MgO substrates. The 3D-RSM results reveal that epitaxial YBCO c domains dominate the films, with minor YBCO a domains in YBCO/LAO. The YBCO c domains present a consistent epitaxial relationship with the substrate STO and LAO, with the domain boundary parallel to the substrate [110] or [ 1 ¯ 10] axes. In contrast, YBCO/MgO films exhibit two distinct in-plane epitaxy orientations. Quantitatively measured lattice constants indicate the possible T c -related oxygen vacancy condition therein. A 2-in. YBCO/MgO film, prepared by a homemade pulsed laser deposition system, verified the structural non-uniformity issues, suggesting room for further optimization.

The laser beatnote between two nearly identical systems, each using saturated absorption spectroscopy in a simple retroreflected configuration, exhibits an instability of 2.5 × 10 −13 at 1 s, consistent with phase noise analysis, and 3 × 10 −14 at 200 s. The primary contributors to the stability budget at 1 s are the FM-AM noise conversion and the intermodulation effect, both emerging from laser frequency noise. These results highlight the potential of microcell-based optical references to achieve stability performances comparable to that of an active hydrogen maser in a remarkably simple architecture.},

  abstract     = {Superconducting microwave resonators are critical to quantum computing and sensing technologies. Additionally, they are common proxies for superconducting qubits when determining the effects of performance-limiting loss mechanisms such as from two-level systems (TLSs). The extraction of these loss mechanisms is often performed by measuring the internal quality factor Q i as a function of power or temperature. In this work, we investigate large temporal fluctuations of Q i at low powers over periods of 12–16 h (relative standard deviation σ Q i / Q i = 13 % ⁠ ). These fluctuations are ubiquitous across multiple resonators, chips, and cooldowns. We are able to attribute these fluctuations to variations in the TLS loss tangent due to two main indicators. First, measured fluctuations decrease as power and temperature increase. Second, for interleaved measurements, we observe correlations between low- and medium-power Q i fluctuations and an absence of correlations with high-power fluctuations. Agreement with the TLS loss tangent mean is obtained by performing measurements over a time span of a few hours. We hypothesize that, in addition to decoherence, due to coupling to individual near-resonant TLS, superconducting qubits are affected by these observed TLS loss tangent fluctuations.},

In this study, we construct a two-dimensional (2D) multi-physics model and simulate the 2D geometry and internal electrochemical processes to investigate the multiscale effects of microstructures on overall battery performance. Concurrently, we design three distinct anode structures: porosity gradient distribution structures, hard carbon–graphite composite anodes, and hard carbon-coated graphite anodes to identify structural features that enhance key battery performance metrics. Additionally, we analyze the distribution of side-reaction products and the Li + concentration to reveal the influence of different microstructures on internal mass transport and electrochemical reactions. We also identify the factors within these three structures that contribute to extending battery lifespan and improving overall performance. This work systematically establishes the relationship between anode microstructures and battery performance, providing insights that are expected to optimize materials, reduce trial-and-error, and use simulations to guide experimental work more efficiently.},

A high carrier concentration is ascribed to the increase in the density of states after In doping proved by first-principles calculations and experiments, which leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity of ∼1686.84 S cm −1 and moderate S above ∼105.24 μ V K −1 . Consequently, a peak power factor of 18.68 μ W cm −1 K −2 was realized in In doped Sb 2 Te 3 thin films at 300 K, representing a ∼17% increase compared to the undoped samples. After 1000 bending cycles, the relative resistance evolution lower than 2% and relative S evolution lower than 5% exhibit excellent flexibility of In-doped flexible thermoelectric film.

The electrocatalytic behavior of reaction sites in water splitting is modeled by using the Butler–Volmer equation. The impacts of the ESC parameters, including the extraction energy level and the transmission energy width, on the performance of HCPC devices have been investigated. The results indicate that the thermal losses from non-ideal ESCs significantly limit HCPC efficiency, which can be enhanced by optimizing ESC parameters. Comparisons show that HCPCs with quantum dot ESCs outperform those with quantum well ESCs, owing to their superior carrier transport capability and lower thermal loss rates. For an absorber bandgap of 1 eV ⁠ , the optimized solar-to- H 2 energy conversion efficiencies of the two HCPCs reach 62.34 % and 64.93 % ⁠ , respectively, highlighting the promising application potential of these catalysts.},

Verified with resolution targets and a histological sample, our method achieved a resolution improvement of 2.5 times the diffraction limit of the objective lens and provided QPI over a large field-of-view.

This enhancement may be attributed to the strong charge transfer with biomolecules and anisotropic structure, which increases molecular dipole moments when positioned on its surface. These factors lead to stronger molecular interactions and improved Raman signal sensitivity.

However, their intrinsic properties of photoluminescence intensity and carrier lifetime, key to photodetector performance, are still limited with conventional approaches (e.g., material purification and defect passivation). Here, we propose an efficient ultrasound-assisted growth method to manipulate the crystal phase of all-inorganic perovskites. Morphological, structural, and elemental characteristics of perovskites are comprehensively investigated, confirming the formation of CsPb 2 Br 5 –CsPbBr 3 dual-phase (DP) perovskites. The fabricated DP perovskites exhibit enhanced carrier dynamics compared to CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs), including over a tenfold increase in photoluminescence intensity and an extended carrier lifetime of 656 ns. Such impressive improvements originate from the repeated radiative recombination introduced by the hierarchical phase of DP perovskites. As a result, the DP perovskite-based photodetector also demonstrates improved photoresponse, including a larger on/off ratio exceeding 10 3 and a higher detectivity of 1.48 × 10 10 Jones, especially in the absence of conventional transporting layers. These results offer strong competitiveness for state-of-the-art perovskite photodetectors and deliver important implications for the widespread use of DP perovskites in assembling high-performance optoelectronic devices.},

For instance, DFT/MC simulation indicates that ( Ti 0.5 Cr 0.5 ) 4 C 3 MXenes exhibit interlayer segregation, where Cr atoms are favorable to segregate into the outermost top and bottom layers, forming out-of-plane MXene ( o -MXenes). Such an o -MXene structure was also found in ( Nb 0.5 Mo 0.5 ) 4 C 3 ⁠ , ( Cr 0.5 Mo 0.5 ) 4 C 3 ⁠ , and ( Ti 0.33 Cr 0.33 Mo 0.34 ) 4 C 3 MXenes, which is in good agreement with prior studies. The classical molecular dynamics (MD)/MC simulations using machine learning interatomic potentials further validate the interlayer segregation-induced o -MXene observed in the DFT/MC simulations. This DFT/MC framework can be easily extended to predict the stable phases for other material systems, suggesting its broad applicability and impact.},

  abstract     = {Light–matter interactions are of fundamental scientific and technological interest. Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Larger signals can most directly be obtained by higher repetition rates, which, however, are typically limited to a few kilohertz by the thermal relaxation of thin material films. Here, we combine nanometric electron beam probing with sample support structures tailored to facilitate rapid specimen cooling. Optical cycling of a charge-density wave transformation enables quantifying the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the heat diffusion in different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to 200 μ W/ μ m 2 within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of 2 MHz. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.},

Beyond their intriguing electrical transport phenomena, such as the negative magnetoresistance driven by the chiral anomaly and the anomalous Hall effect, they also exhibit intriguing second-order optoelectronic responses, such as the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). In this Letter, we investigate the CPGE in a class of double Weyl semimetal protected by the C 3 z T symmetry by using the effective model. Unlike double Weyl semimetal protected by C n z (n = 4, 6) symmetry, when time-reversal symmetry T is broken, one C 3 z T -protected double Weyl point (WP) evolves into four single WPs, three of which are related by C 3 z symmetry, and these WPs share the same topological charge and reside at the same energy level. This unique configuration enhances the CPGE trace due to the combined topological charge of the three WPs, resulting in a higher quantized plateau. Our findings provide promising prospects for the development of optoelectronic devices in the future.},

In this work, Ca intercalated Germanene-CaGe 2 films were grown on sapphire substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that the partial lack of Ca between the germanene buckled layers effectively increases the Seebeck coefficient without restraining the conductivity. A maximum power factor of 170 μ W/mK 2 at 523 K, which is seven times larger than the stoichiometric CaGe 2 film, was achieved in the Ca 0.835 Ge 2 film by suppression of bipolar effect and formation of a Ca-deficient phase.

To enhance PL intensity, field enhancement techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of metal nanoparticles, are often employed. However, SPR-induced light confinement at the nanoscale also leads to significant localized heating. In this study, we investigated the impact of near-field heating due to SPR using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) and tip-enhanced photoluminescence studies. Our results reveal nearly an order-of-magnitude difference in the enhancement factors (EFs) for Raman and PL signals of monolayer MoS 2 , with a local temperature increase of approximately 147 °C under the TERS tip at a laser power of 10.57 mW. The reduced PL EF compared with Raman EF is attributed to additional near-field heating from SPR. We further observed that local temperature fluctuations critically affect the EFs and found that a high thermal conductivity substrate can effectively mitigate the near-field thermal effects associated with SPR.},

  abstract     = {The ultra-high piezoelectric activity of K 0.5 Na 0.5 NbO 3 (KNN)-based single crystals with excellent electromechanical coupling characteristics has attracted great interest. However, the growth of KNN-based single crystals is restricted by their high melting point and harsh equipment conditions. In this work, a large-sized single crystal of (K 0.5 Na 0.5 ) 0.994 Bi 0.006 Nb 0.998 Cu 0.004 O 3 (KNNBC) was grown using an inexpensive and simple seed-free solid state crystal growth method. The growth mechanism, domain structures, defects, piezoelectric properties, as well as the conduction mechanisms of the KNNBC single crystal were systematically investigated. A significant piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) as high as 392 pC/N is obtained in the KNNBC single crystal, which is three times higher than that of ceramics with the same composition, and the single crystal also maintains a high Curie temperature ( T c ∼ 399 °C). The superior piezoelectric properties are believed to stem from the ordered arrangement of large-sized striped domains (∼300 nm) and the sensitivity to polarization rotation due to the flattening of the Landau energy density. Additionally, the spontaneous polarization combined with complex defect dipoles consisting of Cu 2+ ions and O 2− vacancies effectively modulates both the quality factor ( Q m ) and the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) of the single crystals. This work broadens the growth strategy of high-performance KNN-based single crystals and highlights the great benefits of the synergistic modulation of defects and domains on the piezoelectric properties of single crystals.},

Our findings show that the electric polarization state of the Sc 2 CO 2 monolayer governs the electronic properties of heterostructures. Positive polarization induces a direct gap at the valleys, enabling valleytronic functionality for excitation and readout via circularly polarized light, while negative polarization results in an indirect-gap, suppressing valleytronic behavior. Moreover, our transport simulations further demonstrate a polarization-dependent ferroelectric p-i-n junction with 8 nm possesses a maximum tunnel electroresistance (TER) ratio of 1.60 × 10 8 % at a bias of 0.5 eV. These results provide insights into ferroelectric-controlled valleytronic transitions and position the HfCl 2 /Sc 2 CO 2 heterostructure as a promising candidate for energy-efficient valleytronic memory and nonvolatile storage applications.},

Therefore, we conduct the biased in situ transmission electron microscopy experiments on the electrical transport properties of BFO single crystals with single domains. The in situ measured I – V curves indicate neither one-way conduction nor resistance switching. The conductive behavior of BFO corresponds to space charge-limited conduction, indicating a high concentration of oxygen vacancies and the presence of Ohmic contact between the Pt electrode and BFO. After applying a DC constant voltage, the resistance decreases by approximately 50% and partially recovers after exposure to air. The electron energy loss spectroscopy spectra under different conditions indicate that BFO interacts with the external environment. Specifically, DC voltage causes BFO to release oxygen atoms, resulting in an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration and decrease in resistance. Air oxidation leads to a decrease in oxygen vacancy concentration and partial recovery of resistance. In addition, in situ heating experiments (at 20–400 °C) indicate that oxygen vacancies mainly originate from the external electric field rather than thermal effects.},

In this work, the atomic configuration, chemical composition, and magnetic properties of Fe 3 X 4 (X = S, Se, Te) nanowires were confirmed by first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. Due to their intrinsic anisotropic character and strong d-p hybridization, Fe 3 X 4 nanowires exhibit antiferromagnetic semiconducting behavior with good stability, a tunable bandgap of 0.277–0.771 eV, a large vertical magnetic anisotropy energy of 2.39 meV/Fe, and a high Néel temperature of 680–840 K. Moreover, the calculation of the spin transport properties has shown that these Fe 3 X 4 nanowires possess the negative differential resistance behavior with the peak-to-valley current ratio from 1.84 to 6.85.

However, reducing the thickness of the NiCo 2 O 4 film to a few atomic layers degrades its room temperature magnetic and electrical properties, limiting its practical application. In this study, a Co 3 O 4 buffer layer is introduced into ultrathin NiCo 2 O 4 films, which significantly enhances the Curie temperature beyond room temperature and reduces the resistivity, while preserving the strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as well as the robust anomalous Hall effect. It is found that the sheet resistance dramatically decreases with the increase in Co 3 O 4 thickness. The observed phenomena may originate from the increased occupation of Ni 3+ ions at octahedral sites due to the interfacial coupling, resulting in the intrinsic linear relationship between resistivity and Curie temperature. Additionally, the scaling relation between the anomalous Hall conductivity and longitudinal conductivity highlights the complex interaction between spin-dependent impurity scattering and the band intrinsic Berry curvature. This study indicates that interfacial coupling is an effective strategy for tuning the physical properties of oxides, providing a promising avenue for the application of NiCo 2 O 4 -based materials in miniaturized spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit torque (SOT) switching is a promising candidate mechanism to be applied in the spintronic devices. Here, we report the SOT switching in the [Co/Ni] × n multilayers with maze domain structures. The experimental results show that the SOT switching efficiency strongly depends on the magnetic structure of the ferromagnet (FM) layer. With the increase in cycle number of [Co/Ni] × n multilayers, the switching ratio rapidly decreases, even cannot present the magnetization switching. This switching behavior can be attributed to the strong domain wall pinning in the samples with the maze domain structure. Moreover, although the samples in this work have the same spin current sources, the estimated SOT efficiencies vary greatly, suggesting that the SOT efficiency in a FM/heavy metal (HM) structure depends not only on the spin Hall effect and/or Rashba effect but also on the magnetic structure of FM layer. This work provides a better understanding for the nature of SOT switching in the FM/HM heterostructures with maze domain.},

  abstract     = {During the grain boundary diffusion (GBD) of Tb, the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures are the two main microstructures influencing the magnetic properties of the sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets. These two microstructures are all composed of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B phase, but the formation mechanisms are different. The difference in formation mechanism of the core–shell and reverse core–shell structures was studied by quenching the magnets at different temperatures and holding times. The (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell of the core–shell structure is the precondition for forming the reverse core–shell structure. The triple-junction phases (TJPs) area change proves that the Nd elements diffuse from the TJPs to the surface of the (Nd, Tb) 2 Fe 14 B shell to form the Tb-poor shell in the reverse core–shell structure and the Gaussian distribution of Tb in the shell of the core–shell structure. In addition, the difference in the Tb content distribution leads to different demagnetization processes, resulting in the opposite effect of these two microstructures on the coercivity. The GBD aims to increase the entire coercivity by enhancing the surface anisotropy field ( H A ), such as the Tb-rich shell for the grains and the Tb-rich surface (∼200 μ m) for the magnets. Therefore, for the reverse core–shell structure forming in the surface of the magnets, the surface with a low H A decreases the coercivity of the grains, reducing the coercivity of the magnets.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials with high spin polarization and controllable magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) are critical for advancing spintronic technologies. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that monolayer Cr 2 Te 2 exhibits intrinsic dynamic/thermal stability, half-metallicity, and robust ferromagnetic ordering. The Curie temperature ( T c ) can be elevated from 90 to 190 K via external stimuli. Strain engineering, carrier doping, and electric-fields enable precise control of MAE, while tensile strain and electron doping enhance MAE to 2.680 meV. Conversely, compressive strain and hole doping induce a spin reorientation transition. Moreover, external electric fields also play a key role in determining MAE, suggesting a promising strategy for manipulating MAE in 2D ferromagnets. These modifications primarily arise from the alternations of the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) strength between Te-derived p -orbitals within specific spin channels. These findings establish Cr 2 Te 2 as a versatile platform for spintronics integrating half-metallicity with dynamically adjustable magnetic properties and motivate further experimental exploration.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the orbital torque generated in ferromagnetic (FM)/manganese (Mn) bilayer systems based on angular-dependent spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) experiments. From the ST-FMR results, it is found that a relatively large out-of-plane anti-damping torque can be obtained in Ni/Mn bilayers. The Gilbert damping constant, derived from the resonant linewidth of frequency-dependent ST-FMR experiments, decreases almost linearly with increasing thickness of Mn, further indicating the out-of-plane anti-damping torque in Ni/Mn bilayer systems. The origin of this torque can be attributed to the orbital Rashba–Edelstein effect. Furthermore, the orbital diffusion length ( ⁠ λ L ⁠ ) in Mn is determined to be more than 17 nm and larger than spin diffusion length, suggesting that the torque observed in our sample is predominantly influenced by the orbital-related effect. Finally, the insertion of Pt in a Ni/Mn bilayer system significantly enhances the orbital-to-spin conversion efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that Mn is a promising material for future orbitronics devices.},

  abstract     = {Understanding thermal transport behaviors across dissimilar metal films is essential for optimizing electronic devices&#39; performance and efficiency. However, the effect of interfacial parameters such as the thickness on interfacial thermal conductance ( G ) of metal/metal remains elusive. In this Letter, the G between Al and Cu with varying Cu thickness was investigated from 78 to 295 K using the time domain thermoreflectance technique combined with nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and the diffuse mismatch model (DMM). The temperature dependence of G Al/Cu follows a pattern that is consistent with phonon-related thermal transport behaviors and decreases with increasing Cu thickness. The phonon related behaviors are attributed to the existence of the oxide layer at the interface. By taking the oxide layer into account, NEMD and DMM calculations match well with the experimental results, proving that the oxide layer hinders electron transport across the interface. We further find that strain distributions in Cu layers have a negative correlation with Cu thickness. When applying compressive strain on Cu, the overlap of phonon density of states between Cu and Al increases, especially for phonons of 6.5–9 THz, which is responsible for the Cu thickness-dependence in G Al/Cu . Our results not only help revealing strain effect on G but also pave the way for the thermal design of metal interconnect in integrated circuits.},

  abstract     = {Integrating high thermal conductivity cost-effective SiC to the Si-active-layer film is an effective solution to enhance the thermal performance of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and maintain its distinct electrical performance. Although direct bonding of Si films to SiC substrates demonstrates many advantages over epitaxial growth, different bonding techniques may yield disparate bonding qualities and heat dissipation abilities. Here, a comparative analysis from thermal-mechanical-structural perspectives of different Si/SiC interfaces, prepared by hydrophilic bonding (HB) and surface-activated bonding (SAB) methods, is systematically conducted. It was found that the amorphous interlayer thickness and thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of the SAB-Si/SiC heterojunction can be significantly modulated by annealing, accompanied by a beneficial decreased TBR at high working temperatures. Moreover, the residual stress within the Si film by SAB is greatly reduced to an order of magnitude lower than that by HB. In general, the SAB-Si/SiC interface exhibits a tunable microstructure, comparably low TBR, and nearly fully relaxed stress, potentially outperforming the HB-Si/SiC interface when considering the comprehensive performance. This work puts forward an important thermal-mechanical perspective to evaluate interface bonding quality for practical applications, and removes a headache barrier toward wafer-scale high-yield integration of Si active layers onto SiC substrates to greatly enhance SOI devices&#39; thermal management.},

This study systematically investigated the electrical properties, microstructure, elemental valence states, and energy-band alignment of these heterojunctions through multiple analytical techniques. Current–voltage measurements revealed an asymmetric, nonlinear behavior due to the depletion region at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface, with annealing further enhancing electrical performance by yielding a lower turn-on voltage of 0.3 V, an increased rectification ratio of 81.1, and a reduced ideality factor of 6.69. Band structure analysis showed that both the conduction band offset and valence band offset at the ZnO:Cu/ZnO interface increase, indicating a higher barrier height, resulting in more pronounced rectification behavior. X-ray diffraction showed that the laser-treated samples have polycrystalline structures, and annealing improved the crystallinity, thereby enhancing the conductivity. Furthermore, secondary ion mass spectroscopy confirmed the deep implantation of high concentrations of Cu ions into ZnO. Depth‐profiling x‐ray photoelectron spectra revealed the co-presence of Cu + and Cu 2+ , both of which contribute to the p -type conductivity.

However, the specific contact resistance values of p-GaN remain limited to the range of mid-10 −2 Ω cm 2 due to the low activation ratio of Mg dopants and high work function. Here, we propose an Ohmic contact method using a Pd-based metal stack to achieve lower specific contact resistance compared to conventional p-GaN contact metals such as Ni/Au or Pt/Au. A low specific contact resistance of 1.08 × 10 −5 Ω cm 2 was demonstrated for p-GaN by annealing a Pd-based tri-layer metal contact in an oxygen-rich ambient with an optimized Pd thickness. The mechanism driving this low specific contact resistance was investigated using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicated the mutual diffusion of Ni, Pd, and Ga atoms within the metal alloy. A NiO layer was formed on the top of the metal alloy, and Pd-Ga compounds were formed at the metal/p-GaN interface through mutual diffusion of atoms. This process increased the number of Ga vacancies in p-GaN, playing a crucial role in reducing its contact resistance.},

The hole mobility for CsPbBr 3 at room temperature is modest to be around 25 cm 2 /(V · s). The value of the corresponding power-law index n for hole mobility on temperature (μ ∼ T -n ) is around −1.23 in the range of 155–350 K, which is well consistent with the previous FET and Hall effect measurements, as well as theoretical calculations. The polar optical phonon rather than acoustic phonon is confirmed to be responsible for scattering carriers at room temperature.

  abstract     = {This study explores the impact of constant forward electrical stress on beta-gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) from the prospective of defect evolution. Prolonged stress significantly increased the reverse leakage current density ( J R ) and forward current density ( J F ) under small bias and decreased the turn-on voltage ( V on ). Temperature-dependent current-voltage ( I-V-T ) analysis revealed that the reverse leakage current is dominated by Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission in both fresh and stressed SBDs, while the forward current transport mechanism transforms from thermionic emission (TE) to trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) after stress. Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) results identified an intrinsic trap E 2 * (E C - 0.75 eV) within the β -Ga 2 O 3 drift layer, which is likely a Ga vacancy-related trap. The consistency of this energy level with the PF barrier proves that the increase in this trap is the main reason for the increase in J R . The spatial distribution features that the increase in trap concentration near the metal-semiconductor interface is much larger than that inside the bulk, which establishes the association between this trap and J F under small bias and V on . These findings highlight the critical role of trap evolution in SBD performance degradation under electrical stress.},

Featuring a 7 nm AlN barrier layer and the regrown n + -GaN Ohmic contacts, the device shows low sheet and contact resistances, leading to 1.6-A/mm output current, 3-V knee voltage, and consequent 75% power-added efficiency (PAE) and 1.3-W/mm output power density ( P out ) at 2.6 GHz and 6-V drain voltage ( V DS ). This PAE- P out result represents the state-of-the-art levels of low-voltage power amplifiers (LV PAs) for sub-6G applications. Meanwhile, the TAB-HEMT is found to exhibit satisfactory linearity and noise performance as well. The OIP3 (output third-order intercept point) value of 35.3 dBm is obtained at 6-V V DS , thanks to the elaborately designed thick AlN barrier. A minimum noise figure ( NF min ) as low as 0.32 dB at 2.6 GHz and V DS = 6 V is achieved thanks to the suppressed thermal noise enabled by low channel resistance. These results highlight the potential of the TAB-HEMT as an all-around and compact device platform for LV RF front-end-module applications.},

In this study, we investigate freestanding VO 2 microbeams that undergo reversible transitions from an insulating triclinic (T) phase to an insulating monoclinic (M2) phase, followed by a transition to the R phase. The latent heat changes associated with these first-order phase transitions are monitored using a recently developed chip-based differential scanning calorimetry technique, which demonstrates exceptional sensitivity and resolving power. A series of sharp endothermic and exothermic peaks are observed during the temperature ramping process. In contrast to the abrupt and complete transformation typically observed in conventional insulator-to-metal transitions, our findings reveal a scenario in which multiple domains coexist, and phase transitions occur sequentially within each domain. These results underscore the intricate relationship between domain dynamics and the multiple phase structures in VO 2 . Furthermore, they highlight the potential of advanced thermal analysis techniques to detect subtle thermal signals associated with phase transition processes, providing fresh insights into the underlying mechanisms.},

Here, we proposed a hitherto unknown layered carbon structure, designated as pop -graphite, synthesizable from high-pressure prepared sodium–carbon compounds. Through ab initio evolutionary structure searches and first-principles calculations, we identify a thermodynamically stable layered NaC 3 intercalation compound at 14.0 GPa, featuring a distinctive edge-sharing penta-octa-penta ( pop ) carbon framework with intercalated sodium atoms. Upon sodium removal, the resultant pop -graphite structure remains stable under ambient conditions, exhibiting superior electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility compared to conventional graphite. Our calculations reveal its intrinsic metallic nature and single-gap superconductivity, driven by electron–phonon coupling involving C p z states.

Our first-principles density functional theory calculations uncover that the phase transformation is due to the variation of Sn atomic coordination accompanied by the Sn–I polyhedral distortion. Both phases are indirect bandgap, which is smaller than the atmospheric phase. Further calculations show that intrapolyhedral Sn−Sn hybridization and interpolyhedral I–I coupling lead to the Sn–I polyhedral distortion.

However, currently developed LARHEAs generally have poor room temperature ductility, which greatly limits their wide applications. In this study, two kinds of LARHEAs with chemical compositions of TiZrTaCr and TiZrTaV in equal atomic percentage were designed based on low neutron absorption cross section, low neutron activation, and mixing enthalpy parameters. The LARHEA samples were prepared by high vacuum arc-melting techniques, and their phase structures and mechanical properties were studied. It was found that the TiZrTaCr LARHEA exhibited two body-center-cubic (BCC) and one Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound phases, and it had a yield strength of 1364 ± 54 MPa, but it was brittle, while the TiZrTaV LARHEA formed three BCC solid solution phases, and it had a high yield strength of 1312 ± 57 MPa with a room temperature compression plasticity of 13% ± 0.8%. Cr 2 Zr intermetallic compound formation in the solid solution matrix could have led to the brittleness of the LARHEAs, which was mainly due to the large negative mixing enthalpy of the Cr element with Zr element in this alloy system. This study proposed a basic method for LARHEA design to optimize the microstructures and improve the mechanical properties as structural materials.},

Here, we proposed a multifunctional LWIR metasurface emitter with a switchable radiation state, which consists of germanium (Ge) rectangular pair resonators placed on a vanadium oxide (VO 2 ) film. By manipulating the reversible metal-to-insulator phase transition of phase change material VO 2 , the spatial and spectral emission characteristics could be dynamically controlled. The high loss of metallic VO 2 enables broadband emission in the LWIR band. The average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range reaches 91.3% and exhibits wide-angle emission properties. When the VO 2 is transformed to the insulating phase, the coupling effect of the symmetry-breaking rectangle with two quasi-bound states in the continuum modes enhances the emission intensity of VO 2 at a selective wavelength. This results in narrowband emission with a high-quality factor (Q-factor) and high directional selectivity. Notably, the emission peak&#39;s linewidth is only 28 nm, with a Q-factor of 293, and the average emissivity in the 8–12 μ m range drops to 9.4%. Overall, the proposed metasurface device achieves an LWIR emissivity switching ratio of 9.7 between its two operating modes, showcasing significant differences in spectral and spatial radiation characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Open stopband (OSB) mitigation techniques are commonly used to improve the far-field radiating properties of leaky-wave antennas based on periodic structures. Recently, leaky waves have been proposed to focus energy in the near field through Bessel beams. However, the focusing character of Bessel beams is notably limited to a maximum distance known as the nondiffractive range . In this work, an OSB mitigation technique is originally exploited to significantly extend the nondiffractive range of a Bessel beam generated by a leaky-wave launcher in the microwave/millimeter-wave range. A comprehensive analysis of this device is presented, comparing the performance of the proposed launcher with the typical structure of a leaky-wave Bessel-beam launcher where the OSB is not suppressed. Theoretical results, corroborated by full-wave simulations, demonstrate that the proposed device achieves an impressive nondiffractive range of about 25 m. The latter, at 30 GHz, approximately corresponds to 2500 wavelengths (in vacuum) and to 50 times the aperture diameter which is about 50 cm. These results look particularly attractive for, e.g., near-field communications and wireless power transfer applications, where focusing energy in narrow regions and over large distances is a key factor.},

In this work, we theoretically propose a temperature-tunable terahertz (THz) chiral absorber based on a metasurface of Ag–VO 2 nested split-rings. Perfect absorption of left-handed circularly polarized light (LCP) exceeding 99% and weak absorption of only about 6% of right-handed circularly polarized light (RCP) are achieved at 7.24 THz in frequency. The discrepancy in absorption responses of LCP and RCP results in a large circular dichroism (CD) of 0.94. The CD value in the THz region can be actively modulated between 0.02 and 0.94 by controlling the phase transition of VO 2 , which is closely related to the ambient temperature. Moreover, near-field imaging and encrypted presentation are realized by leveraging the metasurface and its mirror-image properties. Our work holds significant promise in widespread fields including THz intelligent absorption, imaging, and chiral detection.},

  abstract     = {Polarization is one of the basic properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves, and polarization conversion is essential in many terahertz (THz) applications, including communications and sensitive measurements. Due to the limitations of the materials and process, existing THz polarization converters generally have the disadvantages of narrow operating frequency band and non-flexibility. We experimentally demonstrate a flexible ultra-broadband THz polarization converter operating in reflection. It can efficiently convert a linearly polarized THz wave to its orthogonal counterpart in a broadband regime. The device consists of three layers: the lower metal film, the middle dielectric layer, and the upper metal resonance structure array. The unit cell of the upper metal resonance structure is a four-open-ring formed by subtracting two metal bars from a metal ring. The position of the opening is in the diagonal direction of 45° from the upper right corner to the lower left corner of the unit structure. The device is simulated using a full wave EM simulation software and fabricated by a surface micromachining process. The test experiment is completed using a THz-TDS spectrometer and the results show that the polarization conversion ratio is more than 0.8 in an ultra-broadband regime from 1.45 to 2.67 THz. This ultra-broadband conversion is mainly caused by the magnetic resonance of THz waves. More importantly, the convertible frequency band can be tailored for practical applications across the EM spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Drop impact on non-wetting surfaces has garnered significant interest due to its potential applications in water repellency, drag reduction, self-cleaning, and anti-icing. However, there are instances where a droplet fails to rebound from a superhydrophobic surface. It has been reported that the combined effect of gravito-capillary length and visco-capillary length determines the pinning–bouncing criteria. While the fluid properties, such as viscosity and weight, are often considered primary factors influencing droplet rebound, this study highlights the crucial role of surface characteristics, particularly the contact angle hysteresis, in determining post-impact behavior. We propose a modified criterion that predicts droplet bouncing and pinning on superhydrophobic surfaces by integrating both fluid properties and the contact angle hysteresis of the surface. The findings emphasize the importance of surface morphology in droplet dynamics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of droplet behavior on non-wetting surfaces.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive study of silicon germanium (SiGe) cladded channels for stacked nanowires (NWs), focusing on morphological control and strain engineering to enhance device performance. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize the Si NWs and SiGe cladding morphology. The results demonstrate that the morphology of SiGe cladding can be controlled by adjusting the high-temperature H 2 baking conditions, leading to shapes such as triangular, circular, and hexagonal. Technology computer-aided design simulations and geometric phase analysis of TEM images revealed that the maximum compressive stress of SiGe cladding is 3 GPa, corresponding to a compressive strain of 2.48%, which significantly enhances hole mobility. Electrical performance tests and simulations on p -type metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor devices with different morphologies showed excellent short-channel effect control, with a subthreshold swing (SS) of approximately 70 mV/dec and a drain-induced barrier lowering of only 40 mV/V. These findings provide valuable guidelines for fabricating high-quality SiGe channels with controlled structures, enabling the realization of high carrier mobilities in future devices.},

In this study, we report a strategy using functionally graded lattice structures (FGLS) to manipulate the multipactor of the ceramic surface. First, particle-in-cell simulations were conducted to study the secondary electron avalanche process. Simulation results indicated that the interaction between electrons and FGLS hinders the development of secondary electron avalanche. Also, a few positive charges can be accumulated on the ceramic surface since FGLS eliminates the macroscopic interface between insulators and vacuum. Subsequently, stereolithography 3D printing technology was adopted to fabricate ceramic insulators with FGLS, and a further experimental characterization verifies the reduction of secondary electron yield, especially for surfaces with finer structures.},

  abstract     = {We report on the fabrication and characterization of p–n diodes made from wide bandgap II-VI semiconductors (p-ZnTe/n-CdTe) containing nano-inclusions of narrow bandgap material (PbTe). The diodes are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy on semi-insulating GaAs (100) substrates. The PbTe nano-inclusions are formed either as a single layer of PbTe with a thickness of 350 nm or as multilayers built from alternating thin layers of PbTe and CdTe. Comparison of cross-sectional scanning electron microscope images with electron beam-induced current measurements confirms that the PbTe nano-inclusions are located in depletion regions of the diodes. Despite the presence of the highly conductive, narrow bandgap PbTe semiconductor between the p- an n-type layers, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices show rectifying behavior and acceptable diode parameters in the wide temperature range of 60–290 K. The p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes with PbTe nano-inclusions exhibit significant sensitivity to infrared radiation starting at the wavelength of about 1.5 μ m and with a long-wavelength cutoff of 3.9 and 5.4 μ m at 290 and 50 K, respectively. A peak sensitivity appears at a wavelength of 2.29 μ m and reaches the maximum of almost 1 V/W at a temperature of 150 K. The temperature dependence of the cutoff wavelength clearly shows that the sensitivity to infrared radiation of the wide bandgap p-ZnTe/n-CdTe diodes is due to band-to-band optical excitations taking place in PbTe nano-inclusions. The results presented here prove that such diodes can be used for infrared sensing or for two-color infrared solar cells.},

The newly designed fluorinated cationic chromophore, 6-fluoro-2-(4-hydroxystyryl)-1-methylquinolinium (OH6FQ), has been incorporated with various fluorinated or non-fluorinated anions into six different ionic crystals. Notably, the tetrafluorinated crystals, composed of fluorinated OH6FQ cations and trifluorinated anions, meet essential requirements for efficient THz wave generation, including large macroscopic optical nonlinearity, optimal facet orientation in as-grown crystals with mm-size, plate-like morphology, and relatively low THz absorption across both the entire-molecular phonon and anion-stretching vibration regions. These tetrafluorinated crystals exhibit over 20 times higher optical-to-THz amplitude conversion efficiency compared to inorganic ZnTe, with a broad bandwidth extending up to 16 THz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of tetrafluorinated ionic organic THz crystals, showing promising potential for diverse THz photonic and nonlinear optical applications.},

  abstract     = {It is thought that schemes for quantum imaging are fragile against realistic environments in which the background noise is often stronger than the nonclassical signal of the imaging photons. Unfortunately, it is unfeasible to produce brighter quantum light sources to alleviate this problem. Here, we overcome this paradigmatic limitation by developing a quantum imaging scheme that relies on the use of natural sources of light. This is achieved by performing conditional detection on the photon number of the thermal light field scattered by a remote object. Specifically, the conditional measurements in our scheme enable us to extract quantum features of the detected thermal photons to produce quantum images with improved signal-to-noise ratios. This technique shows an exponential enhancement in the contrast of quantum images. This measurement scheme enables the possibility of producing images from the vacuum fluctuations of the light field. This is experimentally demonstrated through the implementation of a single-pixel camera with photon-number-resolving capabilities. As such, we believe that our scheme opens a new paradigm in the field of quantum imaging. It also unveils the potential of combining natural light sources with nonclassical detection schemes for the development of robust quantum technologies.},

We propose an all-dielectric multilayer film metasurface to create an optical resonator and its perfectly mirrored counterpart, inducing FP-BICs and validating the conclusions.

  abstract     = {Controlling and enhancing light–matter coupling at subwavelength scales is an essential requirement in the realm of meta-photonics. Recently, all-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs) governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a standout platform for delivering high-quality (Q) factor resonances and near-field electromagnetic hotspots. However, in the terahertz (THz) domain, experimental validation of high-Q BICs resonances with strong robustness and advanced maneuverability in such all-dielectric photonic systems remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and feasible fabrication approach to unlock the full potential of BICs-inspired resonances within the array of silicon cross elliptical resonators. Our results suggest that the designed THz-MS can support two symmetry-protected BICs with a topological charge of ±1 and several accidental BICs with a topological charge of +1 simultaneously. By introducing small perturbations to the individual resonator, the original two symmetry-protected BICs transform into quasi-BICs that bow to the inverse-square law. Astoundingly, for larger symmetry breaking, two additional BICs can be observed in the asymmetric THz-MSs surpass typical inverse-square rule, hence presenting a supererogatory degree of freedom for tailoring BICs resonances on demand. We bear out theoretical findings by transmission experiments implemented on the fabricated samples. We observe experimentally ultrasharp dual quasi-BICs resonances with a highest measured Q factor of up to 371, a level of performance that was previously unattainable with all-dielectric THz-MS on a substrate. The results mark an important step toward enriching the family of BICs and promise exciting opportunities in the field of THz optoelectronic devices and metadevices.},

Among the different growth methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers high flexibility and has demonstrated the ability to produce oxide films hosting rare-earth ions with narrow linewidths. However, growing epitaxial films directly on silicon is challenging by CVD due to a native amorphous oxide layer formation at the interface. In this manuscript, we investigate the CVD growth of erbium-doped yttrium oxide (Er:Y 2 O 3 ) thin films on different substrates, including silicon, sapphire, quartz, or yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Alternatively, growth was also attempted on an epitaxial Y 2 O 3 template layer on Si (111) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to circumvent the issue of the amorphous interlayer. We found that the substrate impacts the film morphology and the crystalline orientations, with different textures observed for the CVD film on the MBE-oxide/Si template (111) and epitaxial growth on YSZ (001). In terms of optical properties, Er 3+ ions exhibit visible and IR emission features that are comparable for all samples, indicating a high-quality local crystalline environment regardless of the substrate. Our approach opens interesting prospects to integrate such films into scalable devices for optical quantum technologies.},

Benefiting from high crystallinity and polarization-sensitive absorption of prepared ultrathin β-Ga 2 O 3 flake in monoclinic structure, the β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetector exhibits an ultra-fast response speed (100/78 μ s for rise/decay time) and a prominent anisotropy ratio (∼2.8) of polarization photoresponse under 265 nm illumination. An unambiguous detection of linearly polarized light has also been realized by the double symmetry-breaking of twisted β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetectors. Moreover, a four-layer twistedly stacked detection system further enables a one-step and well-defined polarization imaging with high resolution (150 × 150 pixels) to acquire spatial polarization information. This work presents a novel strategy for preparing ultrathin 2D gallium oxides and demonstrates a promising route to realize well-defined solar-blind polarization imaging in a simple manner.},

  abstract     = {The proximity effect has long been recognized as the primary driver of static transport behavior in superconductor/ferromagnetic heterostructures, yet the understanding of magnetic dynamics in this context remains limited. Here, we demonstrate a significant shift of ferromagnetic resonance spectra in ferromagnetic films placed between two superconductor gating layers. Through deliberate modifications of the interface structure using various insertion layers, we have determined that the superconducting proximity effect has a minimal impact on the modulation of ferromagnetic resonance characteristics. Instead, our findings strongly support very recent theoretical predictions that emphasize the phenomenon of ultrastrong coupling between Kittel magnons and Cooper pairs arising from the superconducting magnetoelectric effect. We propose that this ultrastrong coupling not only provides a precise method for determining superconducting parameters like the London penetration depth but also lays the foundation for the manipulation of spin waves through superconductors in future magnonic circuits.},

Here, we report a fabrication method of optoelectrical probes for precise modulation of neurons. A linear array of flip-chipped green resonant-cavity μ LEDs (RCLED) with an emitting aperture of 50 μ m is integrated on Si platform as the stimulation source. Due to the top/bottom Bragg reflectors, the RCLEDs&#39; output light view-angle is narrowed to &lt;90°. The emission wavelength demonstrates remarkable stability under various injection current densities. Under the 50 A/cm 2 driving current density, the RCLEDs&#39; output optical density is 100 mW/mm 2 and maximum temperature rise is 0.5 °C, both of which exhibit great improvement compared with those of the optical probes on sapphire substrate. Using these green RCLED probes to stimulate Mac-mCherry photosensitive protein, the analgesia and inhibition effects for medium prefrontal cortex GABAergic neurons are verified.

  abstract     = {As an effective method for thermal management technologies, doping or substitution has been extensively utilized to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of various materials. Intensive studies have been conducted about the phonon mechanism of isoelectronic alloying since the 1950s. Very recently, the specific role of aliovalent doping was elucidated in the half-Heusler NbFeSb system. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally investigated the mechanism of reducing thermal conductivity through aliovalent doping by combining first-principles calculations and neutron diffraction studies for the case study of the TiCoSb half-Heusler system. The softening of the acoustic branches induced by aliovalent doping can effectively reduce the phonon group velocities. Moreover, the introduction of compensating defects, resulting from changes in the Fermi level, plays a vital role in decreasing the relaxation time of phonons, as demonstrated by the analysis of neutron powder diffraction. Due to these two factors, doping with adjacent elements results in a significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity (for instance, Ni doping at the Co site in the TiCoSb half-Heusler system), especially in the low-temperature range. Our findings provide valuable insight into the phonon scattering mechanism in aliovalent-doped materials and demonstrate the role of compensating defects in heat transport, which is applicable to other doped semiconductor systems.},

By integrating x-ray-guided wireless manipulation with UMRs, we aim to address challenges associated with precise and controlled blood clot intervention. The untethered nature and size of these robots enhance maneuverability and accessibility within complex vascular networks, potentially improving clot removal efficiency. We explore mechanical fragmentation, chemical lysis, and hybrid dissolution techniques that combine mechanical fragmentation with chemical lysis, highlighting their potential for targeted and efficient blood clot removal. Through experimental validation using an ex vivo endovascular thrombosis model within the iliac artery of a sheep, we demonstrate direct revascularization of a 13-mm-long, 1-day-old blood clot positioned inside the left common iliac artery. This was achieved by deploying a UMR into the abdominal aorta within 15 min. Additionally, both mechanical fragmentation and hybrid dissolution achieve a greater volume rate of change compared to no intervention (control) and chemical lysis alone. Mechanical fragmentation exhibits clot removal with a median of 0.87 mm 3 /min and a range of 2.81 mm 3 /min, while the hybrid approach demonstrates slower but more consistent clot removal, with a median of 0.45 mm 3 /min and a range of 0.23 mm 3 /min.},

  abstract     = {Phototransistors have great application prospects in automotive vehicle, smart home, healthcare, imaging, and display. However, so far, there has been no report of flexible phototransistors that simultaneously achieve both high mobility and detectivity. Additionally, phototransistors are conventionally relied on thick channel layers and previous thin channel layers based devices only show poor performance. Here, we report flexible phototransistors based on ultrathin niobium-doped indium oxide (InNbO, 5 nm)/indium tin oxide (ITO, 3 nm) channel layers, which possess high mobility (49.21 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and high detectivity (3.02 × 10 14 Jones) simultaneously. Significantly, the devices offer a broad spectral responsivity (from violet to green emissions). We postulate that the high mobility can be ascribed to the diffusion of Sn atoms (from ITO) and conduction band offset (between InNbO and ITO), while the high detectivity originates from the low dark current. To illustrate the capabilities of flexible phototransistors, we demonstrate both a flexible active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display pixel circuit and an imaging system. Our approach unlocks new possibilities to achieve flexible phototransistors with superior performance, which suggest a great potential in next-generation flexible, stretchable, bendable, and low-cost electronics.},

  abstract     = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a prominent branch of non-linear optics (NLO) heavily reliant on conventional bulk NLO crystals. However, the difficulty in downsizing these crystals imposes technical limitations on the future of miniaturized NLO devices. Tellurene emerges as a promising candidate to overcome these restrictions, excelling in electrical applications and believed to possess a giant second-order optical susceptibility comparable to conventional NLO crystals. In this study, a face-to-face substrate configuration is employed for the synthesis of ultrathin tellurene via PVD. Our findings reveal that tellurene&#39;s SHG performance surpasses that of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides by two orders of magnitude, with maximum efficiency when the flake thickness is between 16 and 20 nm under various wavelengths. High sensitivity to thickness variation encourages post-growth thinning through hydrogen plasma etching, enabling precise engineering of the flake thickness for optimal SHG. This establishes a foundation for controlled tellurene thickness, further broadening its potential in diverse applications.},

However, despite decades of study, the inability to separate surface properties from those of the bulk has made a deep understanding of the physics of BAs elusive. Building on the theory of the ideal vacuum level to separate surface from bulk [Choe et al. , Phys. Rev. B 103 , 235202 (2021)], here we present a geometric theory for the band alignment, specifically explaining the insensitivity of the alignment to interfacial orientation between isotropic materials. First, we adopt a neutral polyhedron, termed Wigner-Seitz atoms (WSA), to partition the charge of atoms in a way that maintains crystal symmetry and tessellates the space. In contrast to the CWZ theory, the band alignment of two materials constructed from such WSAs is independent of interface orientation. Upon electron relaxation at the interface, we show that the interfacial charge transfer dipole can be accurately described by the sum of localized point dipoles that exist between atoms at the interface (bond dipoles). For interfaces between isotropic materials, the magnitude of the bond dipole can be factored out as a multiplier, leaving only geometric factors, such as crystal symmetry and dimension of the material, to determine band alignment, regardless of the orientation of the interface. We considered 29 distinct interfaces and found that this bond dipole theory yields excellent agreement (RMS deviation &lt; 30 meV) with first-principles results. Our theory can be easily applied to interface between alloys, as well as between anisotropic systems.},

For the first time, we have successfully achieved significant regulation of ABMR through the application of gate voltage. Our quantified analysis reveals a profound link between the tunable anisotropy in Rashba spin splitting and the precise modulation of the Fermi level filling, highlighting its central role in governing gate-modulated ABMR. Additionally, we introduce a rigorous physical model that provides a deep and nuanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying gate-voltage-controlled ABMR.

Despite more than half a century of study, unraveling the underlying transport physics within this space has been nontrivial due to the complex electronic structure, disorder, and small bandgap within these alloys. Furthermore, as Peltier coolers, Bi 1− x Sb x alloys operate in a bipolar regime; as such, understanding the impact of minority carriers is critical for further improvements in device performance. This study unites first principles calculations with low-temperature experimental measurements to create a generalized model for transport within semiconducting Bi-Sb alloys. Our exploration reveals the interplay between the complex, degenerate valence band structure with the extremely light conduction bands. By building a hybrid computational/experimental model, an understanding of both the electron and hole relaxation times emerges both as a function of temperature and energy. Special quasi-random supercell calculations reveal that, despite significant atomic disorder, the electronic band structures within the alloy remains largely unaffected and electron–phonon scattering dominates. For charge carriers near the band edges, the relaxation times are thus extremely long, consistent with cyclotronic behavior appearing at low magnetic fields ( ⁠ ≪ 1 T). Modeling thermoelectric performance suggests that the valence band edge deformation potential is significantly weaker and highlights the potential for p -type compositions to meet or exceed the current n -type alloys.},

  abstract     = {As a wide bandgap semiconductor, diamond holds both excellent electrical and thermal properties, making it highly promising in the electrical industry. However, its hole mobility is relatively low and dramatically decreases with increasing temperature, which severely limits further applications. Herein, we proposed that the hole mobility can be efficiently enhanced via slight compressive shear strain along the [100] direction, while the improvement via shear strain along the [111] direction is marginal. This impressive distinction is attributed to the deformation potential and the elastic compliance matrix. The shear strain breaks the symmetry of the crystalline structure and lifts the band degeneracy near the valence band edge, resulting in a significant suppression of interband electron–phonon scattering. Moreover, the hole mobility becomes less temperature-dependent due to the decrease of electron scatterings from high-frequency acoustic phonons. Remarkably, the in-plane hole mobility of diamond is increased by ∼ 800 % at 800 K with a 2% compressive shear strain along the [100] direction. The efficient shear strain strategy can be further extended to other semiconductors with face-centered cubic geometry.},

  abstract     = {Recently developed van der Waals magnets offer a promising platform for advancing spintronics. The weak interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange coupling in van der Waals antiferromagnets allows for unique spin dynamics and control over magnons. In this study, we present the excitation and detection of coherent magnon transport in the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS 4 . We observe pronounced coherent magnon–magnon coupling between the optical and acoustic magnon branches, resulting in hybridized magnon modes that can be tuned by modulating the coupling strength, enabling a tunability across a broad frequency range exceeding 10 GHz. The group velocity of the antiferromagnetic magnons is estimated to be approximately 3.8 km/s. Additionally, we experimentally determine the magnon dispersion in CrPS 4 by varying the magnon wavevectors and propose an analytical model for the antiferromagnetic magnon dispersion in CrPS 4 . Our findings open new avenues for energy-efficient magnonic devices based on van der Waals antiferromagnets.},

At the atomistic scale, it is demonstrated that Mo dopant-induced localized strain accelerates the phase transition, which leads to the relaxation of the tetragonal structure. Furthermore, the effects of Mo doping on the phase transition process and electrical properties are characterized at the nanoscale using conductive atomic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy, and the potential application in selectors can be evaluated. The results indicated that Mo doping destabilizes the M1 phase by introducing a high density of electrons, thereby significantly reducing the electron–electron interactions as per the Mott model. Moreover, the device exhibited stable threshold and memristive properties at room temperature, quickly switching from high to low-resistance states at a threshold voltage of 2.37 V and maintaining stability over more than 1000 cycles with a selectivity &gt;10 2 .

This study focuses on three-terminal synaptic transistors utilizing graphene and P(VDF-TrFE) to achieve dynamic reconfigurability between excitatory and inhibitory response modes, which are crucial for mimicking biological functions. The devices operate by applying different top gate spikes (±25 V and ±10 V) to modulate the polarization degree of P(VDF-TrFE), thereby regulating the carrier type and concentration in the graphene channel. This results in the effective realization of enhancement and inhibition processes in two neural-like states: excitatory and inhibitory modes, accompanied by good neural plasticity with paired-pulse facilitation and spike-time-dependent plasticity. With these features, the synaptic devices achieve brain-like memory enhancement and human-like perception functions, exhibiting excellent stability, durability over 1000 cycles, and a long retention period exceeding 10 years. Additionally, the performance of the artificial neural network is evaluated for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 92.28%.

Although these applications are dependent on the optical performance, the origin of the optical absorption in electrochromic oxides is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that the electrochromism of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides can be described by a combination of polaron and bipolaron hopping. Based on the valences of the metallic constituents, we model experimental optical absorption spectra by polaron theory and assign two prominent absorption peaks to polaronic and bipolaronic charge transfer excitations. However, in the special case of V 2 O 5 , three peaks were necessary to fit the optical spectra. The activation energies of polaronic and bipolaronic hopping were remarkably similar for all the cathodic oxides studied. Within the framework of polaron absorption, V 2 O 5 would be categorized as a cathodic oxide, rather than as a mixed anodic/cathodic material as in the conventional picture. We emphasize that our findings here not only offer a profound understanding of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides but also pave the way for exploring electrochromic oxides with dual-band modulations.},

Furthermore, our observations and characterizations of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in the respective phases of the VO 2 film offer valuable insight into their electron structures. This investigation enhances comprehension of the MIT mechanism in correlated systems and underscores the roles of polarons, lattice distortions, and electron correlations in facilitating phase transition processes in strongly correlated systems.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional materials with multiple degrees of freedom, including spin, valleys, and orbitals, open up an exciting avenue for engineering multifunctional devices. Beyond spintronics, these degrees of freedom can lead to novel quantum effects such as valley-dependent Hall effects and orbital magnetism, which could revolutionize next-generation electronics. However, achieving independent control over valley polarization and orbital magnetism has been a challenge due to the need for large electric fields. A recent breakthrough involving pentalayer rhombohedral graphene has demonstrated the ability to individually manipulate anomalous Hall signals and orbital magnetic hysteresis, forming what is known as a valley-magnetic quartet. Here, we leverage the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity of pentalayer rhombohedral graphene to develop nonvolatile memory and in-memory computation applications. We propose an architecture for a dense, scalable, and selector-less nonvolatile memory array that harnesses the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity. In our designed array architecture, nondestructive read and write operations are conducted by sensing the valley state through two different pairs of terminals, allowing for independent optimization of read/write peripheral circuits. The power consumption of our PRG-based array is remarkably low, with only ∼6 nW required per write operation and ∼2.3 nW per read operation per cell. This consumption is orders of magnitude lower than that of the majority of state-of-the-art cryogenic memories. Additionally, we engineer in-memory computation by implementing majority logic operations within our proposed nonvolatile memory array without modifying the peripheral circuitry. Our framework presents a promising pathway toward achieving ultra-dense cryogenic memory and in-memory computation capabilities.},

Apart from overcoming issues of fluidic damping and electrical interfaces, there is a great challenge of bringing microanalytes to these devices with the required precision and scaling for high throughput sensing. Herein, we address the above challenges by proposing a self-excited localized acoustic manipulation methodology based on a piezoelectric micromechanical diaphragm resonator (PMDR). Such a PMDR integrates acoustofluidics and mass sensing functions in tandem on a single device. Particle enrichment is realized within tens of seconds and the limit of detection is enhanced by mitigating common issues such as low capture rate and non-uniform distribution. The developed PMDR is versatile in its applicability to a range of particle sizes and densities for both acoustofluidic actuation and in situ mass sensing.

  abstract     = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been studied intensively, and their practical applications are advancing. The efficiency of light-emitting materials has been improved significantly through the understanding of their emission mechanisms. However, the correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the operating voltage in OLEDs remains unclear, because OLEDs require a complex multilayer configuration that includes many materials other than the emitter. It is difficult to investigate the exact energy diagram for OLEDs, which have many interfaces, and many uncertainties remain regarding the mechanisms of charge injection and recombination. In this review, we introduce both the charge injection and recombination mechanisms in OLEDs and the interface control technology effective for lowering their operating voltage. We explain the electron injection mechanism at organic/cathode interfaces, which is clarified by using organic bases as the electron injection layers. The hole injection mechanism in OLEDs, which is clarified by investigating the correlation between the characteristics of OLEDs and the actual energy levels at organic/anode interfaces, is also introduced. With the elucidation of the charge injection mechanism, holes and electrons can now be injected into various organic materials. These charge injection techniques minimize the voltage required for charge recombination. The correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the minimum voltage required for OLED operation is clarified by controlling the energy levels at organic/organic interfaces. Understanding this correlation enables the design of molecules for ultralow-voltage OLEDs, thereby realizing blue OLEDs with an extremely low turn-on voltage of about 1.5 V.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear optics has long been a cornerstone of modern photonics, enabling a wide array of technologies, from frequency conversion to the generation of ultrafast light pulses. Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light–matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations—such as electrons, excitons, and photons—in low-dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.},

Regarding signal enhancement techniques, the main methods include multi-pass cavity enhancement, resonant cavity enhancement, and hollow-core fiber enhancement. As for noise suppression methods, the primary approaches include spatial filtering, shifted excitation Raman difference spectroscopy, polarized Raman spectroscopy, and internal standard correction.

  abstract     = {Smart biomaterials have significantly impacted human healthcare by advancing the development of medical devices designed to function within human tissue, mimicking the behavior of natural tissues. While the intelligence of biomaterials has evolved from inert to active over the past few decades, smart biomaterials take this a step further by making their surfaces or bulk respond based on interactions with surrounding tissues, imparting outcomes similar to natural tissue functions. This interaction with the surrounding tissue helps in creating stimuli-responsive biomaterials, which can be useful in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, autonomous drug delivery, orthopedics, and much more. Traditionally, material engineering focused on refining the static properties of biomaterials to accommodate them within the body without evoking an immune response, which was a major obstacle to their unrestricted operation. This review highlights and explains various engineering approaches currently under research for developing stimuli-responsive biomaterials that tune their outcomes based on responses to bodily factors like temperature, pH, and ion concentration or external factors like magnetism, light, and conductivity. Applications in soft and hard tissue engineering, 4D printing, and scaffold design are also discussed. The advanced application of microfluidics, like organ-on-a-chip models, extensively benefits from the intrinsic smart properties of biomaterials, which are also discussed below. The review further elaborates on how smart biomaterial engineering could revolutionize biosensor applications, thereby improving patient care quality. We delineate the limitations and key challenges associated with biomaterials, providing insights into the path forward and outlining future directions for developing next-generation biomaterials that will facilitate clinical translation.},

Recent advancements in both direct and indirect 3D bioprinting offer promising solutions to construct complex vascular networks by allowing precise control over cell and extracellular matrix placement. The process from shape printing of microvasculature to function formation involves dynamic shift of bioink mechanical properties, mechanical microenvironments, and mechanobiology of endothelial and supporting cells. This review explores how biomechanical and mechanobiological principles are integrated into the bioprinting process to develop functional microvascular networks. Before printing, a top-level design approach based on these principles focuses on the interactions among biomaterials, cell behaviors, and mechanical environments to guide microvascular network fabrication. During printing, biomechanical design of bioinks for different bioprinting techniques, along with optimized biomechanical factors of bioprinting process, ensures accurate microvascular structure reproduction while maintaining cell viability. After printing, the emphasis is on creating a suitable mechanical environment to modulate the mechanobiology of multiple steps of neovascularization, including initiation, morphogenesis, lumen formation, stabilization, and maturation of functional microvasculature. Finally, we discuss future developments based on biomechanical and mechanobiological design to drive the bioprinting of functionalized microvascular networks.},

  abstract     = {The advent of artificial intelligence—deep neural networks (DNNs) in particular—has transformed traditional research methods across many disciplines. DNNs are data driven systems that use large quantities of data to learn patterns that are fundamental to a process. In the realm of artificial electromagnetic materials (AEMs), a common goal is to discover the connection between the AEM&#39;s geometry and material properties to predict the resulting scattered electromagnetic fields. To achieve this goal, DNNs usually utilize computational electromagnetic simulations to act as ground truth data for the training process, and numerous successful results have been shown. Although DNNs have many demonstrated successes, they are limited by their requirement for large quantities of data and their lack of interpretability. The latter results because DNNs are black-box models, and therefore, it is unknown how or why they work. A promising approach which may help to mitigate the aforementioned limitations is to use physics to guide the development and operation of DNNs. Indeed, this physics-informed learning (PHIL) approach has seen rapid development in the last few years with some success in addressing limitations of conventional DNNs. We overview the field of PHIL and discuss the benefits of incorporating knowledge into the deep learning process and introduce a taxonomy that enables us to categorize various types of approaches. We also summarize deep learning principles which are critical to PHIL understanding and the Appendix covers some of the physics of AEMs. A few specific PHIL works are highlighted and serve as examples of various approaches. Finally, we provide an outlook detailing where the field is currently and what we can expect in the future.},

Recent improvements in NaSICON have primarily targeted macroscopic property enhancements and synthesis techniques. To enable further breakthroughs in the performance of NaSICON SEs, future efforts should focus on understanding how modified synthesis conditions influence atomic and microscopic-scale features, such as conduction channels, electronic structures, phase distributions, and grain boundaries. These features ultimately control ion conductivity, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability of NaSICON and its interfaces. Here, we review the current understanding of the structure-chemistry-property relationships of NaSICON SEs, focusing on atomic and microscopic levels. First, we introduce the proposed ionic conduction mechanisms in NaSICON crystallites. Then, we explore experimental investigations at phase and grain boundaries to assess ionic conduction and interfacial stability. We also examine strategies to address interfacial challenges such as high resistance and chemical reactions between SEs and electrodes, highlighting the difficulties in analyzing interfaces at the nano/atomic scale.

Essential to harnessing this energy are nuclear batteries, devices designed to generate electric power by capturing the energy emitted during nuclear decay, including α or β particles and γ radiation. The allure of nuclear batteries lies in their potential for extended lifespan, high energy density, and adaptability in harsh environments where refueling or battery replacement may not be feasible. In this review, we narrow our focus to nuclear batteries utilizing non-thermal converters such as α- or β-voltaics, as well as those employing scintillation intermediates. Recent advancements in state-of-the-art direct radiation detectors and scintillators based on metal perovskite halides (MPHs) and chalcogenides (MCs) are compared to traditional detectors based on silicon and III-V materials, and scintillators based on inorganic lanthanide crystals. Notable achievements in MPH and MC detectors and scintillators, such as nano-Gy sensitivity, 100 photons/keV light yield, and radiation hardness, are highlighted. Additionally, limitations including energy conversion efficiency, power density, and shelf-life due to radiation damage in detectors and scintillators are discussed. Leveraging novel MPH and MC materials has the potential to propel nuclear batteries from their current size and power limitations to miniaturization, heightened efficiency, and increased power density. Furthermore, exploring niche applications for nuclear batteries beyond wireless sensors, low-power electronics, oil well monitoring, and medical fields presents enticing opportunities for future research and development.},

In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing PDs with flexible form factors and using eco-friendly materials and approaches. These efforts have resulted in exploration of degradable materials and printed electronics as a resource-efficient route for manufacturing and to contain end-of-life issues. This paper reviews such new advances, particularly focusing on flexible PDs based on inorganic (e.g., crystalline silicon, compound semiconductors, metal oxides, etc.) semiconductor nanostructures [e.g., Nanowires (NWs), Nanoribbons (NRs), etc.]. The advantages and disadvantages of various bottom-up and top-down methods explored to realize the nanostructures and the wet (solution-processable) and dry printing and assembly methods to print the nanostructures on flexible substrates, are discussed along with their suitability for various applications. This discussion is supported by a comparative analysis of printed PDs in terms of key performance metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, I Light /I Dark ratio, response speed, and external quantum efficiency. This comprehensive discussion is expected to benefit researchers and practitioners from academia and industry interested in the field of printed and flexible PDs.},

Thus, understanding lattice dynamics is crucial for regulating thermal conduction, as the intrinsic limit mainly depends on phonon dispersions. Conventionally, thermal conduction is regulated through heat-carrying acoustic phonon manipulation due to their high group velocities, which are widely utilized in materials such as thermal coatings and thermoelectrics. In recent years, with advancements in thermal transport, optical phonons have been of great interest for tuning thermal conduction, with a particular focus on those with special dispersive behaviors; however, the microscopic mechanisms are significantly different. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effect of optical phonons, especially those with high weights on thermal conduction in advanced materials, as well as discuss the fundamental mechanisms, including (i) phonon bandwidth, (ii) phonon gap, (iii) avoided-crossing, (iv) phonon nesting/twinning, (v) optical-acoustic phonon bunching, and (vi) multiple optical phonons.},

  abstract     = {Quantum states of light, such as fixed photon number (Fock) states, entangled states, and squeezed states, offer important advantages with respect to classical states of light, such as coherent states and thermal states, in different areas: they enable secure communication and distribution of encryption keys, enable realization of sensors with higher sensitivity and resolution, and are considered candidates for quantum computing and simulation applications. To accommodate these applications, suitable methods for generating the quantum states are needed. Today, the quantum states are often produced by a spontaneous nonlinear process in a standard nonlinear material, followed by a series of optical elements necessary for encoding the desired state on the generated photons. In this review, we consider an alternative approach of structuring the nonlinearity of the crystal so that the desired quantum state will be generated directly at the crystal, without the need for additional elements. Our main focus here is on bulk crystals having structured second-order nonlinearity. The rising interest in these nonlinear metamaterials is fueled by advancements in the ability to efficiently simulate and design spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) processes, as well as by new capabilities of structuring the nonlinearity of ferroelectric crystals, either by electric field poling or by laser-induced writing. As a result, nonlinear metamaterials were recently used to directly shape the spatial and spectral correlations of quantum light that is generated in SPDC. The paper covers the theoretical background and the design and fabrication methods of bulk nonlinear metamaterials for generating quantum light, as well as a series of demonstrations of the use of metamaterials in quantum optical applications.},

Its unique optoelectronic properties have indeed raised it to an ideal and revolutionary candidate for the development of entirely novel technologies across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from the microwaves to the x-rays, even crossing domain of intense application relevance, as terahertz (THz) frequencies. Owing to its exceptionally high tensile strength, electrical conductivity, transparency, ultra-fast carrier dynamics, nonlinear optical response to intense fields, electrical tunability, and ease of integration with semiconductor materials, graphene is a key disruptor for the engineering of generation, manipulation, and detection technologies with ad hoc properties, conceived from scratch. In this review, we elucidate the fundamental properties of graphene, with an emphasis on its transport, electronic, ultrafast and nonlinear interactions, and explore its enormous technological potential of integration with a diverse array of material platforms. We start with a concise introduction to graphene physics, followed by the most remarkable technological developments of graphene-based photodetectors, modulators, and sources in the 1–10 THz frequency range. As such, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for a broad audience, ranging from novices to experts, who are keen to explore graphene physics for conceiving and realizing microscale and nanoscale devices and systems in the far infrared.

In light of this, capacitive tactile sensors based on morphological structure designs have gained favor among researchers, gradually forming a “hundred schools of thought contend” trend. Nevertheless, the processes and applicability of morphological structures have yet to form a complete system, and the development and intelligence of morphological-engineering-based capacitive tactile sensors have reached a bottleneck stage, requiring a comprehensive and systematic review to provide inspiration for breakthroughs.

In this article, we present an exhaustive review of the advancements in understanding the fundamental physics behind magnetic skyrmions and the novel data storage and computing technologies based on them. We begin with an in-depth discussion of fundamental concepts such as topological protection, stability, statics, and dynamics essential for understanding skyrmions, henceforth the foundation of skyrmion technologies. For the realization of CMOS-compatible skyrmion functional devices, the writing and reading of the skyrmions are crucial. We discuss the developments in different writing schemes such as STT, SOT, and VCMA. The reading of skyrmions is predominantly achieved via two mechanisms: the magnetoresistive tunnel junction TMR effect and topological resistivity. So, a thorough investigation into the skyrmion Hall effect, topological properties, and emergent fields is also provided, concluding the discussion on skyrmion reading developments. Based on the writing and reading schemes, we discuss the applications of the skyrmions in conventional logic, unconventional logic, memory applications, and neuromorphic computing, including a model of a skyrmion-based SNN architecture achieving over 90% accuracy on MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets.

Among these materials, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been widely investigated in CO 2 reduction and water splitting to produce chemical fuels. However, pure LDHs suffer from sluggish charge-carrier transport, a great electron–hole recombination rate as well as tend to cause agglomeration. Due to the aforementioned bottlenecks, numerous modification techniques have been considerably explored to enhance the potential of LDHs toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 photoreduction. Therefore, this article presents a thorough review of developments made for the construction and modification of LDH photocatalyst properties aiming to enhance water splitting and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The review starts with the techniques adopted to synthesize LDH-based structures toward enhanced structure and morphology. The key semiconducting, optical, and electronic properties are studied to understand the conduct of LDH materials toward excellent photocatalytic material. The study then deliberates the techniques such as morphological engineering, hybridization with conducting and semiconducting materials, vacancy creation and defect engineering, components tuning, photothermal catalysis, heterojunction, and heterostructural engineering employed for the enrichment of photocatalytic properties. The study also discusses the steps taken to enhance the adsorption of LDHs and coupling of computational and operando techniques toward semiconducting, structural, and optical properties to investigate the best-performing photocatalysts. The study also reviews the recent advancements of LDH for applications toward water splitting and CO 2 conversion.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising cancer biomarkers due to their encapsulation of molecular signals reflective of originating tumor cells. Conventional analytical methods often fall short in comprehensive EV molecular profiling, necessitating innovative approaches for enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. This review focuses on the utilization of nanoplasmonic structures for optical signal detection of EVs, exploring advancements, challenges, and future prospects toward single EV molecular profiling. Nanoplasmonic structures offer enhanced optical readout capabilities, leveraging light iridescence, and plasmonic amplification suitable for the size range and complexity of the EVs. We delve into the research and implications of on-chip methods, shedding light on EVs&#39; role in health and disease. Despite notable progress, opportunities still exist to further develop nanoplasmonic arrays, customizing them for bioanalytes of interest, crucial for both label-free and labeled techniques to attain the objectives of their EV profiling. One such example is the use of specific antibodies for surface functionalization in nanoplasmonic arrays. Other approaches involve tailoring the design of platforms to the physical properties of target EVs, thereby enhancing characterization capabilities. The subsequent sections will cover a curated selection of relevant studies. We later discuss EV analysis through plasmonic nanoarrays in clinical sample scenarios. While patterning methods, such as colloidal self-assembly and e-beam lithography, enable integration with microfluidic systems, facilitating future investigations, few technologies have entered clinical trials. This roadblock highlights the need for further development of cost-effective, detailed molecular profiling methods. Moreover, we discuss avenues like single EV profiling and machine learning to address challenges related to heterogeneity of EVs as liquid biopsy biomarkers. Finally, we discuss future opportunities in developing nanoplasmonic-assisted EV profiling and studied their driving advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic realms, such as customizable nanoplasmonic structures coupled with artificial intelligence analysis modules, as a path forward for precise EV molecular profiling, which may enable personalized therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {The classical Fischer–Tropsch to Olefins (FTO) reaction is a pivotal method for converting syngas, derived from fossil energy sources, such as coal, biomass, and natural gas, into lower olefins. The growing interest in expanding or commercializing FTO has driven the development of catalysts with exceptional performance. Lower olefins (C 2–4 = ) are widely used as fundamental components in everyday products such as detergents, lubricants, plastic, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetic additives. Additionally, higher alcohols with functional C– groups can not only improve the atomic utilization in catalytic reactions but also serve as raw materials for combustibles, fuels or fuel additives, and various fine chemicals. In recent years, new transition metal carbide catalysts have attracted significant attention in the exploration and application of FTO catalytic reactions. This paper systematically reviews the research progress of non-noble metal cobalt carbide Co x C ( x = 2, 3) catalysts for the efficient utilization of CO x ( x = 1, 2). The review covers the phase transitions during the formation of Co x C-based catalysts, their properties, activity, product selectivity, and interrelationships among these factors. Finally, the current challenges facing Co x C-based catalysts in effectively harnessing CO x in FTO are discussed, along with perspectives on potential future commercial applications.},

  abstract     = {Magnetoelectric (ME) composites exhibit robust ME interfacial coupling because of the strong interaction between piezoelectricity and magnetostriction. The presence of two novel functionalities, i.e., direct and converse ME couplings, makes them ideal candidates for multifunctional devices such as energy harvesters, magnetic field sensors, ME random access memories, and ME antennas. In these ME composites, ME coupling is strongly dependent on the superior physical properties of the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials. Therefore, magnetostrictive materials with excellent piezomagnetic coefficients and piezoelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric coefficients are required to achieve a large ME coupling. Among the various piezoelectric materials, ferroelectric relaxor-PbTiO 3 (PT) single crystals have been used extensively as piezoelectric constituents because of their ultrahigh piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Furthermore, the domain structure and crystal orientation of the relaxor-PT single crystals exhibit extraordinarily large piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Owing to these multifunctional properties, relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites have been widely used for studying direct and converse ME couplings in ME composites in recent years. Relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites show excellent ME coupling, e.g., the highest ME voltage coefficient, equivalent magnetic noise, and output power of 7000 V cm − 1 Oe − 1 @ 23.23 kHz, 6 pT/√Hz @1 Hz, and 19 mW @ 60 Hz, respectively, which are one of the best-reported values in ME composites so far. Considering the vast research on relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites, we present a detailed review of the recent progress, challenges, and perspectives of ME composites and ME devices based on relaxor-PT single crystals.},

  abstract     = {Developing reliable and efficient single-photon sources is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, relying on nonlinear frequency conversion or spontaneous emission from individual quantum emitters. While different types of single-photon sources excel in specific applications, none meet all criteria for an “ideal” source: exceptional brightness, high purity, and indistinguishability. To address this challenge, coupling single-photon emitters with designer nanostructures can significantly enhance emission performance, a pivotal area in quantum nanophotonics. This review summarizes recent advancements over the past decade in generating and manipulating single photons, emphasizing the pivotal role of nanostructure coupling. Single-photon emission systems—such as nonlinear crystals, solid-state defects, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and two-dimensional materials—are categorized quantitatively based on their ability to achieve high purity, indistinguishability, and brightness, presented in a three-dimensional technology map. Furthermore, nanostructure engineering is showcased for manipulating properties such as emission direction, polarization, chirality, and entanglement of single photons. By elucidating these critical aspects, this review aims to advance understanding of how advancements in nanostructured environments promise to shape the future of single-photon generation and manipulation within quantum nanophotonics.},

  abstract     = {Phase transitions are fundamental phenomena in physics that have been extensively studied owing to their applications across diverse industrial sectors, including energy, power, healthcare, and the environment. An example of such applications in the energy sector is thermal energy storage using phase change materials. In such systems, and indeed in many other thermal systems, an emerging and promising approach involves the use of nanoparticles, which have been extensively studied for their potential to enhance the performance of thermal systems. However, conducting thermodynamic analyses of thermal systems in the presence of nanoparticles proves to be complex and resource-consuming because of the involvement of many parameters, including (i) temperature, molecular structure, and composition of the host fluid in which nanoparticles are either dispersed or in physical contact; (ii) nanoparticle morphology, size, type, and concentration; and (iii) complex interactions between the nanoparticles and the base fluid. This article reviews recent studies on the role of nanoparticles in phase transition processes such as freezing, melting, boiling, evaporation, and condensation. It begins with an overview of phase transition phenomena without nanoparticles, emphasizing the most important controlling parameters, and then examines the underlying physics of nanoparticle-involved phase transitions, critically examining their impact on process speed (transport rates). The article also explores physical phenomena, such as Brownian motion, thermophoresis, microconvection, and nanoparticle agglomeration, and considers their contribution to rate control (enhancement or reduction). Finally, the article presents challenges, research gaps, and suggestions for future exploration, aimed at offering a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between the presence of nanoparticles and the phase transition processes.},

While significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying droplet generation in microchannels and in fabricating devices to produce droplets with varied functionality and high throughput, challenges persist along two important directions. On one side, the generalization of numerical results obtained by computational fluid dynamics would be important to deepen the comprehension of complex physical phenomena in droplet microfluidics, as well as the capability of predicting the device behavior. Conversely, truly three-dimensional architectures would enhance microfluidic platforms in terms of tailoring and enhancing droplet and flow properties. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and additive manufacturing (AM) promise unequaled opportunities for simulating fluid behavior, precisely tracking individual droplets, and exploring innovative device designs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in applying AI and AM to droplet microfluidics. The basic physical properties of multiphase flows and mechanisms for droplet production are discussed, and the current fabrication methods of related devices are introduced, together with their applications. Delving into the use of AI and AM technologies in droplet microfluidics, topics covered include AI-assisted simulations of droplet behavior, real-time tracking of droplets within microfluidic systems, and AM-fabrication of three-dimensional systems. The synergistic combination of AI and AM is expected to deepen the understanding of complex fluid dynamics and active matter behavior, expediting the transition toward fully digital microfluidic systems.},

  abstract     = {Electrokinetic energy harvesting (EKEH) has emerged as a promising renewable and carbon-neutral energy source for small and large-scale applications, reducing the reliance on conventional fossil fuels and providing innovative solutions for remote, off-grid applications. The underlying mechanism of EKEH relies on the movement of dissolved electrolytes over charged fluid–solid interfaces through confinements resulting in the generation of useful power. The low energy conversion efficiency typically observed in larger (micrometer) confinements can be substantially mitigated by shifting to nanometer and sub-nanometer regimes. This down-scaling unlocks high selectivity and provides unique opportunities to potentially harness Angstrom-scale interactions to maintain and elevate fluid permeability. However, EKEH at sub-nanometric scales remains fraught with considerable challenges in fabrication, economic viability, scaling of power, and maintenance, significantly impeding its advancement. In this review, we detail the electrokinetic processes that drive energy conversion in the presence of pressure, concentration, and temperature gradients. We examine the key factors affecting conversion efficiency and explore the innovative solutions in the recent literature addressing associated challenges. Additionally, we highlight the role of novel nanomaterials and specialized geometries along with new fabrication techniques that enable high permeation without sacrificing selectivity in nanometer and sub-nanometer confinements. Finally, we delve into the major obstacles that EKEH currently faces to reach its full potential of extracting clean and affordable energy and conclude by offering insight into future developmental directions and potential breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.},

However, it also can be considered as a wide bandgap semiconductor possessing very large electrical resistivity. The conductivity of various silica films has been studied since the mid-nineteenth century, usually assuming the presence of ionic conductivity. However, in the sense of a wide bandgap semiconductor, the temperature dependence of the resistivity, which ranges over more than four orders of magnitude, can be accurately explained by normal semiconductor behavior under the presumed presence of a deep electron trap/donor residing ∼2.3 eV below the conduction band edge. That is, the conductance is determined by electron motion and not by ions. Experiments have studied the transport of injected electrons (and holes) which are consistent with this viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {The omnipresence of polarized light on the surface of the earth, a result of atmospheric scattering, underscores the significance of detecting this light and extracting valuable information regarding the phase and polarization angle. In recent years, there has been a surge in research on polarization-sensitive photodetectors that utilize anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) materials. The essence of these 2D polarization-sensitive photodetectors is rooted in the anisotropic characteristics that arise from the asymmetric crystal lattice of the 2D materials in question. This anisotropy is manifested in both optical and electrical behaviors due to the asymmetrical nature of the crystal structure. This article systematically categorizes anisotropic 2D materials and offers an insightful overview of their crystal structures. It also introduces various optical and electrical characterization techniques designed to elucidate the anisotropic properties of these materials. The focus of the article then shifts to detailing the current state of research in the realm of anisotropic 2D material-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors. It provides a comprehensive description of the working principles behind polarization-sensitive photodetectors with different structural designs, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that enable their polarization sensitivity. In conclusion, the article summarizes the findings of this review, highlighting the advancements and challenges in the field.

  abstract = {Mnemonic networks are cyclic catalytic networks of monomeric enzymes that exhibit kinetic cooperativity as departures of the mean velocity from the hyperbolic, Michaelis–Menten-like response. In addition, such networks admit a hysteretic response when conformational fluctuations are slow compared to the catalytic rate. Here, we show how these fluctuation-driven effects emerge from the underlying stochasticity in the network. We use the chemical master equation to study the stochastic kinetics of mnemonic networks, which, in their minimal form, include a pair of conformers and triangular reaction pathways. We introduce statistical measures that are conditional on the turnovers to comprehensively analyze molecular fluctuations in the transient and stationary states of these networks. In the transient state, temporal correlations between enzyme turnovers lead to an inequivalence between number and temporal fluctuations, yielding a hysteretic response of the mean velocity to substrates. The transient relaxes to a stationary state with independent and identically distributed turnovers and equality between number and temporal fluctuations. This state is a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) when the Kolmogorov loop criterion is not satisfied, leading to the emergence of kinetic cooperativity. The symmetry of the number correlation functions allows us to distinguish between the absence of cooperativity in equilibrium and the accidental vanishing of cooperativity in a NESS. We conclude that memory and hysteresis are transient effects while kinetic cooperativity emerges as the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic irreversibility of the NESS in a network with cyclic reaction pathways.},

We used the helical rise and helical twist, as well as a newly defined helical diameter, to characterize the stretching and twisting of dsRNA. The results indicate that dsRNA unwinds when stretched, accompanied by a linear increase in helical rise and helical diameter. Then, we utilized the normal modes, which are linear combinations of helical modes, to elucidate the underlying mechanism of dsRNA unwinding from an energetic perspective. On the other hand, we employed a stiffness matrix based on a rigid base pair model to examine the base-pair dependence of twist elasticity for dsRNA, as well as stretch elasticities with respect to the helical rise and helical diameter. The results show that the force induces variations in the local elasticities and their couplings of dsRNA, which are closely related to the distributions of base pairs. The mean stretch and twist elasticities can be considered as constants within the measurement uncertainties; however, their couplings demonstrate a slight linear dependency on applied force.},

  abstract = {Dimerization and subsequent aggregation of polymers and biopolymers often occur under nonequilibrium conditions. When the initial state of the polymer is not collapsed, or the final folded native state, the dynamics of dimerization can follow a course sensitive to both the initial conditions and the conformational dynamics. Here, we study the dimerization process by using computer simulations and analytical theory, where the two monomeric polymer chains are in the elongated state and are initially placed at a separation distance, d 0 . Subsequent dynamics lead to the concurrent processes of collapse, dimerization, and/or escape. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model of the polymer to capture certain aspects of the dimerization process. At separations d 0 much shorter than the length of the monomeric polymer, the dimerization could happen fast and irreversibly from the partly extended polymer state itself. At an initial separation larger than a critical distance, d c , the polymer collapse precedes dimerization , and a significant number of single polymers do not dimerize within the time scale of simulations. To quantify these competitions, we introduce several time-dependent order parameters, namely, (i) the time-dependent radius of gyration R G ( t ) of individual polymers describing the conformational state of the polymer, (ii) a center-to-center of mass distance parameter R MM , and (iii) a time dependent overlap function Q ( t ) between the two monomeric polymers, mimicking the contact order parameter popular in protein folding. In order to better quantify the findings, we perform a theoretical analysis to capture the stochastic processes of collapse and dimerization by using the dynamical disorder model.},

  abstract = {Buoyancy-driven convection currents arise from temperature gradients in thermal frontal polymerization (FP) when the spatially localized polymerization reaction travels perpendicularly to the gravity field. We propose a theoretical study of the system dynamics under adiabatic conditions. The polymer and the reactant mixture are considered to be in the same liquid phase, but the viscosity can increase with the degree of polymerization. We find that the reaction zone propagates as a hot spot-like pattern with a broken symmetry in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Furthermore, the system can reach an asymptotic dynamics characterized by a front with a steady shape that propagates at constant speed with a steady vortex surrounding it. As the strength of the vortex is increased, either by decreasing the reactants’ viscosity or by increasing the layer’s thickness, we observe a transition between (i) a passive regime predicted by pure reaction–diffusion and hydrodynamic models and (ii) an active chemo-hydrodynamic regime where such models separately break down. In the active regime (ii), the front speed decreases as convection intensifies. By means of a scaling analysis, we explain how hydrodynamic currents might lower the velocity of a polymerization wave. As the viscosity of the polymer is enlarged, the flow is shifted ahead of the reaction zone and becomes more symmetrical with respect to the middle of the system, as recently observed in solid–liquid FP experiments [Y.

This new structure has been derived using an ab initio density functional theory methodology and focusing on the agreement between the experimental and theoretical x-ray diffraction patterns. An extensive study has been performed to analyze the possible conformations that the polymeric strand can adopt in its crystalline form, leading to 60 initial crystalline structures. Due to thermal motion, which cannot be easily tackled with the ab initio methodology, and small inaccuracies, which are intrinsic to this calculation method, the theoretical unit cell dimensions can slightly differ from those obtained in the crystallization experiments. Thus, a structural refinement method has been employed to overcome these discrepancies and procure a crystalline structure whose x-ray diffraction pattern is consistent with the experimental one. For the proposed crystalline structure of PBF, both the powder diffraction pattern and the fiber diffraction diagram show a remarkable agreement with those available in the literature.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase. Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.},

  abstract = {Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors have garnered significant attention due to their high power and energy densities, as well as the abundance of sodium reserves. However, the mismatch between anode and cathode dynamics is the biggest barrier to improving their performance. To address this issue, we propose a strategy for the preparation of porous MXene by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-controlled etching to solve the capacity degradation and ion diffusion limitation, which are caused by van der Waals forces between MXene nanosheets. This approach facilitates the realization of three-dimensional ion channels with both vertical and horizontal pathways, significantly enhancing the availability of active sites and improving the ion diffusion rate. By adjusting the amount of oxidant, porous MXene (P-MXene-2) with an optimal pore size range was obtained. The assembled half-cell has a capacity of 180 mAh g −1 at a rate of 0.05 A g −1 . Furthermore, by combining a porous carbon cathode with porous MXene and electrolyte screening, a SIHC with a high energy density of 110.6 Wh kg −1 at 1000 W kg −1 and 71.1 Wh kg −1 at 20 kW kg −1 was successfully constructed.

The key gas-sensing characteristics concerning chemiresistive (CR) and field-effect transistor (FET) gas sensing have been thoroughly explored. The results show that Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N can work as either CR or FET gas-sensing materials for detecting H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 O, whereas B-C 2 N can work as a disposable gas sensor for O 2 , H 2 O, and NH 3 . Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N are the most selective toward O 2 and NH 3 , followed by CO and H 2 O in an oxygen- and ammonia-free environment, while B-C 2 N is the most selective toward H 2 O and NH 3 . More importantly, the adsorption strength of target molecule plays a critical role in gas-sensing mechanism as well as selectivity, recovery time, and sensitivity. This study offers theoretical perspectives on 2D hybrid carbon-based nanomaterials for efficient gas sensing.},

Highly polarized spin probes were produced in situ by the addition of muonium to the aromatic anions, and the muon and methylene proton hyperfine coupling constants (hfccs) of these radical anions were determined from the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonance fields in the ALC- μ SR spectra. The motionally averaged dipolar muon hfccs, | D μ ‖ | ⁠ , were determined from the width and amplitude of the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonances and used to estimate the extent of reorientational motion. The results are consistent with the counterions being electrostatically trapped near the oil/water interface of the surfactant bilayer and undergoing large amplitude anisotropic motion. This motion is generally more restricted in DODMAC bilayers compared with DHTAC, which is likely related to the relative flexibility of the headgroups to which the counterions are loosely bound. The motion of the ortho isomers is generally more restricted than the para isomers, while there is no obvious trend regarding the ethyl, chloro, and hydroxy substituents.},

Model simulations using the density matrix method were performed to elucidate how the features of the magnetoluminescence effect depend on the triplet pair dynamics. Simulations of the observed field dependence of the magnetoluminescence effect revealed an anisotropy of 1:100 for the two-dimensional hopping of triplet excitons forming a triplet pair in the ab plane, for which the exchange interaction depends on the separation distance between the two triplet excitons.

By comparing the carrier dynamics taking place at the boundary and internal regions, we find that the benign shallow defect state in the grain boundary region has a positive effect on accelerating the cooling of hot carriers, while the deep energy level defects induce excited state absorption signals. This study provides a basis for further understanding the effect of grain boundary defects on the performance of polycrystal perovskite devices.},

  abstract = {Radical scavenging reaction rate constants were measured by monitoring the free induction decay (FID) of the unpaired electron of radicals by using laser-synchronized pulsed-EPR. This method probes large electron spin magnetization arisen from dynamic electron spin polarization (DEP), which remarkably enhances the EPR signal. DEP decays with the longitudinal spin relaxation time, which was observed by using the FID detection method. In the presence of a radical scavenger, the DEP decay time depends on both spin-lattice relaxation and the chemical reaction with the scavenger, the latter of which reduces radical concentration. The plots of DEP decay rates against the radical scavenger concentrations gave the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants for various radicals. This procedure was applied to determine the radical scavenging reaction rate constants of hydroxycyclohexyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, diphenylphosphinoyl, and α,α-dimethoxybenzyl radicals. The measured rate constants show good agreement with the previously reported values determined by using another method monitoring electron spin echo (ESE) decays of the radicals. We discussed the advantageous and disadvantageous characters of the FID detection method with respect to the existing ESE method in the viewpoints of signal intensity, selectivity of radicals, the simpleness of the measurements, and so on.},

  abstract = {In the present work, we investigate the thermal conductivity ( κ ) of different core–shell nanowires using molecular dynamics simulation and Green–Kubo (EMD), imposing a temperature gradient (NEMD) and Müller-Plathe (rNEMD) approaches. We show that in GaAs@InAs nanowires, the interface effect becomes more significant than the nanowire cross-sectional geometry. In particular, κ decreases as the interface area increases, reaching a minimum, and then increases when the interface strain relaxes. This is particularly important for thermoelectric applications, where minimization of κ is desired. In particular, the different methods can predict minima at different core diameters without special considerations. In addition, the NEMD approach and, to a lesser extent, rNEMD tend to overestimate the κ values, which cannot be corrected with the methods available in the literature. By analyzing the temperature and length dependence, (I) we show that interfacial scattering primarily involves phonon–phonon interactions, which mainly affect low-energy modes, a mechanism that effectively reduces κ at low temperatures. (II) The Langevin thermostat tends to pump low-energy modes in the NEMD approach, but this effect decreases with longer nanowires. (III) Energy exchanges in rNEMD stimulate high-energy phonons, derived from the saturation of κ at a much shorter nanowire length than NEMD. These findings highlight the challenges of accurately determining κ of ultrathin core–shell nanowires, where only the EMD approach provides precise results. With the recognition of non-equilibrium contributions to the overestimation of κ by NEMD and rNEMD, these methods can still provide valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying thermal transport mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We investigate fundamental aspects concerning selectivity in hydrogenation reactions for Solid Catalyst with Ionic Liquid Layer (SCILL)-type systems. Some of us recently reported that the adsorption behavior of 1,3-butadiene and 1-butene on Pt(111) can be tuned with ultrathin layers of the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 1 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]): Increasing the IL coverage leads to increased blocking of olefin adsorption sites. Notably, a smaller IL amount is needed to prevent 1-butene adsorption as compared to 1,3-butadiene adsorption, leading to a selectivity window, in which 1,3-butadiene still can be adsorbed while 1-butene cannot. With the aim to evaluate whether this is a general behavior, we study an IL with a longer alkyl chain at the cation, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]), and an IL with a different anion, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C 8 C 1 Im][PF 6 ]). Indeed, we observe a selectivity window for all ILs and thus demonstrate that this concept also applies for other ILs with different chain lengths and anions. Nevertheless, there are pronounced differences for the three ILs in terms of the IL coverages required for full blocking and the width of the selectivity window. Different explanations are discussed, e.g., the structure of the IL layer and the interaction strengths of olefins and ILs with the substrate.},

  abstract = {Aluminum (Al) is a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and low volume expansibility. However, scalable fabrication of nanostructured Al still faces a great challenge. In addition, the lithium storage performance of Al anode materials always encounters a severe strike within a dozen discharge/charge cycles, and such an abnormal behavior of the Al anode material remains enigmatic. Herein, a mechanochemistry method without using any solvent is developed to achieve scalable production of Al nanoparticles and the morphology of the obtained Al nanoparticles could be regulated using Ketjen black (KB). KB with a chain-like structure could regulate the Al crystal growth process and the aggregation of Al nanoparticles during the solid-phase reaction, shortening the electron transfer path among Al crystals, ultimately activating the lithium storage behavior of nanostructured Al. Initial discharge/charge capacities of 630.6 and 402.0 mA h g −1 were achieved at 50 mA g −1 ; unfortunately, the nanostructured Al still suffered from rapid deterioration of lithium storage performance. Comprehensive analysis demonstrated that the raised energy barrier of LiAl formation and the slow lithium diffusion kinetics in the Al matrix may be the main factors destroying the lithium storage performance of the Al anode material. This work provided more evidence for illustrating the lithium storage behavior of the Al anode.},

  abstract = {Quantifying thermodynamics, structural, and dynamical properties of brine confined in clay pores is critical for a variety of geo-energy applications, including underground hydrogen storage (UHS) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are applied here to study aqueous NaCl brines within 10-Å kaolinite slit pores. NaCl concentrations are chosen at 5, 10, 12.5, and 15 wt. %, all below the solubility limit and high enough to provide statistically relevant information. The distribution of the ions within the nanopores is found not to be homogeneous. Explicitly, Na + cations, preferentially attracted to the siloxane surface, accumulate in regions with low water density, whereas Cl − anions, attracted to the gibbsite surface of kaolinite, are found within the hydration layers. Confinement affects the properties of ions, with ion pairing being more pronounced within the pore than in bulk aqueous solutions at similar temperatures, pressures, and compositions. Conversely, the ions affect the properties of confined water. For example, the lifetime of water–water hydrogen bonds in confinement is shortened within the hydration shells; increasing salinity from 5 to 12.5 wt. % reduces the likelihood of water density fluctuations near the kaolinite surfaces, although when the NaCl concentration rises from 12.5 to 15 wt. %, Cl − anions enhance the likelihood of density fluctuations for the hydration layer near the gibbsite surface. The simulated molecular trajectories are studied further to extract diffusion coefficients. While confinement in the kaolinite nanopore reduces the mobility of all species, non-monotonic trends are observed as a function of salt concentration. The trends seem associated with the likelihood of ion pairing. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients for the cations are predicted to be higher than those for the anions, which is contrary to what is typically observed in bulk brines. Because density fluctuations are correlated with properties such as the solubility of gases in confined water, our observations may have important implications for geo-energy applications such as UHS and CCS.},

The traditional Boltzmann transport equation method is highly accurate but limited by the low-order phonon scattering model, which makes it difficult to resolve the high-order scattering effects of low symmetry layered materials. The classical molecular dynamics calculation is efficient but lacks accuracy due to the missing multi-component potential function. In this study, we develop a strategy to predict the thermal conductivity of K 0.8 Li 0.27 Ti 1.73 O 4 (KLTO), a model of layered oxides by machine-learning using a deep neural network model to acquire the interatomic potential of KLTO. The deep learning potential (DLP) is in excellent agreement with density functional theory in predicting atomic force, energy, and elastic properties. In addition, the calculated out-of-plane thermal conductivity values based on the DLP (0.37 W m −1 K −1 ) are close to experimental results (0.28 W m −1 K −1 ). This machine-learning framework for constructing interatomic potentials can be extended to other layered materials, offering a promising approach for advancing the theoretical study of such systems.},

  abstract = {Cyanogen chloride (CNCl) is a toxic chemical that poses significant risks to human health and the environment; therefore, its level must be accurately monitored. Herein, the adsorption of CNCl by transition metal-doped fluorinated diamanes (F-diamanes) has been extensively studied via first-principles calculations. Key parameters such as adsorption energies, charge transfer amounts, bandgaps, sensitivity, densities of states, projected density of states, charge density differences, and recovery time were systematically analyzed. Results reveal that monometallic doping significantly enhances CNCl adsorption, with increases in adsorption energy by 164%–368% and charge transfer by 1234%–1571%, particularly in the AuFD-CNCl, AgFD-CNCl, and CuFD-CNCl systems, which demonstrated improved sensing performances. Similarly, bimetallic co-doping further strengthened adsorption, with energy enhancements of 277%–309% and charge transfer increases of 1238%–1505%. Au-CuFD-CNCl, Au-AgFD-CNCl, and Cu-AgFD-CNCl systems also showed superior sensing performances. Meanwhile, the recovery time of CNCl molecules on the AuFD, AgFD, Au-CuFD, and Au-AgFD surfaces was drastically reduced to acceptable levels at 279–412 K, leading to their desorption. Therefore, these four systems exhibited excellent reversibility properties, suggesting their applicability in gas-sensing applications. This work can facilitate the applications of doped F-diamanes in environmental conservation, energy storage, and chemical engineering.},

  abstract = {In this study, a solution system of KCl–NH 4 Cl–NH 3 –H 2 O with different mass fractions was prepared at room temperature using x-ray scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. From x-ray scattering, it was obtained that the peak near Q = 2.50 Å −1 in the F ( Q ) function changed from a flat-topped blunt peak to a bimodal peak as the concentration of ammonia increased. This change indicated that increased ammonia altered the hydrogen bonding network within the mixed solution. In the G ( r ) function, the peak near 3.25 Å enhances with the increase in ammonia concentration, suggesting a higher occurrence of N(NH 4 + )–N(NH 3 ) interactions. Raman spectroscopy findings demonstrated that in the KCl–NH 4 Cl aqueous mixture, the area of DDAA-type hydrogen bonds increased as KCl concentration decreased and NH 4 Cl concentration increased. This suggests that KCl disrupts DDAA-type hydrogen bonds more significantly than NH 4 Cl. The situation was reversed when ammonia was added to the system, implying that KCl damages the DDAA-type hydrogen bonding structure less than NH 4 Cl when NH 3 is present in the solution. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the coordination number of K–Cl increases with ammonia concentration, as ammonia’s lone pair of electrons can bind to NH 4 + to stabilize the [NH 4 (H 2 O) m−n (NH 3 ) n ] + complex. This study elucidates the underlying microscopic mechanisms behind the decrease in KCl solubility and the increase in NH 4 Cl solubility upon increased ammonia.},

  abstract = {Two main frameworks are commonly used to describe electrolyte solutions: the non-primitive model, which rigorously accounts for all interactions between ions and solvent molecules; and the primitive model, which treats the solvent as a dielectric continuum, only describing ion–ion interactions explicitly. The primitive model offers simple Helmholtz energy expressions, including the Debye–Hückel (DH) equation, the primitive mean spherical approximation (MSA), and the Born theory of solvation. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of primitive model approaches by comparing their Helmholtz energies with data from molecular simulations obtained for non-primitive model electrolyte solutions. We model electrolyte solutions as mixtures of equally sized, charged, and (non-polarizable) dipolar Lennard-Jones particles. Using thermodynamic integration, we isolate the Helmholtz energy contributions related to solvent–solvent, ion–solvent, and ion–ion interactions. Molecular simulations are performed across two temperatures and two densities, a range of charges, dipole moments, and ion mole fractions (0.005 ≤ x ions ≤ 0.05). Our results show that while the primitive model expressions provide a qualitatively reasonable description of electrolyte solutions, they systematically underestimate the Helmholtz energy contributions associated with ion–solvent and ion–ion interactions. Achieving quantitative agreement requires empirical adjustments to the Born radius. Notably, the optimized Born radii are significantly larger than the actual ion sizes used in the molecular simulations, questioning the primitive model’s applicability. This work presents rigorous benchmarks for the use of MSA, DH, and Born theories, along with molecular simulation data for non-primitive model electrolytes. These benchmarks provide insights for refining existing models and advancing the development of new equations of state for electrolyte solutions.},

To advance the understanding of their melt processing and glass forming ability, we report the atomic structure of molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 over 1770–2630 K, which spans the equilibrium and supercooled liquid regimes. The melt density at T m = 2283 K is 5.50 g cm −3 , measured via silhouette imaging of electrostatically levitated drops over 1010–2420 K. Four separate structure measurements were made with aerodynamically levitated melts using x-ray and neutron diffraction with isotope substitution of Yb ( 172 Yb, 174 Yb, or nat Yb). Empirical potential structure refinement models were developed, which are in excellent agreement with the experiments. Coordination environments for Al–O are predominantly 4- and 5-coordinate, with a mean coordination of n AlO = 4.43(8), while Yb–O environments mostly range from 5- to 8-coordinate, with n YbO = 6.26(8). The cation–oxygen polyhedra are connected primarily by corner-sharing, with edge-sharing constituting up to ∼1/3 of the connectivity among polyhedra with Yb or higher-coordinated Al–O. Structurally, the –Al–O– network in molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 appears conducive to glass formation: n OAl = 1.85(3), there are 1.86 AlO x –AlO x connections per Al atom (e.g., a mixture of Q 3 and Q 4 units), and the modal ring size is six cations. These characterize a network that is somewhat less constrained compared to SiO 2 glass, yet Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 cannot be quenched into crystal-free glass. Aluminum garnet compositions with larger rare earth cations do form glass, so these characterizations help reveal the structural characteristics corresponding to the limit of glass forming ability in rare earth aluminates.},

Using orbitals from Hartree–Fock (HF) and density functional theory calculations, FN-DMC with the frozen-core approximation yields correlation energies consistent with CCSD(T) and ph-AFQMC, while all-electron FN-DMC lowers the correlation energy by ∼0.27 a.u., highlighting the role of core-electron contributions. On average, all-electron FN-DMC predicts vertical [VIP: 0.3477(34) a.u.] and adiabatic [AIP: 0.3433(39) a.u.] ionization potentials, both slightly above the experimental value [0.339 70(2) a.u.]. Zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) corrections adjust the VIP and AIP by −0.012 and +0.0037 a.u., respectively, improving agreement with experiment. Compared to HF, FN-DMC incorporates an additional 0.055 a.u. ( ⁠ ≈ 1.5 eV) of correlation energy into the IP, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing electron correlation in aromatic systems.},

  abstract = {The incorporation of Ag atoms into ligand-protected gold nanoclusters is an effective way to tune their properties for applications in optics, electronics, and catalysis. However, the precise identification of preferred doping sites is challenging owing to its high structural complexity, which hinders establishing the structure–activity relationship. Here, through density functional theory calculations coupled with energy evaluation, delicate structural analysis, valence electron counting, and localized molecular orbital topology, we characterize the tetrahedral Au 3 Ag with closed-shell two valence electrons [Au 3 Ag(2 e )] as a fundamental building block in face-centered-cubic (FCC) ligand-protected AuAg (LP-AuAg) alloy nanoclusters. The kernel structures of FCC LP-AuAg alloy clusters are constructed by rational spatial packing of Au 3 Ag(2 e ), Au 4 (2 e ), and Au 3 (2 e ) blocks, aligning with the grand unified model of ligand-protected Au nanoclusters. In addition, we predict 40 FCC LP-AuAg alloy nanoclusters with 141 low-energy isomers. This work underscores the crucial role of subset blocks in stabilizing the entire cluster and provides valuable insights into the structural features of FCC LP-AuAg alloy clusters.},

A comprehensive study with two excitation wavelengths and a broadband white-light continuum probe (400–1400 nm) has determined that a torsional isomerization mechanism is the most probable for both isomers. This has shed light on the excited state behavior of the elusive push–pull Z isomer, which has its properties mostly predicted by simulations and systematically lacks experimental observations. Meanwhile, another unproductive relaxation pathway, associated with a symmetric bending motion, was found only for the E isomer. When relaxing through this pathway, the molecule encounters a potential barrier in the ground state, which requires significant structural reorganization before full relaxation. This local minimum can be more general than expected and may be behind unsolved issues in the literature of azobenzenes.},

  abstract = {An uncertainty-driven active learning strategy was employed to achieve efficient point sampling for full-dimension potential energy surface constructions. Model uncertainty is defined as the weighted square energy difference between two neural network models, and the local maximums of uncertainty would be added to the training set by two criteria. A two-step sampling procedure was introduced to reduce the computational costs of expansive double-precision neural network training. A reference potential energy surface (PES) of the 6-D H 2 O–He system was constructed first by the MLRNet model with a weighted Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.028 cm −1 . The full-dimension long-range function was fitted by a pruned basis expansion method. The current sampling method is reliable for the long-range switched fundamental invariant neural network (LS-FI-NN) to construct spectroscopically accurate PES, where the single precision model achieves a test set RMSE of 0.3253 cm −1 with 472 fitting points and the double precision model is 0.0710 cm −1 with only 613 points. In comparison, the MLRNet requires 652 points to reach a similar accuracy. However, the MLRNet, with fewer parameters, shows lower training errors across all sampling cycles and lower test errors in the first few cycles, indicating its potential with an appropriate sampling procedure. The spectroscopic calculations were performed to validate the accuracy of PESs. The energy levels of the double precision LS-FI-NN showed great agreement with the reference PES’s results, with only 0.0161 and 0.0044 cm −1 average errors for vibrational levels and the band origin shifts.},

The results show that the initial velocity of the droplets significantly influences the coalescence time and jumping characteristics. As the initial velocity increases, the coalescence time decreases, and the horizontal velocity increases, suggesting that controlling the initial velocity can adjust droplet motion behavior. In terms of energy conversion, the total energy conversion rate remains relatively constant at lower initial velocities but increases significantly as the velocity rises. This is primarily due to the reduced coalescence time and viscous dissipation caused by the increased initial kinetic energy, allowing more energy to be converted into the kinetic energy of jumping. The energy conversion rate in the horizontal direction increases with initial velocity, while in the vertical direction, it tends to decrease. This study deepens the understanding of coalescence-induced jumping phenomena at the nanoscale and provides a theoretical basis for engineering applications, showing that droplet behavior can be effectively modulated by controlling the initial velocity.},

We compare our theoretical predictions with pump–probe experiments on iodomethane and bromoiodomethane. Our theory successfully predicts the two reaction channels in iodomethane photodissociation that lead to I ( P 3 / 2 2 ) and I * ( P 1 / 2 2 ) products, showing excellent agreement with experimental delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals at large pump–probe delays. The theoretical kinetic energy release at small delays depends significantly on the choice of ionic states. By accounting for internal rotation, the kinetic energies of individual fragments in bromoiodomethane align well with experimental results. Furthermore, our theory confirms that two-fragment Coulomb explosion imaging cannot resolve different spin channels in bromoiodomethane photodissociation.},

  abstract = {Area-selective atomic layer deposition (area-selective ALD) has been extensively studied because of its versatility in nanotechnological applications. The priority focus in area-selective ALD is to achieve the desired selectivity; thus, most studies to date have been concentrated on the reaction mechanism of ALD on growth/nongrowth substrates or the development of novel methodologies to resolve the challenges associated with its implementation in high-volume manufacturing. In this study, we performed area-selective ALD of SiO 2 on SiO 2 , where SiO 2 was not grown on SiN x , and suggested area-selective ALD approaches that could simultaneously enhance selectivity and film quality. An NH 3 plasma treatment was applied to functionalize the SiN x surface with more Si–NH bonds, which exhibited low reactivity toward Si precursors. Although the SiO 2 surface was also functionalized with Si–NH bonds, it was not fully converted into Si–NH because of its thermodynamic nature at low temperatures. Consequently, the results showed that NH 3 plasma pretreatment was effective in increasing selectivity. Therefore, we performed a layer-by-layer NH 3 plasma treatment during the ALD of SiO 2 to deposit high-quality films without losing selectivity. The SiO 2 film was densified, as confirmed by x-ray reflection spectra without nitrogen impurity incorporation. Electrical property measurements of metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors confirmed that this approach enabled simultaneous selectivity and SiO 2 film-quality enhancement.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction almost three decades ago, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has evolved into a mature and powerful technique to reveal the inner workings of quantum systems with high temporal and spectral resolution. In general, this technique can isolate different contributions to the nonlinear response and provides access to different dynamical quantum pathways of the system evolution. Such isolation of pathways can be achieved in different experimental geometries. In its original, fully noncollinear implementation, directional phase matching allows for such signal isolation, while in the modern commonly employed pump–probe geometry, experimentally challenging phase-cycling schemes are employed. Here, we show how rephasing, non-rephasing, and zero- and double-quantum 2DES signals can be isolated in the pump–probe geometry without a need for phase-cycling. For this, we utilize established causality restrictions of the nonlinear response, allowing us to separate the different contributions in the spectral domain. We demonstrate this using data recorded for a molecular J-aggregate, acting as an effective three-level system. This approach bridges the gap between the capabilities of shaper-based and fully noncollinear 2DES and experimentally simpler implementations, such as those based on birefringent common-path interferometers.},

Our method can access nucleation rates up to 50 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported results. We examine three cases: homogeneous pure system, system with static impurities, and system with mobile impurities, where impurities are defined as sites with zero interactions with neighboring spins (the spin value of impurities is set to 0). Classical nucleation theory holds across the entire temperature range studied in the paper, for both the homogeneous system and the static impurity case. However, in the case of mobile impurities, the umbrella sampling technique appears ineffective at low mobility values.

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In Paper I [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in Paper II [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.},

In the process, this paper categorizes models of external perturbations in molecular dynamics as either responsive—i.e., perturbations that impose a force—or directive—i.e., perturbations that impose a trajectory. Since directive perturbations have not been studied enough in the literature but are becoming more relevant, their effects on simple perturbed thermostatted systems are considered. Finally, using a perturbed two-point harmonic oscillator as well as a driven particle immersed in a simple Lennard-Jones fluid, it gives an approximation for the limit of justified equilibrium thermostat use for perturbed systems. This paper hopes to inspire further research in the fields of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {Iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles have been extensively studied as T 2 contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. The theory of nuclear magnetic relaxation induced by superparamagnetic nanoparticles has been validated by numerous experimental studies in the case of spherical particles. Recently, several studies focused on the synthesis of cubic nanoparticles. Some of them reported significantly higher relaxivities compared to their spherical counterpart and attributed this increase to their specific shapes. This work investigates the impact of cube-shaped nanoparticles on nuclear magnetic relaxation through Monte Carlo methods. Transverse relaxation at high static magnetic field is simulated by modeling the proton diffusion in the magnetic field generated by a cubic or a spherical nanoparticle. The results indicate that, in the case of magnetite nanoparticles, there is no significant difference between both shapes for sizes above 30 nm when particles are compared at equal volumes and magnetization. Below this size, a −40%–15% variation of the relaxation rates is predicted for the cubic case compared to the spherical case. These results are explained using general relaxation models that incorporate the distribution of the magnetic field generated by the nanoparticles. The simulation predictions are compared to some experimental results from the literature, revealing that, in some cases, the magnetic field specific to the nanoparticle shape alone cannot explain the observed increase in the relaxation rate of cubic nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Gas diffusion in graphene nanochannels is pivotal for applications such as gas sensing and membrane separation, where nanoscale confinement introduces unique transport phenomena. Unlike bulk-phases, diffusion in graphene nanochannels is significantly influenced by adsorption, which modifies density distributions and alters diffusivity behavior. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are combined with a theoretical framework to comprehensively investigate gas diffusion under varying pressures and channel heights. A modified Chapman–Enskog model, derived from atomistic Lennard-Jones potential parameters, is proposed to account for the effects of confinement. Simulation results reveal that gas diffusivity decreases with increasing gas-phase pressure and decreasing channel height due to enhanced density in the nanochannels. Interestingly, for ultra-narrow channels ( h ≲ 0.7 nm), the diffusivity correction factor exhibits non-monotonic behavior, initially decreasing but subsequently increasing due to overlapping repulsive potential fields. The proposed model integrates adsorption effects through density predictions based on the Boltzmann distribution and effectively predicts gas diffusivities with relative errors of less than 13%, even under strong confinement. These findings highlight the critical interplay between adsorption and confinement in shaping gas transport within graphene nanochannels. The theoretical model provides a predictive tool for designing graphene-based gas separation and sensing devices, offering fundamental insights for optimizing their performance.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer processes are ubiquitous in nature and intensely investigated. The investigations concentrate on the transfer of small to intermediate sized energies. Here, we pose the question of whether the transfer of large energies, where relativistic effects play a central role, can be efficient. At large energies, the process leads to ionization of the environment, i.e., it is the interatomic (or intermolecular) Coulombic decay (ICD) process. To that end, we derive asymptotic expressions for the ICD amplitude by employing the Dirac–Breit Hamiltonian and expanding the frequency dependent Coulomb–Breit interaction between the electrons of the donor and those of the acceptor in powers of the inverse distance between their centers of mass. Expressions are separately derived for the two popular Feynman and Coulomb gauges. At long range, the two expressions have a different appearance but are proven to be equivalent. The derived energy transfer rate at long range shows that when the donor is embedded in an environment, the transfer can be highly efficient. A key is that the radiative lifetime of the donor is extremely short (it can be in the attosecond, 10 −18 s, regime), and the x-ray emission typically dominates by far Auger decay (also called Auger–Meitner decay), and the ICD can quench this emission. This contrasts with the situation at small to intermediate sized energies, where the radiative lifetime is much smaller and Auger decay (if the channel is open) dominates. In these cases, the major contribution to ICD comes from the neighbors nearby.},

  abstract = {Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations, provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size, making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl 3 in water.},

To test the reliability of the theoretical development, we form three sets of non-covalent complexes from the literature with a total of fifty-one systems. The former set of complexes includes many different types of non-covalent interactions, the second set consists of prototypical non-covalent complexes and three biologically relevant interactions between DNA base pairs, and the third set comprises halogen bonding complexes. We determined the charge-transfer energy contributions and the total interaction energies of all these complexes. The calculated charge-transfer energies are in very good agreement with the ones calculated using the fragment-based Hirshfeld methodology, which has been proven to be reliable.

  abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell–Schrödinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. In addition, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach—an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using simple dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.},

  abstract = {Introducing heavy atoms, or replacing atoms with heavier ones, is a routine approach for accelerating spin-flipping photophysical processes. However, predicting its impact on phosphorescence efficiency is not straightforward. Herein, we report an unexpected consequence of bromine-to-iodine substitution in a bromothienyl diketone derivative, TIPS-BrTn , that exhibits outstanding room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in cyclohexane solution. Contrary to our expectation, the iodo-congener TIPS-ITn exhibited feeble photoluminescence, which we confirmed as RTP by ultrafast spectroscopy. Further experimental and theoretical studies revealed that, in the T 1 state, an excited-state symmetry breaking occurred on TIPS-ITn while TIPS-BrTn preserved the centrosymmetric geometry. We identified the driving force for the symmetry breaking as an intramolecular two-center three-electron bonding interaction between iodine and carbonyl oxygen in the (n,π*) excited state. Consequently, while the direct T 1 –S 0 spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in TIPS-BrTn is symmetry-forbidden and zero, that of TIPS-ITn is non-zero due to the loss of centrosymmetry, thereby accelerating nonradiative T 1 –S 0 decay to diminish the RTP. Importantly, the phosphorescence rate constant is not solely dictated by the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC; instead, it can be rationalized by the intensity borrowing from higher singlet states. Thus, our work highlights the importance of controlling molecular symmetry, which could suppress the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC and lead to a preferential acceleration of radiative decay over nonradiative decay for achieving efficient RTP.},

Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. In addition, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules.

More precisely, when a given Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with the unknown integrable potential interacts with δ -function potentials, we obtain a family of perturbation problems, called point interaction models in quantum mechanics. Then, only depending on the first eigenvalues of these perturbed problems, we define and study the first eigenvalue function , by which the desired potential can be expressed explicitly and uniquely. As by-products, using the analytic function theoretic tools, we also generalize several fundamental theorems of classical Sturm-Liouville problems to measure differential equations with non-trivial positive integrable weights, which provide the possibility of the further study of inverse spectral problems for more general measure differential equations.},

The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield Tsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when q is interpreted as an entropic parameter. Furthermore, higher-order expansion coefficients naturally introduce new divergence measures, extending Tsallis relative entropy through a one-parameter generalisation.

We obtain two sets of results. First, we use strong Whitney topologies on spaces of Lorentzian metrics on a manifold M , in the spirit of Lerner’s [Commun. Math. Phys. 32 , 19 (1973)], and obtain that while the set of singular Lorentzian metrics around a fiducial one possessing a weakly trapped submanifold Σ is not really generic, it is nevertheless prevalent in a sense we define, and thus still quite “large” in this sense. We prove versions of that result both for the case when Σ has codimension 2, and for the case of higher codimension. The second set of results explore a similar question, but now for initial data sets containing marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS). For this case, we use certain well-known infinite dimensional, Hilbert manifold structures on the space of initial data and use abstract functional-analytic methods based on the work of Biliotti, Javaloyes, and Piccione’s [Indiana Univ.

The idea is to first define an “elementary” channel Φ 2 and then to analyze when Φ Φ 2 − 1 is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way—which even yields an explicit factorization of Φ—is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors x , x ⊥ such that 〈 x ⊥ | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = 〈 x | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = { 0 } where K Φ is the Kraus subspace of Φ and K Φ ⊥ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application—if possible—results in a factorization of Φ into in some sense “simple” channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.},

  abstract     = {The non-commutative harmonic oscillators Q α β NH with parameters α , β &gt; 0, αβ &gt; 1 and two-photon quantum Rabi models H △ , g 2 p with △ ≥ 0, | g | &lt; 1 2 are both extensions of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. In the special case where α = β and △ = 0, it is immediately seen that Q α α NH is unitarily equivalent to α 2 − 1 1 − 4 g 2 H 0 , g 2 p ⁠ . The purpose of this paper is to establish relationships between Q α β NH and H △ , g 2 p for the general cases △ &gt; 0 and α ≠ β , and to show the fiber decomposition of Q α β NH in terms of H △ , g 2 p ⁠ . We also construct Feynman–Kac formulas for e − t H △ , g 2 p and e − t Q α β NH ⁠ . It is then considered the asymptotic behaviors of the spectral zeta function ζ 2p ( s ) of H △ , g 2 p ⁠ .},

In this paper, we study the non–Abelian vortices in a quantum field theory which is the two–dimensions non–Abelian vortex zeromodes coupled to the massless four–dimensions Yang–Mills modes. We establish the existence and uniqueness for vortex solutions by researching the nonlinear elliptic equations systems with exponential terms in R 2 using the calculus of variations. In addition, the asymptotic behavior of the solutions at infinity and the quantized integrals in R 2 are obtained.},

First we prove there exists a unique solution for this equation by using a truncation method. Then, we establish the tightness of a family of probability distributions of solutions and obtain the existence of invariant measures by introducing an appropriate Lyapunov function and utilizing a decomposition approach. Finally, the regularity of the invariant measure is investigated, that is, the invariant measure is supported by a regular space.},
