  abstract     = {This paper proposes a real-size, single-shot, high-speed, and energy-efficient tensorized optical multimodal fusion network (TOMFuN) on an electro-photonic large-scale III–V-on-Si in-memory compute engine. The TOMFuN architecture leverages a memory-efficient and low-complexity self-attention for the embedding network for the text information and tensor-train and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decompositions for compressing the model parameters in the large-scale fully connected layers. Compared to full-size counterparts, our proposed network maintains a compatible inference accuracy in multimodal sentiment analysis tasks while requiring 92.8× fewer model parameters and 51.3× fewer hardware resources. Furthermore, the impact of photonic device imperfections on the TOMFuN architecture is investigated. The simulation results show that noise-aware on-chip training exhibits superior robustness. Finally, chip performance analysis shows that our TOMFuN inference accelerator has 230.73 PetaOps computational speed, 6.51 TOPS/W power efficiency, and 2.7 µ s latency with the input dimensions of 1024.},

The spatial distribution of the crystalline phase of an HZO film reveals that the tetragonal phase is a dominant crystal structure in the HZO film with [Zr] = 75%, resulting in anti-ferroelectric (AFE)-like double polarization switching. Analyses using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) find that the AFE-HZO capacitor effectively transforms the 3-bit time-series input into eight different reservoir output states. In reservoir computing tasks, the AFE-HZO capacitor with [Zr] = 75% achieves improved computational capacities compared with the other MFM capacitors with [Zr] = 0% and 50%. The AFE-HZO capacitor can effectively diversify time-series input signals through dynamic double polarization switching, leading to a more sub-divided and dispersive weight distribution across the adjustable weights in the readout part of our RC system.},

These resistance changes can remain for very long times or relax after a short time. Thus, memristors can be used as electronic synapses and neurons in artificial neural networks implemented in hardware. These fully memristive neuromorphic circuits are mainly intended for artificial intelligence applications. In this work, we explore the properties of a stochastic compact model for the electrical behavior of memristors in the two regimes of long-time (non-volatile) and short-time (volatile) memory for synapse and neuron functions, respectively. In the case of non-volatile memristors, we focus on potentiation/depression transients, programming energy, programming time, and power requirements for writing conductance weights in artificial network crossbars. As for volatile memristors, we consider the modeling of their behavior in the context of a leaky-integrate-and-fire neuron, demonstrating how the model captures the threshold activation function and the input signal frequency dependence.},

However, a large body of natural phenomena incorporates memory effects that are best described via fractional integro-differential equations (FIDEs), in which the integral or differential operators accept non-integer orders. Addressing the challenges posed by nonlinear FIDEs is a recognized difficulty, necessitating the application of generic methods with immediate practical relevance. This work introduces the Universal Fractional Integro-Differential Equations Solver (UniFIDES), a comprehensive machine learning platform designed to expeditiously solve a variety of FIDEs in both forward and inverse directions, without the need for ad hoc manipulation of the equations. The effectiveness of UniFIDES is demonstrated through a collection of integer-order and fractional problems in science and engineering. Our results highlight UniFIDES’ ability to accurately solve a wide spectrum of integro-differential equations and offer the prospect of using machine learning platforms universally for discovering and describing dynamic and complex systems.},

These limitations include increased leakage currents, pronounced short-channel effects, and quantum tunneling through the gate oxide, leading to higher power consumption and deviations from ideal behavior. Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) can overcome these challenges by utilizing the quantum tunneling of charge carriers to switch between on and off states and achieve a subthreshold swing below 60 mV/decade. This allows for lower power consumption, continued scaling, and improved performance in low-power applications. This review focuses on the design and operation of TFETs, emphasizing the optimization of device performance through material selection and advanced simulation techniques. The discussion will specifically address the use of two-dimensional materials in TFET design and explore simulation methods ranging from multi-scale approaches to machine learning-driven optimization.},

Machine learning has been actively explored as a means to this end; however, challenges remain in terms of versatility for different tasks and device types. In this study, we explore a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach: unlike traditional reinforcement learning techniques, the learning process of MBRL progresses by constructing a model for the environment, which is to be diverted for other tasks and/or devices, thereby minimizing time-consuming learning processes. Using pre-measured data, we construct an environment model and, despite the intrinsic sparse reward distribution of the QD system, demonstrate its suitability for MBRL by emulating the process of auto-tuning to a single QD region. Our results highlight the potential of MBRL for more generic QD auto-tuning techniques, providing a promising step toward fully automated QD tuning.},

  abstract     = {Identifying reaction coordinates (RCs) is a key to understanding the mechanism of reactions in complex systems. Deep neural network (DNN) and machine learning approaches have become a powerful tool to find the RC. On the other hand, the hyperparameters that determine the DNN model structure can be highly flexible and are often selected intuitively and in a non-trivial and tedious manner. Furthermore, how the hyperparameter choice affects the RC quality remains obscure. Here, we explore the hyperparameter space by developing the hyperparameter tuning approach for the DNN model for RC and investigate how the parameter set affects the RC quality. The DNN model is built to predict the committor along the RC from various collective variables by minimizing the cross-entropy function; the hyperparameters are automatically determined using the Bayesian optimization method. The approach is applied to study the isomerization of alanine dipeptide in vacuum and in water, and the features that characterize the RC are extracted using the explainable AI (XAI) tools. The results show that the DNN models with diverse structures can describe the RC with similar accuracy, and furthermore, the features analyzed by XAI are highly similar. This indicates that the hyperparameter space is multimodal. The electrostatic potential from the solvent to the hydrogen H 18 plays an important role in the RC in water. The current study shows that the structure of the DNN models can be rather flexible, while the suitably optimized models share the same features; therefore, a common mechanism from the RC can be extracted.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, data-driven deep learning models have gained significant importance in the analysis of turbulent dynamical systems. Within the context of reduced-order models, convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) pose a universally applicable alternative to conventional approaches. They can learn nonlinear transformations directly from data, without prior knowledge of the system. However, the features generated by such models lack interpretability. Thus, the resulting model is a black-box that effectively reduces the complexity of the system but does not provide insights into the meaning of the latent features. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel interpretable CAE approach for high-dimensional fluid flow data that maintains the reconstruction quality of conventional CAEs and allows for feature interpretation. Our method can be easily integrated into any existing CAE architecture with minor modifications of the training process. We compare our approach to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two existing methods for interpretable CAEs. We apply all methods to three different experimental turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection datasets with varying complexity. Our results show that the proposed method is lightweight, easy to train, and achieves relative reconstruction performance improvements of up to 6.4% over POD for 64 modes. The relative improvement increases to up to 229.8% as the number of modes decreases. In addition, our method delivers interpretable features similar to those of POD and is significantly less resource-intensive than existing CAE approaches, using less than 2% of the parameters. These approaches either trade interpretability for reconstruction performance or only provide interpretability to a limited extent.},

By incorporating the scattering physics of x rays into the network, SAXSNN could be trained to capture the complex mapping between the SAXS patterns in reciprocal space and the corresponding morphologies in real space in an unsupervised way. We demonstrated the performance of SAXSNN on the experimental SAXS patterns of semicrystalline and amorphous polymers, i.e., hard-elastic isotactic polypropylene (iPP) films and plasticized poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB). The morphologies reconstructed by SAXSNN are well consistent with our existing knowledge of the morphology of iPP films and PVB. The developed methodology here allows us to rapidly predict the morphologies for any given SAXS pattern without any in-prior phase information and, thus, provides an intuitive understanding of the microstructures of the measured samples. A real-time feedback of the morphologies of measured samples to SAXS beamline users at modern synchrotron radiation light sources will be feasible in the near future.},

  abstract     = {In materials informatics, feature selection and model selection are utilized in the knowledge extraction process, and the confidence evaluation of the selection result is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the extracted knowledge. In this study, we propose a novel method to quantitatively evaluate the significance of low-dimensional models obtained from an expanded feature space using the density of states (DoS) for the evaluation metrics. This method allows us to compare the performance of the selected model to those of other models and evaluate its significance. We further propose an evaluation method for feature importance based on marginal posterior probabilities using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) framework, which considers all models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through their application to a crystal structure dataset. Our results show that the DoS analysis reveals the presence of a large number of models with a comparable performance with the best model reported in a previous research work. This suggests that knowledge extracted from a single selected model can be unreliable and that considering other models is crucial. We also show that the BMA-based feature importance evaluation provides valuable insights into the importance of features, highlighting both primary features and functional forms. In addition, we demonstrate that the LASSO + L0 method commonly used in existing research deteriorates the search space for model selection. Our findings suggest that our proposed methods provide valuable tools for assessing the significance of low-dimensional models and extracting knowledge from large-scale data in materials informatics.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement—so-called entanglement engineering—for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon–phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.},

This model extends previous work on the U-net model. Here we trained binary-, three-, and five-class models using supervised learning on experimentally measured dynamic fracture experiments on various opaque structural ceramic materials that were adhered on transparent polymer (polycarbonate or acrylic) backing materials. Full details of the experimental investigations are outside the scope of this manuscript, but briefly, several different ceramics were loaded using spatially and time-varying mechanical loads to induce inelastic deformation and fracture processes that were recorded at frequencies as high as 5 MHz using high-speed optical imaging. These experiments provided a rich and diverse dataset that includes many of the common fracture modes found in static and dynamic fractures, including cone cracking, median cracking, comminution, and combined complex failure modes that involve effectively simultaneous activation and propagation of multiple fragmentation modes. While the training data presented here were obtained from dynamic fragmentation experiments, this study is applicable to static loading of these materials as the crack speeds are on the order of 1–10 km/s regardless of the loading rate. We believe the methodologies presented here will be useful in quantifying the failure processes in structural materials for protection applications and can be used for direct validation of engineering models used in design.},

RhoB, a key biomarker assessed via immunohistochemistry, is crucial in predicting responses to radiotherapy (RT), but variability in staining techniques and tumor heterogeneity often complicate these assessments. SRGNet integrates spatial statistics, nonlinear dynamics, graph theory, and graph convolutional networks to address these challenges. In testing, SRGNet outperformed 10 pre-trained convolutional neural networks, achieving 88% accuracy in biopsies from RT patients, with 67% accuracy for predicting survival under five years and 100% accuracy for survival over five years, along with 100% precision, an F1 score of 0.80, and an AUC of 0.73. For non-RT patients, SRGNet attained 91% accuracy, 100% precision for survival over five years, an F1 score of 0.86, and an AUC of 0.82. These results demonstrate SRGNet’s potential to enhance the precision and reliability of survival predictions in rectal cancer patients, overcoming challenges of RhoB expression variability and tumor heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional autoencoders have proven to be an adequate tool to perform reduced-order modeling for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. Their goal is to reduce dimensionality strongly while preserving the most characteristic features of the system. Here, we show that these models rely sensitively on the completeness of the provided data. This is particularly challenging for fully turbulent flows with their coherent structures ranging from large-scale superstructures to dissipative eddies over orders of magnitude in time and space. As a result, an unrealistically large number of data snapshots would be required to properly cover all the essential dynamics, whereas the features on small time and length scales require only a small number of snapshots of the respective flow, especially the long lasting large-scale structures that are difficult to characterize either numerically or experimentally. We demonstrate for three types of flows that a missing representation of large-scale turbulent structures leads to failures in the training process. We suggest a method to mitigate this shortcoming. This includes the transformation of data samples to new large-scale structures, which enhance the data. Furthermore, we skip augmentations that are more detrimental to the model performance. We evaluate our method for three datasets, two from numerical simulations of turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection flows and one from laboratory experiment for the flow past an array of cylinders. We show that the method can substantially improve model utility for high-dimensional data. In this way, we avoid an intensive grid search through possible augmentation combinations without further knowledge about the underlying system.},

  abstract     = {This research offers a new analytical tool that unravels the nonlinear relation between the parameters of Viscoelastic Damping (VD) and the resulting frequency spectrum in musical membranes. Understanding how variations in VD parameters influence the resulting sounds is crucial for developing new tools for artistic expression and for designing musical instruments with distinct sound qualities. In the case of membranophones, the external damping is well understood, while the internal damping due to viscoelastic properties of materials remains unclear. In previous research, VD in musical membranes has been modeled using a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) model. Nonetheless, analyzing the complex relationships between the large parameter space of the model and the nonlinear behavior of VD is a challenging task. This study addresses this analysis through physics-based machine learning. We employed a FDTD model of a viscoelastically damped membrane to create a physics-informed dataset, which we subsequently analyzed using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). Our findings reveal that the damping coefficient is the primary criterion when clustering the data. Furthermore, we found the internal structure of the cluster to depend on the rate of decay of the memory effect, i.e., the rate at which the energy introduced back into the system decreases. The study also demonstrates the benefits of using principal component analysis for the SOM initialization.},

Despite this growing array of options, the field of nanophotonic inverse design continues to rely heavily on quasi-Newton optimizers such as L-BFGS and basic momentum-based methods such as Adam. A systematic survey of these and other algorithms in the nanophotonics context remains lacking. Here, we compare 24 widely used machine learning optimizers on inverse design tasks. We study two prototypical nanophotonics inverse design problems—the mode splitter and wavelength demultiplexer—across various system sizes, using both hand-tuned and meta-learned hyperparameters. We find that Adam derivatives, as well as the Fromage optimizer, consistently outperform L-BFGS and standard gradient descent, regardless of system size. While meta-learning has a negligible-to-negative impact on Adam and Fromage, it significantly improves others, particularly AdaGrad derivatives and simple gradient descent, such that their performance is on par with Adam. In addition, we observe that the most effective optimizers exhibit the lowest correlation between initial and final performance. Our results and codebase (github.com/Ma-Lab-Cal/photonicsOptComp) provide a valuable framework for selecting and benchmarking optimizers in nanophotonic inverse design.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite materials have been extensively studied in the field of solar cells, and inorganic perovskites, with their good environmental and radiation stability, high defect tolerance, and high carrier mobility, also have great potential for betavoltaic batteries. In this study, we analyze the potential of all-inorganic perovskite betavoltaic batteries. The metal electrode commonly used in perovskite cell devices, such as Au, has a large effect on β particle incidence. MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) have excellent electrical conductivity, while their loose and porous structure reduces the effect on β particle incidence, which is an ideal electrode for betavoltaic nuclear batteries. Therefore, we propose the FTO/TiO 2 /CsPbBr 3 /NiO x /MWCNT structure and explore the prospects of CsPbBr 3 in betavoltaic batteries through simulations and experiments. The simulation results in an open-circuit voltage (V o c ) of 0.53 V, a short-circuit current (J s c ) of 21.53 nA cm −2 , a maximum output power (P m ) of 9.05 nW cm −2 , and a conversion efficiency ( ⁠ η ⁠ ) of 2.9%. The experimentally obtained V o c is 0.42 V, J s c is 12.22 nA cm −2 , P m is 2.55 nW cm −2 , and η is 0.8%. This points to the great potential of all-inorganic perovskite materials for betavoltaic batteries.},

  abstract     = {The spectral recognition is key for efficient machine vision to obtain high imaging quality of color target objects. However, the bidirectional response within a single band of vision sensors is still challenging to in-site recognize color target objects from a multi-spectral context. Here, inspired by avian eyes, we propose a tetrachromatic-bidirectional synaptic transistor based on WOx/WSe 2 heterojunctions with a ultraviolet (UV)-photoactive floating gate of CdS and realize the bio-avian vision with enhanced image and improved recognition under a multi-spectral background. The positive-synaptic responses are exhibited within the visible wavelength band while the negative response is for the UV wavelength band. Moreover, the bionic-kestrel vision behaviors are exhibited, such as the in-site enhanced color object images and the improved recognition accuracy from 58% to 93.1% due to the contribution of UV negative response. This work provides an effective neuromorphic vision to recognize the feature signatures from the multi-spectral contexts.},

We uncover the existence of the hidden symmetry and unearth the topology for the origin of chiral edge state pairs using winding number of a subspace Hamiltonian. The measured dispersion and localization of sound on the edges verify the observations in theory and simulations.

Spin–orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interaction induce valley-layer locking when the bilayer is ferromagnetic, however, spin-layer locking appears for the case of antiferromagnetic states. The inequivalent interlayer antiferroelectric couplings correspond to different magnetic ground states, and the antiferroelectric states can be switched through the breathing process, so the ferroelectric, magnetic, and valley properties can be simultaneously modulated. Through first-principles calculations, we also predict a favorable breathing Kagome bilayer W 3 Br 8 , where the above coupling mechanism and tunable layer-locked valley Hall effects can be achieved.

The temperature dependence of α E exhibits a peak at the magnetic transition temperature T C in zero magnetic field, evidencing an enhanced magnetoelectric effect near the phase boundary. When a DC magnetic field is applied along either a - or b -axis, the peak position of α E shifts continuously to a higher temperature while the peak amplitude reaches the maximum at a critical field and decays for higher magnetic fields. The obtained magnetoelectric phase diagram suggests that the maximum dynamic magnetoelectric effect occurs in a region above T C where short-range magnetic correlations play a crucial role and the peak is due to a metamagnetic transition. The measurements of the magnetostrictive coefficient dλ/d H reveal that the magnetoelectric effect is closely related to the magnetoelastic coupling.

Interestingly, we observed that in MnGe thin films, both π- and π/2-periodicities coexist. The emergence of π/2 periodicity is closely linked to specific features observed in the M–H curves. Magnetic force microscopy data reveal that the two periodic PHE signals correspond to distinct, spatially separated magnetic domains.

In this study, we theoretically investigated the motion of DWSKs driven by spin-polarized currents in ferromagnetic strips. Our findings reveal that the motion of DWSKs is contingent upon the direction of the current. When the current is applied parallel to the domain wall, both spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin–orbit torque (SOT) can drive the DWSK along the domain wall. Conversely, for currents applied perpendicular to the domain wall, STT can induce DWSK motion by leveraging the skyrmion Hall effect as a driving force, whereas SOT-driven DWSKs halt their motion after sliding along the domain wall. Furthermore, we demonstrated the current-driven motion of DWSKs along curved domain walls and proposed a racetrack memory architecture utilizing DWSKs. These findings advance the understanding of DWSK dynamics and provide insights for the design of spintronic devices based on DWSKs.},

In this study, we report the generation of a large charge-to-spin conversion and bidirectional OOP-SOT by engineering a vertical magnetization gradient within a Co/Ho multilayer system. Exploiting the antiferromagnetic coupling between Co and Ho, the magnetization gradient up to 16.8 (emu/cm −3 )/nm was achieved by gradually varying the Ho layer thickness from 0.4 to 0.9 nm. The presence of the OOP-SOT was confirmed through Hall resistance-field loop shift measurements, which has been attributed to the broken symmetry in spin current reflection and transmission in the Co/Ho multilayer with vertical magnetic property gradients. Additionally, the effective field of the OOP-SOT is strongly correlated with the direction of the magnetization gradient, measured to be around +0.7 and –2.5 Oe/mA for the positive and negative magnetization gradients, respectively. Furthermore, the largest SOT in the Co/Ho multilayer with a negative gradient was observed compared to the positive gradient and uniform Co/Ho multilayer structures. The enhanced SOT is attributed to the bulk Rashba field generated by the gradient structure, along with increased spin polarization. The results demonstrated here provide a promising approach for utilizing magnetization gradients for the development of efficient, current-driven spin-based storage and logic devices.},

An optimal QW thickness of around 2.7 nm in these InGaN/GaN LEDs was determined for QWs having constant In composition. Despite improved control of deep-level defects and lower carrier density at a given current density, LEDs with thin QWs still suffer from an imbalance in enhancement effects on the radiative and intrinsic Auger–Meitner recombination coefficients. The imbalance in enhancement effects results in a decline in internal quantum efficiency and radiative efficiency with decreasing QW thickness at low current density in LEDs with QW thicknesses below 2.7 nm. We also investigate how LED modulation bandwidth varies with QW thickness, identifying the key trends and their implications for device performance.},

With SOC included, a significant bandgap (168 meV for W 2 Rb 3 ) opens up at the band touching point, and the flatband that spans the whole Brillouin zone becomes nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number ( C = 1). The topological property calculations verify that X 2 Rb 3 monolayers are intrinsic quantum anomalous Hall effect materials.

The observed asymmetric behavior in the former scenario is attributed to the destructive interference among the edge waves.

In this work, starting from the physical origin, we propose that the charge redistribution is an effective strategy for decreasing Schottky barrier height (SBH), subsequently leading to a reduction in contact resistivity. Guided by this perspective, first-principles calculations are utilized to investigate the effect of a series of metal dopants on the SBH in the NiSi/Si system. The Φ B e values of NiSi/Si can be reduced to 0.27, 0.28, and 0.22 eV in Sc, Ti, and Zr doped systems, respectively. Especially for the Zr dopant, it can achieve ultra-low contact resistivity of 2.30 × 10 −9 Ω cm 2 , which can be ascribed to the dominant charge redistribution effect. In contrast, high electronegativity dopants like Au and Ir increase Φ B e ⁠ . Dopant diffusion and concentration effects are also examined, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. This work provides a useful theoretical guidance in reducing contact resistivity for 3D integration.},

We show FC generation for ICLs operating at λ ∼ 4.2 μ m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified shifted wave interference Fourier transform spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free running operation. Further, we show that, through active mode-locking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell–Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (∼100 ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.},

Emerging nonvolatile memory devices, e.g., ferroelectric devices based on hafnium oxide, have been suggested to overcome this bottleneck by enabling near- and in-memory computing through synaptic bit cells. However, these technologies still face challenges in the area of reliability and circuit architecture. In this article, we review recent advances in ferroelectric hafnium oxide-based synapses. In addition, we present challenges that need to be overcome before their industrial application and outline future directions for improving these devices further.},

The newly designed fluorinated cationic chromophore, 6-fluoro-2-(4-hydroxystyryl)-1-methylquinolinium (OH6FQ), has been incorporated with various fluorinated or non-fluorinated anions into six different ionic crystals. Notably, the tetrafluorinated crystals, composed of fluorinated OH6FQ cations and trifluorinated anions, meet essential requirements for efficient THz wave generation, including large macroscopic optical nonlinearity, optimal facet orientation in as-grown crystals with mm-size, plate-like morphology, and relatively low THz absorption across both the entire-molecular phonon and anion-stretching vibration regions. These tetrafluorinated crystals exhibit over 20 times higher optical-to-THz amplitude conversion efficiency compared to inorganic ZnTe, with a broad bandwidth extending up to 16 THz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of tetrafluorinated ionic organic THz crystals, showing promising potential for diverse THz photonic and nonlinear optical applications.},

Unfortunately, it is unfeasible to produce brighter quantum light sources to alleviate this problem. Here, we overcome this paradigmatic limitation by developing a quantum imaging scheme that relies on the use of natural sources of light. This is achieved by performing conditional detection on the photon number of the thermal light field scattered by a remote object. Specifically, the conditional measurements in our scheme enable us to extract quantum features of the detected thermal photons to produce quantum images with improved signal-to-noise ratios. This technique shows an exponential enhancement in the contrast of quantum images. This measurement scheme enables the possibility of producing images from the vacuum fluctuations of the light field. This is experimentally demonstrated through the implementation of a single-pixel camera with photon-number-resolving capabilities. As such, we believe that our scheme opens a new paradigm in the field of quantum imaging. It also unveils the potential of combining natural light sources with nonclassical detection schemes for the development of robust quantum technologies.},

Here, we establish for the first time the intrinsic evolution laws of Fabry–Pérot bound states in the continuum (FP-BICs), revealing that the Q factor is inversely proportional to the square of phase/frequency detuning and to the nonradiative decay rate, enabling directional engineering of FP-BIC resonances. We propose an all-dielectric multilayer film metasurface to create an optical resonator and its perfectly mirrored counterpart, inducing FP-BICs and validating the conclusions. We experimentally demonstrated the evolution of the Q factor with frequency detuning, achieving a maximum Q factor of 610 in the visible. Our work offers novel insights into BICs, promising to inspire exotic phenomena and applications.},

  abstract     = {Controlling and enhancing light–matter coupling at subwavelength scales is an essential requirement in the realm of meta-photonics. Recently, all-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs) governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a standout platform for delivering high-quality (Q) factor resonances and near-field electromagnetic hotspots. However, in the terahertz (THz) domain, experimental validation of high-Q BICs resonances with strong robustness and advanced maneuverability in such all-dielectric photonic systems remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and feasible fabrication approach to unlock the full potential of BICs-inspired resonances within the array of silicon cross elliptical resonators. Our results suggest that the designed THz-MS can support two symmetry-protected BICs with a topological charge of ±1 and several accidental BICs with a topological charge of +1 simultaneously. By introducing small perturbations to the individual resonator, the original two symmetry-protected BICs transform into quasi-BICs that bow to the inverse-square law. Astoundingly, for larger symmetry breaking, two additional BICs can be observed in the asymmetric THz-MSs surpass typical inverse-square rule, hence presenting a supererogatory degree of freedom for tailoring BICs resonances on demand. We bear out theoretical findings by transmission experiments implemented on the fabricated samples. We observe experimentally ultrasharp dual quasi-BICs resonances with a highest measured Q factor of up to 371, a level of performance that was previously unattainable with all-dielectric THz-MS on a substrate. The results mark an important step toward enriching the family of BICs and promise exciting opportunities in the field of THz optoelectronic devices and metadevices.},

  abstract     = {The obtention of quantum-grade rare-earth-doped oxide thin films that can be integrated with optical cavities and microwave resonators is of great interest for the development of scalable quantum devices. Among the different growth methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers high flexibility and has demonstrated the ability to produce oxide films hosting rare-earth ions with narrow linewidths. However, growing epitaxial films directly on silicon is challenging by CVD due to a native amorphous oxide layer formation at the interface. In this manuscript, we investigate the CVD growth of erbium-doped yttrium oxide (Er:Y 2 O 3 ) thin films on different substrates, including silicon, sapphire, quartz, or yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Alternatively, growth was also attempted on an epitaxial Y 2 O 3 template layer on Si (111) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to circumvent the issue of the amorphous interlayer. We found that the substrate impacts the film morphology and the crystalline orientations, with different textures observed for the CVD film on the MBE-oxide/Si template (111) and epitaxial growth on YSZ (001). In terms of optical properties, Er 3+ ions exhibit visible and IR emission features that are comparable for all samples, indicating a high-quality local crystalline environment regardless of the substrate. Our approach opens interesting prospects to integrate such films into scalable devices for optical quantum technologies.},

However, the bulky nature of Ga 2 O 3 limits its application in miniaturized, integrated and multifunctional devices, and polarization imaging based on Ga 2 O 3 photodetector has not yet been realized. Here, we report a convenient method to prepare 2D β-Ga 2 O 3 flakes via liquid-metal-assisted exfoliation. Benefiting from high crystallinity and polarization-sensitive absorption of prepared ultrathin β-Ga 2 O 3 flake in monoclinic structure, the β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetector exhibits an ultra-fast response speed (100/78 μ s for rise/decay time) and a prominent anisotropy ratio (∼2.8) of polarization photoresponse under 265 nm illumination. An unambiguous detection of linearly polarized light has also been realized by the double symmetry-breaking of twisted β-Ga 2 O 3 photodetectors. Moreover, a four-layer twistedly stacked detection system further enables a one-step and well-defined polarization imaging with high resolution (150 × 150 pixels) to acquire spatial polarization information. This work presents a novel strategy for preparing ultrathin 2D gallium oxides and demonstrates a promising route to realize well-defined solar-blind polarization imaging in a simple manner.},

Here, we demonstrate a significant shift of ferromagnetic resonance spectra in ferromagnetic films placed between two superconductor gating layers. Through deliberate modifications of the interface structure using various insertion layers, we have determined that the superconducting proximity effect has a minimal impact on the modulation of ferromagnetic resonance characteristics. Instead, our findings strongly support very recent theoretical predictions that emphasize the phenomenon of ultrastrong coupling between Kittel magnons and Cooper pairs arising from the superconducting magnetoelectric effect. We propose that this ultrastrong coupling not only provides a precise method for determining superconducting parameters like the London penetration depth but also lays the foundation for the manipulation of spin waves through superconductors in future magnonic circuits.},

  abstract     = {As an effective method for thermal management technologies, doping or substitution has been extensively utilized to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of various materials. Intensive studies have been conducted about the phonon mechanism of isoelectronic alloying since the 1950s. Very recently, the specific role of aliovalent doping was elucidated in the half-Heusler NbFeSb system. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally investigated the mechanism of reducing thermal conductivity through aliovalent doping by combining first-principles calculations and neutron diffraction studies for the case study of the TiCoSb half-Heusler system. The softening of the acoustic branches induced by aliovalent doping can effectively reduce the phonon group velocities. Moreover, the introduction of compensating defects, resulting from changes in the Fermi level, plays a vital role in decreasing the relaxation time of phonons, as demonstrated by the analysis of neutron powder diffraction. Due to these two factors, doping with adjacent elements results in a significant reduction in lattice thermal conductivity (for instance, Ni doping at the Co site in the TiCoSb half-Heusler system), especially in the low-temperature range. Our findings provide valuable insight into the phonon scattering mechanism in aliovalent-doped materials and demonstrate the role of compensating defects in heat transport, which is applicable to other doped semiconductor systems.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the efficacy of an untethered magnetic robot (UMR) for wireless mechanical and hybrid blood clot removal in ex vivo tissue environments. By integrating x-ray-guided wireless manipulation with UMRs, we aim to address challenges associated with precise and controlled blood clot intervention. The untethered nature and size of these robots enhance maneuverability and accessibility within complex vascular networks, potentially improving clot removal efficiency. We explore mechanical fragmentation, chemical lysis, and hybrid dissolution techniques that combine mechanical fragmentation with chemical lysis, highlighting their potential for targeted and efficient blood clot removal. Through experimental validation using an ex vivo endovascular thrombosis model within the iliac artery of a sheep, we demonstrate direct revascularization of a 13-mm-long, 1-day-old blood clot positioned inside the left common iliac artery. This was achieved by deploying a UMR into the abdominal aorta within 15 min. Additionally, both mechanical fragmentation and hybrid dissolution achieve a greater volume rate of change compared to no intervention (control) and chemical lysis alone. Mechanical fragmentation exhibits clot removal with a median of 0.87 mm 3 /min and a range of 2.81 mm 3 /min, while the hybrid approach demonstrates slower but more consistent clot removal, with a median of 0.45 mm 3 /min and a range of 0.23 mm 3 /min.},

  abstract     = {Phototransistors have great application prospects in automotive vehicle, smart home, healthcare, imaging, and display. However, so far, there has been no report of flexible phototransistors that simultaneously achieve both high mobility and detectivity. Additionally, phototransistors are conventionally relied on thick channel layers and previous thin channel layers based devices only show poor performance. Here, we report flexible phototransistors based on ultrathin niobium-doped indium oxide (InNbO, 5 nm)/indium tin oxide (ITO, 3 nm) channel layers, which possess high mobility (49.21 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and high detectivity (3.02 × 10 14 Jones) simultaneously. Significantly, the devices offer a broad spectral responsivity (from violet to green emissions). We postulate that the high mobility can be ascribed to the diffusion of Sn atoms (from ITO) and conduction band offset (between InNbO and ITO), while the high detectivity originates from the low dark current. To illustrate the capabilities of flexible phototransistors, we demonstrate both a flexible active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display pixel circuit and an imaging system. Our approach unlocks new possibilities to achieve flexible phototransistors with superior performance, which suggest a great potential in next-generation flexible, stretchable, bendable, and low-cost electronics.},

  abstract     = {Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a prominent branch of non-linear optics (NLO) heavily reliant on conventional bulk NLO crystals. However, the difficulty in downsizing these crystals imposes technical limitations on the future of miniaturized NLO devices. Tellurene emerges as a promising candidate to overcome these restrictions, excelling in electrical applications and believed to possess a giant second-order optical susceptibility comparable to conventional NLO crystals. In this study, a face-to-face substrate configuration is employed for the synthesis of ultrathin tellurene via PVD. Our findings reveal that tellurene&#39;s SHG performance surpasses that of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides by two orders of magnitude, with maximum efficiency when the flake thickness is between 16 and 20 nm under various wavelengths. High sensitivity to thickness variation encourages post-growth thinning through hydrogen plasma etching, enabling precise engineering of the flake thickness for optimal SHG. This establishes a foundation for controlled tellurene thickness, further broadening its potential in diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {The band alignment (BA) between two materials is a fundamental property that governs the functionality and performance of electronic and electrochemical devices. However, despite decades of study, the inability to separate surface properties from those of the bulk has made a deep understanding of the physics of BAs elusive. Building on the theory of the ideal vacuum level to separate surface from bulk [Choe et al. , Phys. Rev. B 103 , 235202 (2021)], here we present a geometric theory for the band alignment, specifically explaining the insensitivity of the alignment to interfacial orientation between isotropic materials. First, we adopt a neutral polyhedron, termed Wigner-Seitz atoms (WSA), to partition the charge of atoms in a way that maintains crystal symmetry and tessellates the space. In contrast to the CWZ theory, the band alignment of two materials constructed from such WSAs is independent of interface orientation. Upon electron relaxation at the interface, we show that the interfacial charge transfer dipole can be accurately described by the sum of localized point dipoles that exist between atoms at the interface (bond dipoles). For interfaces between isotropic materials, the magnitude of the bond dipole can be factored out as a multiplier, leaving only geometric factors, such as crystal symmetry and dimension of the material, to determine band alignment, regardless of the orientation of the interface. We considered 29 distinct interfaces and found that this bond dipole theory yields excellent agreement (RMS deviation &lt; 30 meV) with first-principles results. Our theory can be easily applied to interface between alloys, as well as between anisotropic systems.},

While most previous works have focused on isotropic BMR, arising from isotropic band structure or the spin Hall effect, we report on a strongly anisotropic BMR (ABMR) observed at the KTaO 3 Rashba interface, characterized by a unique low-symmetry Fermi surface. For the first time, we have successfully achieved significant regulation of ABMR through the application of gate voltage. Our quantified analysis reveals a profound link between the tunable anisotropy in Rashba spin splitting and the precise modulation of the Fermi level filling, highlighting its central role in governing gate-modulated ABMR. Additionally, we introduce a rigorous physical model that provides a deep and nuanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying gate-voltage-controlled ABMR.

  abstract     = {Bi 1− x Sb x alloys are classic thermoelectric materials for near-cryogenic applications. Despite more than half a century of study, unraveling the underlying transport physics within this space has been nontrivial due to the complex electronic structure, disorder, and small bandgap within these alloys. Furthermore, as Peltier coolers, Bi 1− x Sb x alloys operate in a bipolar regime; as such, understanding the impact of minority carriers is critical for further improvements in device performance. This study unites first principles calculations with low-temperature experimental measurements to create a generalized model for transport within semiconducting Bi-Sb alloys. Our exploration reveals the interplay between the complex, degenerate valence band structure with the extremely light conduction bands. By building a hybrid computational/experimental model, an understanding of both the electron and hole relaxation times emerges both as a function of temperature and energy. Special quasi-random supercell calculations reveal that, despite significant atomic disorder, the electronic band structures within the alloy remains largely unaffected and electron–phonon scattering dominates. For charge carriers near the band edges, the relaxation times are thus extremely long, consistent with cyclotronic behavior appearing at low magnetic fields ( ⁠ ≪ 1 T). Modeling thermoelectric performance suggests that the valence band edge deformation potential is significantly weaker and highlights the potential for p -type compositions to meet or exceed the current n -type alloys.},

  abstract     = {As a wide bandgap semiconductor, diamond holds both excellent electrical and thermal properties, making it highly promising in the electrical industry. However, its hole mobility is relatively low and dramatically decreases with increasing temperature, which severely limits further applications. Herein, we proposed that the hole mobility can be efficiently enhanced via slight compressive shear strain along the [100] direction, while the improvement via shear strain along the [111] direction is marginal. This impressive distinction is attributed to the deformation potential and the elastic compliance matrix. The shear strain breaks the symmetry of the crystalline structure and lifts the band degeneracy near the valence band edge, resulting in a significant suppression of interband electron–phonon scattering. Moreover, the hole mobility becomes less temperature-dependent due to the decrease of electron scatterings from high-frequency acoustic phonons. Remarkably, the in-plane hole mobility of diamond is increased by ∼ 800 % at 800 K with a 2% compressive shear strain along the [100] direction. The efficient shear strain strategy can be further extended to other semiconductors with face-centered cubic geometry.},

This study focuses on three-terminal synaptic transistors utilizing graphene and P(VDF-TrFE) to achieve dynamic reconfigurability between excitatory and inhibitory response modes, which are crucial for mimicking biological functions. The devices operate by applying different top gate spikes (±25 V and ±10 V) to modulate the polarization degree of P(VDF-TrFE), thereby regulating the carrier type and concentration in the graphene channel. This results in the effective realization of enhancement and inhibition processes in two neural-like states: excitatory and inhibitory modes, accompanied by good neural plasticity with paired-pulse facilitation and spike-time-dependent plasticity. With these features, the synaptic devices achieve brain-like memory enhancement and human-like perception functions, exhibiting excellent stability, durability over 1000 cycles, and a long retention period exceeding 10 years. Additionally, the performance of the artificial neural network is evaluated for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 92.28%.

  abstract     = {Electrochromic oxides have tremendous potential applications in smart windows, displays, and camouflage due to their capability for selective modulation of visible and near-infrared optical spectra. Although these applications are dependent on the optical performance, the origin of the optical absorption in electrochromic oxides is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that the electrochromism of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides can be described by a combination of polaron and bipolaron hopping. Based on the valences of the metallic constituents, we model experimental optical absorption spectra by polaron theory and assign two prominent absorption peaks to polaronic and bipolaronic charge transfer excitations. However, in the special case of V 2 O 5 , three peaks were necessary to fit the optical spectra. The activation energies of polaronic and bipolaronic hopping were remarkably similar for all the cathodic oxides studied. Within the framework of polaron absorption, V 2 O 5 would be categorized as a cathodic oxide, rather than as a mixed anodic/cathodic material as in the conventional picture. We emphasize that our findings here not only offer a profound understanding of all amorphous cathodic electrochromic oxides but also pave the way for exploring electrochromic oxides with dual-band modulations.},

Despite theoretical investigations suggesting that polaron dynamics mediate the MIT, direct experimental evidence remains scarce. In this study, we present direct evidence of the polaron state in insulating VO 2 through high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements and first-principles calculations. We illustrate the complementary role of polaron dynamics in facilitating Peierls and Mott transitions, thereby contributing to the MIT processes. Furthermore, our observations and characterizations of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in the respective phases of the VO 2 film offer valuable insight into their electron structures. This investigation enhances comprehension of the MIT mechanism in correlated systems and underscores the roles of polarons, lattice distortions, and electron correlations in facilitating phase transition processes in strongly correlated systems. Additionally, the detailed detection of small polarons and plasmons serves as inspiration for the development of new device functionalities.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional materials with multiple degrees of freedom, including spin, valleys, and orbitals, open up an exciting avenue for engineering multifunctional devices. Beyond spintronics, these degrees of freedom can lead to novel quantum effects such as valley-dependent Hall effects and orbital magnetism, which could revolutionize next-generation electronics. However, achieving independent control over valley polarization and orbital magnetism has been a challenge due to the need for large electric fields. A recent breakthrough involving pentalayer rhombohedral graphene has demonstrated the ability to individually manipulate anomalous Hall signals and orbital magnetic hysteresis, forming what is known as a valley-magnetic quartet. Here, we leverage the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity of pentalayer rhombohedral graphene to develop nonvolatile memory and in-memory computation applications. We propose an architecture for a dense, scalable, and selector-less nonvolatile memory array that harnesses the electrically tunable ferro-valleytricity. In our designed array architecture, nondestructive read and write operations are conducted by sensing the valley state through two different pairs of terminals, allowing for independent optimization of read/write peripheral circuits. The power consumption of our PRG-based array is remarkably low, with only ∼6 nW required per write operation and ∼2.3 nW per read operation per cell. This consumption is orders of magnitude lower than that of the majority of state-of-the-art cryogenic memories. Additionally, we engineer in-memory computation by implementing majority logic operations within our proposed nonvolatile memory array without modifying the peripheral circuitry. Our framework presents a promising pathway toward achieving ultra-dense cryogenic memory and in-memory computation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Micro- and nano-electromechanical systems resonators have been regarded as powerful tools for precision mass detection, and their abilities to measure these in a liquid environment open various opportunities for biosensing, chemical analysis, and environmental monitoring. Apart from overcoming issues of fluidic damping and electrical interfaces, there is a great challenge of bringing microanalytes to these devices with the required precision and scaling for high throughput sensing. Herein, we address the above challenges by proposing a self-excited localized acoustic manipulation methodology based on a piezoelectric micromechanical diaphragm resonator (PMDR). Such a PMDR integrates acoustofluidics and mass sensing functions in tandem on a single device. Particle enrichment is realized within tens of seconds and the limit of detection is enhanced by mitigating common issues such as low capture rate and non-uniform distribution. The developed PMDR is versatile in its applicability to a range of particle sizes and densities for both acoustofluidic actuation and in situ mass sensing. This work addresses long-term technical challenges of inaccurate and inefficient measurement of liquid phase resonance mass sensing with great application potentials in biochemical detection and environmental monitoring.},

The complexities of several metamaterial architectures are discussed. A new classification system is proposed to distinguish metamaterial configurations based on the typology of the channels inside the acoustic meta-atom. Several types of acoustic metamaterials architectures, such as perforated and micro-perforated panels, acoustic foams, resonators, various geometrical paths, and piezoelectric patches, are also discussed. The fundamental acoustic mechanisms of these classes of metamaterials are identified and commented on.

  abstract     = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been studied intensively, and their practical applications are advancing. The efficiency of light-emitting materials has been improved significantly through the understanding of their emission mechanisms. However, the correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the operating voltage in OLEDs remains unclear, because OLEDs require a complex multilayer configuration that includes many materials other than the emitter. It is difficult to investigate the exact energy diagram for OLEDs, which have many interfaces, and many uncertainties remain regarding the mechanisms of charge injection and recombination. In this review, we introduce both the charge injection and recombination mechanisms in OLEDs and the interface control technology effective for lowering their operating voltage. We explain the electron injection mechanism at organic/cathode interfaces, which is clarified by using organic bases as the electron injection layers. The hole injection mechanism in OLEDs, which is clarified by investigating the correlation between the characteristics of OLEDs and the actual energy levels at organic/anode interfaces, is also introduced. With the elucidation of the charge injection mechanism, holes and electrons can now be injected into various organic materials. These charge injection techniques minimize the voltage required for charge recombination. The correlation between the bandgap of the emitter and the minimum voltage required for OLED operation is clarified by controlling the energy levels at organic/organic interfaces. Understanding this correlation enables the design of molecules for ultralow-voltage OLEDs, thereby realizing blue OLEDs with an extremely low turn-on voltage of about 1.5 V.},

  abstract     = {Smart biomaterials have significantly impacted human healthcare by advancing the development of medical devices designed to function within human tissue, mimicking the behavior of natural tissues. While the intelligence of biomaterials has evolved from inert to active over the past few decades, smart biomaterials take this a step further by making their surfaces or bulk respond based on interactions with surrounding tissues, imparting outcomes similar to natural tissue functions. This interaction with the surrounding tissue helps in creating stimuli-responsive biomaterials, which can be useful in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, autonomous drug delivery, orthopedics, and much more. Traditionally, material engineering focused on refining the static properties of biomaterials to accommodate them within the body without evoking an immune response, which was a major obstacle to their unrestricted operation. This review highlights and explains various engineering approaches currently under research for developing stimuli-responsive biomaterials that tune their outcomes based on responses to bodily factors like temperature, pH, and ion concentration or external factors like magnetism, light, and conductivity. Applications in soft and hard tissue engineering, 4D printing, and scaffold design are also discussed. The advanced application of microfluidics, like organ-on-a-chip models, extensively benefits from the intrinsic smart properties of biomaterials, which are also discussed below. The review further elaborates on how smart biomaterial engineering could revolutionize biosensor applications, thereby improving patient care quality. We delineate the limitations and key challenges associated with biomaterials, providing insights into the path forward and outlining future directions for developing next-generation biomaterials that will facilitate clinical translation.},

The process from shape printing of microvasculature to function formation involves dynamic shift of bioink mechanical properties, mechanical microenvironments, and mechanobiology of endothelial and supporting cells. This review explores how biomechanical and mechanobiological principles are integrated into the bioprinting process to develop functional microvascular networks. Before printing, a top-level design approach based on these principles focuses on the interactions among biomaterials, cell behaviors, and mechanical environments to guide microvascular network fabrication. During printing, biomechanical design of bioinks for different bioprinting techniques, along with optimized biomechanical factors of bioprinting process, ensures accurate microvascular structure reproduction while maintaining cell viability. After printing, the emphasis is on creating a suitable mechanical environment to modulate the mechanobiology of multiple steps of neovascularization, including initiation, morphogenesis, lumen formation, stabilization, and maturation of functional microvasculature. Finally, we discuss future developments based on biomechanical and mechanobiological design to drive the bioprinting of functionalized microvascular networks.},

  abstract     = {The advent of artificial intelligence—deep neural networks (DNNs) in particular—has transformed traditional research methods across many disciplines. DNNs are data driven systems that use large quantities of data to learn patterns that are fundamental to a process. In the realm of artificial electromagnetic materials (AEMs), a common goal is to discover the connection between the AEM&#39;s geometry and material properties to predict the resulting scattered electromagnetic fields. To achieve this goal, DNNs usually utilize computational electromagnetic simulations to act as ground truth data for the training process, and numerous successful results have been shown. Although DNNs have many demonstrated successes, they are limited by their requirement for large quantities of data and their lack of interpretability. The latter results because DNNs are black-box models, and therefore, it is unknown how or why they work. A promising approach which may help to mitigate the aforementioned limitations is to use physics to guide the development and operation of DNNs. Indeed, this physics-informed learning (PHIL) approach has seen rapid development in the last few years with some success in addressing limitations of conventional DNNs. We overview the field of PHIL and discuss the benefits of incorporating knowledge into the deep learning process and introduce a taxonomy that enables us to categorize various types of approaches. We also summarize deep learning principles which are critical to PHIL understanding and the Appendix covers some of the physics of AEMs. A few specific PHIL works are highlighted and serve as examples of various approaches. Finally, we provide an outlook detailing where the field is currently and what we can expect in the future.},

Recently, multi-material additive manufacturing (MMAM) has become an emerging processing approach to prototype energy storage and conversion devices by enabling the fabrication of complex systems in a single, streamlined process while offering design freedom to customize end-product properties at precise, user-defined patterns and geometries. Moreover, it provides opportunities to fine-tune interfaces and material compositions at the microscale, opening new avenues for next-generation energy storage and conversion devices. As MMAM is still in its early stages, a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between material chemistry, processing methods, and device design is fundamental to fully realize its potential for developing high-performance energy materials.

Na 1+ x Zr 2 Si x P 3− x O 12 (NaSICON) SEs have recently regained attention for applications in both solid-state and aqueous redox flow batteries due to their improved electrochemical and mechanical properties, along with their inherent electrochemical stability, air robustness, and low manufacturing cost. Recent improvements in NaSICON have primarily targeted macroscopic property enhancements and synthesis techniques. To enable further breakthroughs in the performance of NaSICON SEs, future efforts should focus on understanding how modified synthesis conditions influence atomic and microscopic-scale features, such as conduction channels, electronic structures, phase distributions, and grain boundaries. These features ultimately control ion conductivity, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability of NaSICON and its interfaces. Here, we review the current understanding of the structure-chemistry-property relationships of NaSICON SEs, focusing on atomic and microscopic levels. First, we introduce the proposed ionic conduction mechanisms in NaSICON crystallites. Then, we explore experimental investigations at phase and grain boundaries to assess ionic conduction and interfacial stability. We also examine strategies to address interfacial challenges such as high resistance and chemical reactions between SEs and electrodes, highlighting the difficulties in analyzing interfaces at the nano/atomic scale.

  abstract     = {Nuclear energy emerges as a promising and environmentally friendly solution to counter the escalating levels of greenhouse gases resulting from excessive fossil fuel usage. Essential to harnessing this energy are nuclear batteries, devices designed to generate electric power by capturing the energy emitted during nuclear decay, including α or β particles and γ radiation. The allure of nuclear batteries lies in their potential for extended lifespan, high energy density, and adaptability in harsh environments where refueling or battery replacement may not be feasible. In this review, we narrow our focus to nuclear batteries utilizing non-thermal converters such as α- or β-voltaics, as well as those employing scintillation intermediates. Recent advancements in state-of-the-art direct radiation detectors and scintillators based on metal perovskite halides (MPHs) and chalcogenides (MCs) are compared to traditional detectors based on silicon and III-V materials, and scintillators based on inorganic lanthanide crystals. Notable achievements in MPH and MC detectors and scintillators, such as nano-Gy sensitivity, 100 photons/keV light yield, and radiation hardness, are highlighted. Additionally, limitations including energy conversion efficiency, power density, and shelf-life due to radiation damage in detectors and scintillators are discussed. Leveraging novel MPH and MC materials has the potential to propel nuclear batteries from their current size and power limitations to miniaturization, heightened efficiency, and increased power density. Furthermore, exploring niche applications for nuclear batteries beyond wireless sensors, low-power electronics, oil well monitoring, and medical fields presents enticing opportunities for future research and development.},

Thus, engineering magnetic order in materials such as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism holds great scientific and technological interest. Defects such as vacancies, interstitials, and dopants induce local perturbations within the crystal lattice. These perturbations locally disturb the entire symmetry of crystals, resulting in symmetry breaking. Oxides, in particular, exhibit intriguing properties when subjected to defects, which can lead to significant modifications in their structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Such defects in non-magnetic oxides can induce magnetic symmetry breaking, leading to the formation of emergent magnetic domains and orderings.

Diamond, Ga 2 O 3 , GaN, and SiC are typical WBS materials. Reliability studies for these four materials and devices are crucial for WBS applications. Traditional means of reliability studies include, but are not limited to, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopy et al. However, most of these methods are ex situ studies after material or device failure and thus have some limitations. In situ transmission electron microscope (TEM) is a favorable technology to observe the degradation and failure process of materials and devices in real time, which may provide effective guidance in material growth, device structure design, device process optimization, and reliability improvement.

As a result, a wide variety of PDs on planar substrates have been reported using various light sensitive materials and traditional micro-/nano-fabrication technologies. In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing PDs with flexible form factors and using eco-friendly materials and approaches. These efforts have resulted in exploration of degradable materials and printed electronics as a resource-efficient route for manufacturing and to contain end-of-life issues. This paper reviews such new advances, particularly focusing on flexible PDs based on inorganic (e.g., crystalline silicon, compound semiconductors, metal oxides, etc.) semiconductor nanostructures [e.g., Nanowires (NWs), Nanoribbons (NRs), etc.]. The advantages and disadvantages of various bottom-up and top-down methods explored to realize the nanostructures and the wet (solution-processable) and dry printing and assembly methods to print the nanostructures on flexible substrates, are discussed along with their suitability for various applications. This discussion is supported by a comparative analysis of printed PDs in terms of key performance metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, I Light /I Dark ratio, response speed, and external quantum efficiency. This comprehensive discussion is expected to benefit researchers and practitioners from academia and industry interested in the field of printed and flexible PDs.},

To accommodate these applications, suitable methods for generating the quantum states are needed. Today, the quantum states are often produced by a spontaneous nonlinear process in a standard nonlinear material, followed by a series of optical elements necessary for encoding the desired state on the generated photons. In this review, we consider an alternative approach of structuring the nonlinearity of the crystal so that the desired quantum state will be generated directly at the crystal, without the need for additional elements. Our main focus here is on bulk crystals having structured second-order nonlinearity. The rising interest in these nonlinear metamaterials is fueled by advancements in the ability to efficiently simulate and design spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) processes, as well as by new capabilities of structuring the nonlinearity of ferroelectric crystals, either by electric field poling or by laser-induced writing. As a result, nonlinear metamaterials were recently used to directly shape the spatial and spectral correlations of quantum light that is generated in SPDC. The paper covers the theoretical background and the design and fabrication methods of bulk nonlinear metamaterials for generating quantum light, as well as a series of demonstrations of the use of metamaterials in quantum optical applications.},

  abstract     = {Capacitive tactile sensors have garnered significant attention due to their simple structure, temperature independence, and wide applicability. However, with the continuous evolution of the intellectualization process, developing tactile sensors that can compare or even surpass the sensing ability of human skin remains a significant challenge. Consequently, various strategies aimed at enhancing sensing performance have emerged, with the introduction of morphological structures into the active layer being the most effective. In light of this, capacitive tactile sensors based on morphological structure designs have gained favor among researchers, gradually forming a “hundred schools of thought contend” trend. Nevertheless, the processes and applicability of morphological structures have yet to form a complete system, and the development and intelligence of morphological-engineering-based capacitive tactile sensors have reached a bottleneck stage, requiring a comprehensive and systematic review to provide inspiration for breakthroughs. This review delves deeply into the impact of various morphological structure designs on device performance and provides a comprehensive overview of the applicability, advantages, and disadvantages of morphological structure fabrication technologies derived from these structures. Finally, their progress in advanced intelligent systems is summarized, and the challenges and prospects faced in this emerging field are envisioned.},

Theoretical modeling methodologies, such as density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), efficiently assess electrochemical reaction mechanisms and electrocatalyst performance at atomic and molecular levels. However, its intrinsic algorithm limitations and high computational costs for large-scale systems generate gaps between experimental observations and calculation simulation, restricting the accuracy and efficiency of electrocatalyst design. Combining machine learning (ML) is a promising strategy to accelerate the development of electrocatalysts. The ML-DFT frameworks establish accurate property–structure–performance relations to predict and verify novel electrocatalysts&#39; properties and performance, providing a deep understanding of reaction mechanisms. The ML-based methods also accelerate the solution of MD and DFT. Moreover, integrating ML and experiment characterization techniques represents a cutting-edge approach to providing insights into the structural, electronic, and chemical changes under working conditions.

So, to realize these devices, an extensive study, from fundamental physics to practical applications, becomes essential. In this article, we present an exhaustive review of the advancements in understanding the fundamental physics behind magnetic skyrmions and the novel data storage and computing technologies based on them. We begin with an in-depth discussion of fundamental concepts such as topological protection, stability, statics, and dynamics essential for understanding skyrmions, henceforth the foundation of skyrmion technologies. For the realization of CMOS-compatible skyrmion functional devices, the writing and reading of the skyrmions are crucial. We discuss the developments in different writing schemes such as STT, SOT, and VCMA. The reading of skyrmions is predominantly achieved via two mechanisms: the magnetoresistive tunnel junction TMR effect and topological resistivity. So, a thorough investigation into the skyrmion Hall effect, topological properties, and emergent fields is also provided, concluding the discussion on skyrmion reading developments. Based on the writing and reading schemes, we discuss the applications of the skyrmions in conventional logic, unconventional logic, memory applications, and neuromorphic computing, including a model of a skyrmion-based SNN architecture achieving over 90% accuracy on MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets. Furthermore, we outline the potential of skyrmion-hosting Majorana zero modes in emerging topological quantum computation and helicity-dependent skyrmion qubits.},

  abstract     = {Solar fuel production through water splitting and CO 2 reduction by employing photocatalytic materials is a paradigm track to present renewable energy sources and lessen global warming. Among these materials, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been widely investigated in CO 2 reduction and water splitting to produce chemical fuels. However, pure LDHs suffer from sluggish charge-carrier transport, a great electron–hole recombination rate as well as tend to cause agglomeration. Due to the aforementioned bottlenecks, numerous modification techniques have been considerably explored to enhance the potential of LDHs toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO 2 photoreduction. Therefore, this article presents a thorough review of developments made for the construction and modification of LDH photocatalyst properties aiming to enhance water splitting and photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. The review starts with the techniques adopted to synthesize LDH-based structures toward enhanced structure and morphology. The key semiconducting, optical, and electronic properties are studied to understand the conduct of LDH materials toward excellent photocatalytic material. The study then deliberates the techniques such as morphological engineering, hybridization with conducting and semiconducting materials, vacancy creation and defect engineering, components tuning, photothermal catalysis, heterojunction, and heterostructural engineering employed for the enrichment of photocatalytic properties. The study also discusses the steps taken to enhance the adsorption of LDHs and coupling of computational and operando techniques toward semiconducting, structural, and optical properties to investigate the best-performing photocatalysts. The study also reviews the recent advancements of LDH for applications toward water splitting and CO 2 conversion.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising cancer biomarkers due to their encapsulation of molecular signals reflective of originating tumor cells. Conventional analytical methods often fall short in comprehensive EV molecular profiling, necessitating innovative approaches for enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. This review focuses on the utilization of nanoplasmonic structures for optical signal detection of EVs, exploring advancements, challenges, and future prospects toward single EV molecular profiling. Nanoplasmonic structures offer enhanced optical readout capabilities, leveraging light iridescence, and plasmonic amplification suitable for the size range and complexity of the EVs. We delve into the research and implications of on-chip methods, shedding light on EVs&#39; role in health and disease. Despite notable progress, opportunities still exist to further develop nanoplasmonic arrays, customizing them for bioanalytes of interest, crucial for both label-free and labeled techniques to attain the objectives of their EV profiling. One such example is the use of specific antibodies for surface functionalization in nanoplasmonic arrays. Other approaches involve tailoring the design of platforms to the physical properties of target EVs, thereby enhancing characterization capabilities. The subsequent sections will cover a curated selection of relevant studies. We later discuss EV analysis through plasmonic nanoarrays in clinical sample scenarios. While patterning methods, such as colloidal self-assembly and e-beam lithography, enable integration with microfluidic systems, facilitating future investigations, few technologies have entered clinical trials. This roadblock highlights the need for further development of cost-effective, detailed molecular profiling methods. Moreover, we discuss avenues like single EV profiling and machine learning to address challenges related to heterogeneity of EVs as liquid biopsy biomarkers. Finally, we discuss future opportunities in developing nanoplasmonic-assisted EV profiling and studied their driving advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic realms, such as customizable nanoplasmonic structures coupled with artificial intelligence analysis modules, as a path forward for precise EV molecular profiling, which may enable personalized therapeutic interventions.},

The presence of two novel functionalities, i.e., direct and converse ME couplings, makes them ideal candidates for multifunctional devices such as energy harvesters, magnetic field sensors, ME random access memories, and ME antennas. In these ME composites, ME coupling is strongly dependent on the superior physical properties of the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials. Therefore, magnetostrictive materials with excellent piezomagnetic coefficients and piezoelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric coefficients are required to achieve a large ME coupling. Among the various piezoelectric materials, ferroelectric relaxor-PbTiO 3 (PT) single crystals have been used extensively as piezoelectric constituents because of their ultrahigh piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Furthermore, the domain structure and crystal orientation of the relaxor-PT single crystals exhibit extraordinarily large piezoelectric and electromechanical properties. Owing to these multifunctional properties, relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites have been widely used for studying direct and converse ME couplings in ME composites in recent years. Relaxor-PT single-crystal-based ME composites show excellent ME coupling, e.g., the highest ME voltage coefficient, equivalent magnetic noise, and output power of 7000 V cm − 1 Oe − 1 @ 23.23 kHz, 6 pT/√Hz @1 Hz, and 19 mW @ 60 Hz, respectively, which are one of the best-reported values in ME composites so far.

To address this challenge, coupling single-photon emitters with designer nanostructures can significantly enhance emission performance, a pivotal area in quantum nanophotonics. This review summarizes recent advancements over the past decade in generating and manipulating single photons, emphasizing the pivotal role of nanostructure coupling. Single-photon emission systems—such as nonlinear crystals, solid-state defects, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and two-dimensional materials—are categorized quantitatively based on their ability to achieve high purity, indistinguishability, and brightness, presented in a three-dimensional technology map. Furthermore, nanostructure engineering is showcased for manipulating properties such as emission direction, polarization, chirality, and entanglement of single photons.

  abstract     = {Phase transitions are fundamental phenomena in physics that have been extensively studied owing to their applications across diverse industrial sectors, including energy, power, healthcare, and the environment. An example of such applications in the energy sector is thermal energy storage using phase change materials. In such systems, and indeed in many other thermal systems, an emerging and promising approach involves the use of nanoparticles, which have been extensively studied for their potential to enhance the performance of thermal systems. However, conducting thermodynamic analyses of thermal systems in the presence of nanoparticles proves to be complex and resource-consuming because of the involvement of many parameters, including (i) temperature, molecular structure, and composition of the host fluid in which nanoparticles are either dispersed or in physical contact; (ii) nanoparticle morphology, size, type, and concentration; and (iii) complex interactions between the nanoparticles and the base fluid. This article reviews recent studies on the role of nanoparticles in phase transition processes such as freezing, melting, boiling, evaporation, and condensation. It begins with an overview of phase transition phenomena without nanoparticles, emphasizing the most important controlling parameters, and then examines the underlying physics of nanoparticle-involved phase transitions, critically examining their impact on process speed (transport rates). The article also explores physical phenomena, such as Brownian motion, thermophoresis, microconvection, and nanoparticle agglomeration, and considers their contribution to rate control (enhancement or reduction). Finally, the article presents challenges, research gaps, and suggestions for future exploration, aimed at offering a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between the presence of nanoparticles and the phase transition processes.},

  abstract     = {Droplet microfluidics has emerged as highly relevant technology in diverse fields such as nanomaterials synthesis, photonics, drug delivery, regenerative medicine, food science, cosmetics, and agriculture. While significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying droplet generation in microchannels and in fabricating devices to produce droplets with varied functionality and high throughput, challenges persist along two important directions. On one side, the generalization of numerical results obtained by computational fluid dynamics would be important to deepen the comprehension of complex physical phenomena in droplet microfluidics, as well as the capability of predicting the device behavior. Conversely, truly three-dimensional architectures would enhance microfluidic platforms in terms of tailoring and enhancing droplet and flow properties. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and additive manufacturing (AM) promise unequaled opportunities for simulating fluid behavior, precisely tracking individual droplets, and exploring innovative device designs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in applying AI and AM to droplet microfluidics. The basic physical properties of multiphase flows and mechanisms for droplet production are discussed, and the current fabrication methods of related devices are introduced, together with their applications. Delving into the use of AI and AM technologies in droplet microfluidics, topics covered include AI-assisted simulations of droplet behavior, real-time tracking of droplets within microfluidic systems, and AM-fabrication of three-dimensional systems. The synergistic combination of AI and AM is expected to deepen the understanding of complex fluid dynamics and active matter behavior, expediting the transition toward fully digital microfluidic systems.},

  abstract     = {Electrokinetic energy harvesting (EKEH) has emerged as a promising renewable and carbon-neutral energy source for small and large-scale applications, reducing the reliance on conventional fossil fuels and providing innovative solutions for remote, off-grid applications. The underlying mechanism of EKEH relies on the movement of dissolved electrolytes over charged fluid–solid interfaces through confinements resulting in the generation of useful power. The low energy conversion efficiency typically observed in larger (micrometer) confinements can be substantially mitigated by shifting to nanometer and sub-nanometer regimes. This down-scaling unlocks high selectivity and provides unique opportunities to potentially harness Angstrom-scale interactions to maintain and elevate fluid permeability. However, EKEH at sub-nanometric scales remains fraught with considerable challenges in fabrication, economic viability, scaling of power, and maintenance, significantly impeding its advancement. In this review, we detail the electrokinetic processes that drive energy conversion in the presence of pressure, concentration, and temperature gradients. We examine the key factors affecting conversion efficiency and explore the innovative solutions in the recent literature addressing associated challenges. Additionally, we highlight the role of novel nanomaterials and specialized geometries along with new fabrication techniques that enable high permeation without sacrificing selectivity in nanometer and sub-nanometer confinements. Finally, we delve into the major obstacles that EKEH currently faces to reach its full potential of extracting clean and affordable energy and conclude by offering insight into future developmental directions and potential breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.},

Normally, it has been utilized for its insulation properties, for example, in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. However, it also can be considered as a wide bandgap semiconductor possessing very large electrical resistivity. The conductivity of various silica films has been studied since the mid-nineteenth century, usually assuming the presence of ionic conductivity. However, in the sense of a wide bandgap semiconductor, the temperature dependence of the resistivity, which ranges over more than four orders of magnitude, can be accurately explained by normal semiconductor behavior under the presumed presence of a deep electron trap/donor residing ∼2.3 eV below the conduction band edge. That is, the conductance is determined by electron motion and not by ions. Experiments have studied the transport of injected electrons (and holes) which are consistent with this viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {The omnipresence of polarized light on the surface of the earth, a result of atmospheric scattering, underscores the significance of detecting this light and extracting valuable information regarding the phase and polarization angle. In recent years, there has been a surge in research on polarization-sensitive photodetectors that utilize anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) materials. The essence of these 2D polarization-sensitive photodetectors is rooted in the anisotropic characteristics that arise from the asymmetric crystal lattice of the 2D materials in question. This anisotropy is manifested in both optical and electrical behaviors due to the asymmetrical nature of the crystal structure. This article systematically categorizes anisotropic 2D materials and offers an insightful overview of their crystal structures. It also introduces various optical and electrical characterization techniques designed to elucidate the anisotropic properties of these materials. The focus of the article then shifts to detailing the current state of research in the realm of anisotropic 2D material-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors. It provides a comprehensive description of the working principles behind polarization-sensitive photodetectors with different structural designs, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that enable their polarization sensitivity. In conclusion, the article summarizes the findings of this review, highlighting the advancements and challenges in the field. Additionally, this review proposes several forward-looking recommendations to guide the future trajectory of research and development in the domain of 2D material-based polarization-sensitive photodetectors.},

  abstract = {Mnemonic networks are cyclic catalytic networks of monomeric enzymes that exhibit kinetic cooperativity as departures of the mean velocity from the hyperbolic, Michaelis–Menten-like response. In addition, such networks admit a hysteretic response when conformational fluctuations are slow compared to the catalytic rate. Here, we show how these fluctuation-driven effects emerge from the underlying stochasticity in the network. We use the chemical master equation to study the stochastic kinetics of mnemonic networks, which, in their minimal form, include a pair of conformers and triangular reaction pathways. We introduce statistical measures that are conditional on the turnovers to comprehensively analyze molecular fluctuations in the transient and stationary states of these networks. In the transient state, temporal correlations between enzyme turnovers lead to an inequivalence between number and temporal fluctuations, yielding a hysteretic response of the mean velocity to substrates. The transient relaxes to a stationary state with independent and identically distributed turnovers and equality between number and temporal fluctuations. This state is a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) when the Kolmogorov loop criterion is not satisfied, leading to the emergence of kinetic cooperativity. The symmetry of the number correlation functions allows us to distinguish between the absence of cooperativity in equilibrium and the accidental vanishing of cooperativity in a NESS. We conclude that memory and hysteresis are transient effects while kinetic cooperativity emerges as the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic irreversibility of the NESS in a network with cyclic reaction pathways.},

The results indicate that dsRNA unwinds when stretched, accompanied by a linear increase in helical rise and helical diameter. Then, we utilized the normal modes, which are linear combinations of helical modes, to elucidate the underlying mechanism of dsRNA unwinding from an energetic perspective. On the other hand, we employed a stiffness matrix based on a rigid base pair model to examine the base-pair dependence of twist elasticity for dsRNA, as well as stretch elasticities with respect to the helical rise and helical diameter. The results show that the force induces variations in the local elasticities and their couplings of dsRNA, which are closely related to the distributions of base pairs. The mean stretch and twist elasticities can be considered as constants within the measurement uncertainties; however, their couplings demonstrate a slight linear dependency on applied force.},

  abstract = {Dimerization and subsequent aggregation of polymers and biopolymers often occur under nonequilibrium conditions. When the initial state of the polymer is not collapsed, or the final folded native state, the dynamics of dimerization can follow a course sensitive to both the initial conditions and the conformational dynamics. Here, we study the dimerization process by using computer simulations and analytical theory, where the two monomeric polymer chains are in the elongated state and are initially placed at a separation distance, d 0 . Subsequent dynamics lead to the concurrent processes of collapse, dimerization, and/or escape. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model of the polymer to capture certain aspects of the dimerization process. At separations d 0 much shorter than the length of the monomeric polymer, the dimerization could happen fast and irreversibly from the partly extended polymer state itself. At an initial separation larger than a critical distance, d c , the polymer collapse precedes dimerization , and a significant number of single polymers do not dimerize within the time scale of simulations. To quantify these competitions, we introduce several time-dependent order parameters, namely, (i) the time-dependent radius of gyration R G ( t ) of individual polymers describing the conformational state of the polymer, (ii) a center-to-center of mass distance parameter R MM , and (iii) a time dependent overlap function Q ( t ) between the two monomeric polymers, mimicking the contact order parameter popular in protein folding. In order to better quantify the findings, we perform a theoretical analysis to capture the stochastic processes of collapse and dimerization by using the dynamical disorder model.},

  abstract = {Buoyancy-driven convection currents arise from temperature gradients in thermal frontal polymerization (FP) when the spatially localized polymerization reaction travels perpendicularly to the gravity field. We propose a theoretical study of the system dynamics under adiabatic conditions. The polymer and the reactant mixture are considered to be in the same liquid phase, but the viscosity can increase with the degree of polymerization. We find that the reaction zone propagates as a hot spot-like pattern with a broken symmetry in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Furthermore, the system can reach an asymptotic dynamics characterized by a front with a steady shape that propagates at constant speed with a steady vortex surrounding it. As the strength of the vortex is increased, either by decreasing the reactants’ viscosity or by increasing the layer’s thickness, we observe a transition between (i) a passive regime predicted by pure reaction–diffusion and hydrodynamic models and (ii) an active chemo-hydrodynamic regime where such models separately break down. In the active regime (ii), the front speed decreases as convection intensifies. By means of a scaling analysis, we explain how hydrodynamic currents might lower the velocity of a polymerization wave. As the viscosity of the polymer is enlarged, the flow is shifted ahead of the reaction zone and becomes more symmetrical with respect to the middle of the system, as recently observed in solid–liquid FP experiments [Y.

This new structure has been derived using an ab initio density functional theory methodology and focusing on the agreement between the experimental and theoretical x-ray diffraction patterns. An extensive study has been performed to analyze the possible conformations that the polymeric strand can adopt in its crystalline form, leading to 60 initial crystalline structures. Due to thermal motion, which cannot be easily tackled with the ab initio methodology, and small inaccuracies, which are intrinsic to this calculation method, the theoretical unit cell dimensions can slightly differ from those obtained in the crystallization experiments. Thus, a structural refinement method has been employed to overcome these discrepancies and procure a crystalline structure whose x-ray diffraction pattern is consistent with the experimental one. For the proposed crystalline structure of PBF, both the powder diffraction pattern and the fiber diffraction diagram show a remarkable agreement with those available in the literature.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase. Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.},

Distinct dry GB and TJ energies and GB widths are considered in contrast to the earlier phase-field studies, which assumed identical properties for the dry GBs and TJs and are far from reality. The strong effects of the intrinsic length scales, including the dry GB widths and grain size, on the temperatures of barrierless transformations between the solid, premelt (an intermediate stationary state between solid and melt with a degree of disorder) and melt, their nucleation induced by the GB network, kinetics, and complex microstructures evolution are explored, which was still missing in the literature. The thermodynamic processes involved in the melting of polycrystalline solids, which include the jump-like (discontinuous) appearance of premelt or melt pockets in the TJ regions, followed by premelting and melting of the connected GBs, curvature-driven shrinking of the grains surrounded by the melt pools and their jump-like melting at critical temperatures, all occurring at temperatures below the bulk melting point, are revealed. The reverse transformation (solidification) of the molten GB network and the bistability regime, where the temperatures for solid → premelt and premelt → solid transformations differ and yield thermal hysteresis, are studied.

  abstract = {Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors have garnered significant attention due to their high power and energy densities, as well as the abundance of sodium reserves. However, the mismatch between anode and cathode dynamics is the biggest barrier to improving their performance. To address this issue, we propose a strategy for the preparation of porous MXene by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-controlled etching to solve the capacity degradation and ion diffusion limitation, which are caused by van der Waals forces between MXene nanosheets. This approach facilitates the realization of three-dimensional ion channels with both vertical and horizontal pathways, significantly enhancing the availability of active sites and improving the ion diffusion rate. By adjusting the amount of oxidant, porous MXene (P-MXene-2) with an optimal pore size range was obtained. The assembled half-cell has a capacity of 180 mAh g −1 at a rate of 0.05 A g −1 . Furthermore, by combining a porous carbon cathode with porous MXene and electrolyte screening, a SIHC with a high energy density of 110.6 Wh kg −1 at 1000 W kg −1 and 71.1 Wh kg −1 at 20 kW kg −1 was successfully constructed.

The key gas-sensing characteristics concerning chemiresistive (CR) and field-effect transistor (FET) gas sensing have been thoroughly explored. The results show that Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N can work as either CR or FET gas-sensing materials for detecting H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 O, whereas B-C 2 N can work as a disposable gas sensor for O 2 , H 2 O, and NH 3 . Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N are the most selective toward O 2 and NH 3 , followed by CO and H 2 O in an oxygen- and ammonia-free environment, while B-C 2 N is the most selective toward H 2 O and NH 3 . More importantly, the adsorption strength of target molecule plays a critical role in gas-sensing mechanism as well as selectivity, recovery time, and sensitivity. This study offers theoretical perspectives on 2D hybrid carbon-based nanomaterials for efficient gas sensing.},

Highly polarized spin probes were produced in situ by the addition of muonium to the aromatic anions, and the muon and methylene proton hyperfine coupling constants (hfccs) of these radical anions were determined from the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonance fields in the ALC- μ SR spectra. The motionally averaged dipolar muon hfccs, | D μ ‖ | ⁠ , were determined from the width and amplitude of the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonances and used to estimate the extent of reorientational motion. The results are consistent with the counterions being electrostatically trapped near the oil/water interface of the surfactant bilayer and undergoing large amplitude anisotropic motion. This motion is generally more restricted in DODMAC bilayers compared with DHTAC, which is likely related to the relative flexibility of the headgroups to which the counterions are loosely bound. The motion of the ortho isomers is generally more restricted than the para isomers, while there is no obvious trend regarding the ethyl, chloro, and hydroxy substituents.},

This method probes large electron spin magnetization arisen from dynamic electron spin polarization (DEP), which remarkably enhances the EPR signal. DEP decays with the longitudinal spin relaxation time, which was observed by using the FID detection method. In the presence of a radical scavenger, the DEP decay time depends on both spin-lattice relaxation and the chemical reaction with the scavenger, the latter of which reduces radical concentration. The plots of DEP decay rates against the radical scavenger concentrations gave the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants for various radicals. This procedure was applied to determine the radical scavenging reaction rate constants of hydroxycyclohexyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, diphenylphosphinoyl, and α,α-dimethoxybenzyl radicals. The measured rate constants show good agreement with the previously reported values determined by using another method monitoring electron spin echo (ESE) decays of the radicals.

  abstract = {In the present work, we investigate the thermal conductivity ( κ ) of different core–shell nanowires using molecular dynamics simulation and Green–Kubo (EMD), imposing a temperature gradient (NEMD) and Müller-Plathe (rNEMD) approaches. We show that in GaAs@InAs nanowires, the interface effect becomes more significant than the nanowire cross-sectional geometry. In particular, κ decreases as the interface area increases, reaching a minimum, and then increases when the interface strain relaxes. This is particularly important for thermoelectric applications, where minimization of κ is desired. In particular, the different methods can predict minima at different core diameters without special considerations. In addition, the NEMD approach and, to a lesser extent, rNEMD tend to overestimate the κ values, which cannot be corrected with the methods available in the literature. By analyzing the temperature and length dependence, (I) we show that interfacial scattering primarily involves phonon–phonon interactions, which mainly affect low-energy modes, a mechanism that effectively reduces κ at low temperatures. (II) The Langevin thermostat tends to pump low-energy modes in the NEMD approach, but this effect decreases with longer nanowires. (III) Energy exchanges in rNEMD stimulate high-energy phonons, derived from the saturation of κ at a much shorter nanowire length than NEMD. These findings highlight the challenges of accurately determining κ of ultrathin core–shell nanowires, where only the EMD approach provides precise results. With the recognition of non-equilibrium contributions to the overestimation of κ by NEMD and rNEMD, these methods can still provide valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying thermal transport mechanisms.},

Notably, a smaller IL amount is needed to prevent 1-butene adsorption as compared to 1,3-butadiene adsorption, leading to a selectivity window, in which 1,3-butadiene still can be adsorbed while 1-butene cannot. With the aim to evaluate whether this is a general behavior, we study an IL with a longer alkyl chain at the cation, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]), and an IL with a different anion, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C 8 C 1 Im][PF 6 ]). Indeed, we observe a selectivity window for all ILs and thus demonstrate that this concept also applies for other ILs with different chain lengths and anions. Nevertheless, there are pronounced differences for the three ILs in terms of the IL coverages required for full blocking and the width of the selectivity window. Different explanations are discussed, e.g., the structure of the IL layer and the interaction strengths of olefins and ILs with the substrate.},

  abstract = {Aluminum (Al) is a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and low volume expansibility. However, scalable fabrication of nanostructured Al still faces a great challenge. In addition, the lithium storage performance of Al anode materials always encounters a severe strike within a dozen discharge/charge cycles, and such an abnormal behavior of the Al anode material remains enigmatic. Herein, a mechanochemistry method without using any solvent is developed to achieve scalable production of Al nanoparticles and the morphology of the obtained Al nanoparticles could be regulated using Ketjen black (KB). KB with a chain-like structure could regulate the Al crystal growth process and the aggregation of Al nanoparticles during the solid-phase reaction, shortening the electron transfer path among Al crystals, ultimately activating the lithium storage behavior of nanostructured Al. Initial discharge/charge capacities of 630.6 and 402.0 mA h g −1 were achieved at 50 mA g −1 ; unfortunately, the nanostructured Al still suffered from rapid deterioration of lithium storage performance. Comprehensive analysis demonstrated that the raised energy barrier of LiAl formation and the slow lithium diffusion kinetics in the Al matrix may be the main factors destroying the lithium storage performance of the Al anode material. This work provided more evidence for illustrating the lithium storage behavior of the Al anode.},

  abstract = {Quantifying thermodynamics, structural, and dynamical properties of brine confined in clay pores is critical for a variety of geo-energy applications, including underground hydrogen storage (UHS) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are applied here to study aqueous NaCl brines within 10-Å kaolinite slit pores. NaCl concentrations are chosen at 5, 10, 12.5, and 15 wt. %, all below the solubility limit and high enough to provide statistically relevant information. The distribution of the ions within the nanopores is found not to be homogeneous. Explicitly, Na + cations, preferentially attracted to the siloxane surface, accumulate in regions with low water density, whereas Cl − anions, attracted to the gibbsite surface of kaolinite, are found within the hydration layers. Confinement affects the properties of ions, with ion pairing being more pronounced within the pore than in bulk aqueous solutions at similar temperatures, pressures, and compositions. Conversely, the ions affect the properties of confined water. For example, the lifetime of water–water hydrogen bonds in confinement is shortened within the hydration shells; increasing salinity from 5 to 12.5 wt. % reduces the likelihood of water density fluctuations near the kaolinite surfaces, although when the NaCl concentration rises from 12.5 to 15 wt. %, Cl − anions enhance the likelihood of density fluctuations for the hydration layer near the gibbsite surface. The simulated molecular trajectories are studied further to extract diffusion coefficients. While confinement in the kaolinite nanopore reduces the mobility of all species, non-monotonic trends are observed as a function of salt concentration. The trends seem associated with the likelihood of ion pairing. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients for the cations are predicted to be higher than those for the anions, which is contrary to what is typically observed in bulk brines. Because density fluctuations are correlated with properties such as the solubility of gases in confined water, our observations may have important implications for geo-energy applications such as UHS and CCS.},

The traditional Boltzmann transport equation method is highly accurate but limited by the low-order phonon scattering model, which makes it difficult to resolve the high-order scattering effects of low symmetry layered materials. The classical molecular dynamics calculation is efficient but lacks accuracy due to the missing multi-component potential function. In this study, we develop a strategy to predict the thermal conductivity of K 0.8 Li 0.27 Ti 1.73 O 4 (KLTO), a model of layered oxides by machine-learning using a deep neural network model to acquire the interatomic potential of KLTO. The deep learning potential (DLP) is in excellent agreement with density functional theory in predicting atomic force, energy, and elastic properties. In addition, the calculated out-of-plane thermal conductivity values based on the DLP (0.37 W m −1 K −1 ) are close to experimental results (0.28 W m −1 K −1 ). This machine-learning framework for constructing interatomic potentials can be extended to other layered materials, offering a promising approach for advancing the theoretical study of such systems.},

  abstract = {Cyanogen chloride (CNCl) is a toxic chemical that poses significant risks to human health and the environment; therefore, its level must be accurately monitored. Herein, the adsorption of CNCl by transition metal-doped fluorinated diamanes (F-diamanes) has been extensively studied via first-principles calculations. Key parameters such as adsorption energies, charge transfer amounts, bandgaps, sensitivity, densities of states, projected density of states, charge density differences, and recovery time were systematically analyzed. Results reveal that monometallic doping significantly enhances CNCl adsorption, with increases in adsorption energy by 164%–368% and charge transfer by 1234%–1571%, particularly in the AuFD-CNCl, AgFD-CNCl, and CuFD-CNCl systems, which demonstrated improved sensing performances. Similarly, bimetallic co-doping further strengthened adsorption, with energy enhancements of 277%–309% and charge transfer increases of 1238%–1505%. Au-CuFD-CNCl, Au-AgFD-CNCl, and Cu-AgFD-CNCl systems also showed superior sensing performances. Meanwhile, the recovery time of CNCl molecules on the AuFD, AgFD, Au-CuFD, and Au-AgFD surfaces was drastically reduced to acceptable levels at 279–412 K, leading to their desorption. Therefore, these four systems exhibited excellent reversibility properties, suggesting their applicability in gas-sensing applications. This work can facilitate the applications of doped F-diamanes in environmental conservation, energy storage, and chemical engineering.},

  abstract = {In this study, a solution system of KCl–NH 4 Cl–NH 3 –H 2 O with different mass fractions was prepared at room temperature using x-ray scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. From x-ray scattering, it was obtained that the peak near Q = 2.50 Å −1 in the F ( Q ) function changed from a flat-topped blunt peak to a bimodal peak as the concentration of ammonia increased. This change indicated that increased ammonia altered the hydrogen bonding network within the mixed solution. In the G ( r ) function, the peak near 3.25 Å enhances with the increase in ammonia concentration, suggesting a higher occurrence of N(NH 4 + )–N(NH 3 ) interactions. Raman spectroscopy findings demonstrated that in the KCl–NH 4 Cl aqueous mixture, the area of DDAA-type hydrogen bonds increased as KCl concentration decreased and NH 4 Cl concentration increased. This suggests that KCl disrupts DDAA-type hydrogen bonds more significantly than NH 4 Cl. The situation was reversed when ammonia was added to the system, implying that KCl damages the DDAA-type hydrogen bonding structure less than NH 4 Cl when NH 3 is present in the solution. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the coordination number of K–Cl increases with ammonia concentration, as ammonia’s lone pair of electrons can bind to NH 4 + to stabilize the [NH 4 (H 2 O) m−n (NH 3 ) n ] + complex. This study elucidates the underlying microscopic mechanisms behind the decrease in KCl solubility and the increase in NH 4 Cl solubility upon increased ammonia.},

  abstract = {Two main frameworks are commonly used to describe electrolyte solutions: the non-primitive model, which rigorously accounts for all interactions between ions and solvent molecules; and the primitive model, which treats the solvent as a dielectric continuum, only describing ion–ion interactions explicitly. The primitive model offers simple Helmholtz energy expressions, including the Debye–Hückel (DH) equation, the primitive mean spherical approximation (MSA), and the Born theory of solvation. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of primitive model approaches by comparing their Helmholtz energies with data from molecular simulations obtained for non-primitive model electrolyte solutions. We model electrolyte solutions as mixtures of equally sized, charged, and (non-polarizable) dipolar Lennard-Jones particles. Using thermodynamic integration, we isolate the Helmholtz energy contributions related to solvent–solvent, ion–solvent, and ion–ion interactions. Molecular simulations are performed across two temperatures and two densities, a range of charges, dipole moments, and ion mole fractions (0.005 ≤ x ions ≤ 0.05). Our results show that while the primitive model expressions provide a qualitatively reasonable description of electrolyte solutions, they systematically underestimate the Helmholtz energy contributions associated with ion–solvent and ion–ion interactions. Achieving quantitative agreement requires empirical adjustments to the Born radius. Notably, the optimized Born radii are significantly larger than the actual ion sizes used in the molecular simulations, questioning the primitive model’s applicability. This work presents rigorous benchmarks for the use of MSA, DH, and Born theories, along with molecular simulation data for non-primitive model electrolytes. These benchmarks provide insights for refining existing models and advancing the development of new equations of state for electrolyte solutions.},

The SAAP + FH-1 combination also improves the prediction of other thermodynamic properties. However, the accurate determination of enthalpy, heat capacity, isothermal compressibility, isochoric pressure coefficient, and isobaric thermal expansion coefficient requires the addition of a quantum correction to the kinetic energy (QCKE). The QCKE is a post-simulation contribution to the thermodynamic properties of quantum fluids and, as such, can be used to improve the accuracy of any predictions using an intermolecular potential. The addition of QCKE to the SAAP + FH-1 potential results in values for the thermodynamic properties that are close to reference data for hydrogen at temperatures greater than 40 K and pressures up to 100 MPa.},

To advance the understanding of their melt processing and glass forming ability, we report the atomic structure of molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 over 1770–2630 K, which spans the equilibrium and supercooled liquid regimes. The melt density at T m = 2283 K is 5.50 g cm −3 , measured via silhouette imaging of electrostatically levitated drops over 1010–2420 K. Four separate structure measurements were made with aerodynamically levitated melts using x-ray and neutron diffraction with isotope substitution of Yb ( 172 Yb, 174 Yb, or nat Yb). Empirical potential structure refinement models were developed, which are in excellent agreement with the experiments. Coordination environments for Al–O are predominantly 4- and 5-coordinate, with a mean coordination of n AlO = 4.43(8), while Yb–O environments mostly range from 5- to 8-coordinate, with n YbO = 6.26(8). The cation–oxygen polyhedra are connected primarily by corner-sharing, with edge-sharing constituting up to ∼1/3 of the connectivity among polyhedra with Yb or higher-coordinated Al–O. Structurally, the –Al–O– network in molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 appears conducive to glass formation: n OAl = 1.85(3), there are 1.86 AlO x –AlO x connections per Al atom (e.g., a mixture of Q 3 and Q 4 units), and the modal ring size is six cations. These characterize a network that is somewhat less constrained compared to SiO 2 glass, yet Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 cannot be quenched into crystal-free glass. Aluminum garnet compositions with larger rare earth cations do form glass, so these characterizations help reveal the structural characteristics corresponding to the limit of glass forming ability in rare earth aluminates.},

To better understand the physics determining the photoswitching performance, a deeper insight into the positions of the relevant potential energy surfaces and the molecular structure of the 5 MC state is needed.

The analysis of the TR-XSS data is supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics calculations. The quintet state lifetime is determined to vary by more than a factor of 10 (from 1.5 to 16 ns) based on the electron withdrawing/donating properties of the substituting group.

  abstract = {The ultrafast excited-state dynamics of the E and Z isomers of a push–pull nitroazobenzene containing an octupolar bis(4′-tert-butylbiphenyl-4-yl)aminophenyl electron donor group were studied with transient absorption (TA) and TA anisotropy. A comprehensive study with two excitation wavelengths and a broadband white-light continuum probe (400–1400 nm) has determined that a torsional isomerization mechanism is the most probable for both isomers. This has shed light on the excited state behavior of the elusive push–pull Z isomer, which has its properties mostly predicted by simulations and systematically lacks experimental observations. Meanwhile, another unproductive relaxation pathway, associated with a symmetric bending motion, was found only for the E isomer. When relaxing through this pathway, the molecule encounters a potential barrier in the ground state, which requires significant structural reorganization before full relaxation. This local minimum can be more general than expected and may be behind unsolved issues in the literature of azobenzenes.},

  abstract = {An uncertainty-driven active learning strategy was employed to achieve efficient point sampling for full-dimension potential energy surface constructions. Model uncertainty is defined as the weighted square energy difference between two neural network models, and the local maximums of uncertainty would be added to the training set by two criteria. A two-step sampling procedure was introduced to reduce the computational costs of expansive double-precision neural network training. A reference potential energy surface (PES) of the 6-D H 2 O–He system was constructed first by the MLRNet model with a weighted Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.028 cm −1 . The full-dimension long-range function was fitted by a pruned basis expansion method. The current sampling method is reliable for the long-range switched fundamental invariant neural network (LS-FI-NN) to construct spectroscopically accurate PES, where the single precision model achieves a test set RMSE of 0.3253 cm −1 with 472 fitting points and the double precision model is 0.0710 cm −1 with only 613 points. In comparison, the MLRNet requires 652 points to reach a similar accuracy. However, the MLRNet, with fewer parameters, shows lower training errors across all sampling cycles and lower test errors in the first few cycles, indicating its potential with an appropriate sampling procedure. The spectroscopic calculations were performed to validate the accuracy of PESs. The energy levels of the double precision LS-FI-NN showed great agreement with the reference PES’s results, with only 0.0161 and 0.0044 cm −1 average errors for vibrational levels and the band origin shifts.},

  abstract = {In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the coalescence-induced jumping behavior of moving and stationary droplets at the nanoscale on superhydrophobic surfaces. The results show that the initial velocity of the droplets significantly influences the coalescence time and jumping characteristics. As the initial velocity increases, the coalescence time decreases, and the horizontal velocity increases, suggesting that controlling the initial velocity can adjust droplet motion behavior. In terms of energy conversion, the total energy conversion rate remains relatively constant at lower initial velocities but increases significantly as the velocity rises. This is primarily due to the reduced coalescence time and viscous dissipation caused by the increased initial kinetic energy, allowing more energy to be converted into the kinetic energy of jumping. The energy conversion rate in the horizontal direction increases with initial velocity, while in the vertical direction, it tends to decrease. This study deepens the understanding of coalescence-induced jumping phenomena at the nanoscale and provides a theoretical basis for engineering applications, showing that droplet behavior can be effectively modulated by controlling the initial velocity.},

Our theory successfully predicts the two reaction channels in iodomethane photodissociation that lead to I ( P 3 / 2 2 ) and I * ( P 1 / 2 2 ) products, showing excellent agreement with experimental delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals at large pump–probe delays. The theoretical kinetic energy release at small delays depends significantly on the choice of ionic states. By accounting for internal rotation, the kinetic energies of individual fragments in bromoiodomethane align well with experimental results.

  abstract = {Multidimensional optical spectroscopy observes transient excitation dynamics through time evolution of spectral correlations. Its action-detected variants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected spectra is the presence of a stationary background of the so-called incoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a product of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state signal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected pump–probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent mixing arises from efficient exciton–exciton annihilation. In this work, we demonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal symmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent subtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive the expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the pulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we show both analytically and numerically, the difference signal constructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of incoherent mixing and highlights the excited-state dynamics. We further verify the approach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer and the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria. The approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump–probe spectroscopy without experimental modifications and is independent of the studied system, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular complexes.},

  abstract = {Area-selective atomic layer deposition (area-selective ALD) has been extensively studied because of its versatility in nanotechnological applications. The priority focus in area-selective ALD is to achieve the desired selectivity; thus, most studies to date have been concentrated on the reaction mechanism of ALD on growth/nongrowth substrates or the development of novel methodologies to resolve the challenges associated with its implementation in high-volume manufacturing. In this study, we performed area-selective ALD of SiO 2 on SiO 2 , where SiO 2 was not grown on SiN x , and suggested area-selective ALD approaches that could simultaneously enhance selectivity and film quality. An NH 3 plasma treatment was applied to functionalize the SiN x surface with more Si–NH bonds, which exhibited low reactivity toward Si precursors. Although the SiO 2 surface was also functionalized with Si–NH bonds, it was not fully converted into Si–NH because of its thermodynamic nature at low temperatures. Consequently, the results showed that NH 3 plasma pretreatment was effective in increasing selectivity. Therefore, we performed a layer-by-layer NH 3 plasma treatment during the ALD of SiO 2 to deposit high-quality films without losing selectivity. The SiO 2 film was densified, as confirmed by x-ray reflection spectra without nitrogen impurity incorporation. Electrical property measurements of metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors confirmed that this approach enabled simultaneous selectivity and SiO 2 film-quality enhancement.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction almost three decades ago, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has evolved into a mature and powerful technique to reveal the inner workings of quantum systems with high temporal and spectral resolution. In general, this technique can isolate different contributions to the nonlinear response and provides access to different dynamical quantum pathways of the system evolution. Such isolation of pathways can be achieved in different experimental geometries. In its original, fully noncollinear implementation, directional phase matching allows for such signal isolation, while in the modern commonly employed pump–probe geometry, experimentally challenging phase-cycling schemes are employed. Here, we show how rephasing, non-rephasing, and zero- and double-quantum 2DES signals can be isolated in the pump–probe geometry without a need for phase-cycling. For this, we utilize established causality restrictions of the nonlinear response, allowing us to separate the different contributions in the spectral domain. We demonstrate this using data recorded for a molecular J-aggregate, acting as an effective three-level system. This approach bridges the gap between the capabilities of shaper-based and fully noncollinear 2DES and experimentally simpler implementations, such as those based on birefringent common-path interferometers.},

  abstract = {It is now well established that the transition state of a chemical reaction is not a single, static structure but rather a distribution of configurations. However, the implications of this distributed nature remain incompletely characterized, particularly for quantum proton and hydride transfer reactions, where variations in donor–acceptor separations at the transition state are key: they can determine whether or not tunneling contributes to the transfer. Consequently, the transition state’s characterization critically depends on the chosen reaction coordinate, and several geometry-based and energy-based coordinates have been proposed for empirical valence bond and hybrid QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations of such reactions. Here, we systematically evaluate these coordinates, using a general analytic model for proton- and hydride-transfer reactions alongside important aspects of the enzymatic hydride transfer in formate dehydrogenase as a case study. Our analysis reveals significant limitations of common geometry-based and vertical energy gap coordinates, which often fail to isolate environmental effects and can bias the description of transition states. To address these issues, we propose an equilibrium energy difference coordinate that excludes the rapid fluctuations of the transferring quantum proton or hydride, focusing instead on the environment’s polarization. Additionally, we demonstrate that the broad distribution of transition state configurations implies that key reaction properties, such as rate constants and kinetic isotope effects, may not always report on the same subset of transition state configurations. This insight helps resolve some mechanistic ambiguities and highlights the importance of carefully selecting reaction coordinates for simulating reaction dynamics (especially for quantum particle transfers) in enzymatic and condensed-phase chemistry.},

Our method can access nucleation rates up to 50 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported results. We examine three cases: homogeneous pure system, system with static impurities, and system with mobile impurities, where impurities are defined as sites with zero interactions with neighboring spins (the spin value of impurities is set to 0). Classical nucleation theory holds across the entire temperature range studied in the paper, for both the homogeneous system and the static impurity case.

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In Paper I [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in Paper II [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.},

  abstract = {We benchmark the accuracy of various trajectory-based non-adiabatic methods in simulating the polariton relaxation dynamics under the collective coupling regime. The Holstein–Tavis–Cummings Hamiltonian is used to describe the hybrid light–matter system of N molecules coupled to a single cavity mode. We apply various recently developed trajectory-based methods to simulate the population relaxation dynamics by initially exciting the upper polariton state and benchmark the results against populations computed from exact quantum dynamical propagation using the hierarchical equations of motion approach. In these benchmarks, we have systematically varied the number of molecules N , light–matter detunings, and the light–matter coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that the symmetrical quasi-classical method with γ correction and spin-mapping linearized semi-classical approaches yield more accurate polariton population dynamics than traditional mixed quantum-classical methods, such as the Ehrenfest and surface hopping techniques.},

  abstract = {This paper brings attention back to discussions about the use of equilibrium thermostats for nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. It argues that, due to the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, the justification for using equilibrium thermostats for nonequilibrium simulations is inherited only by cases in which the perturbation is small enough for the perturbed system to behave like the unperturbed equilibrium system. In the process, this paper categorizes models of external perturbations in molecular dynamics as either responsive—i.e., perturbations that impose a force—or directive—i.e., perturbations that impose a trajectory. Since directive perturbations have not been studied enough in the literature but are becoming more relevant, their effects on simple perturbed thermostatted systems are considered. Finally, using a perturbed two-point harmonic oscillator as well as a driven particle immersed in a simple Lennard-Jones fluid, it gives an approximation for the limit of justified equilibrium thermostat use for perturbed systems. This paper hopes to inspire further research in the fields of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {Iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles have been extensively studied as T 2 contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. The theory of nuclear magnetic relaxation induced by superparamagnetic nanoparticles has been validated by numerous experimental studies in the case of spherical particles. Recently, several studies focused on the synthesis of cubic nanoparticles. Some of them reported significantly higher relaxivities compared to their spherical counterpart and attributed this increase to their specific shapes. This work investigates the impact of cube-shaped nanoparticles on nuclear magnetic relaxation through Monte Carlo methods. Transverse relaxation at high static magnetic field is simulated by modeling the proton diffusion in the magnetic field generated by a cubic or a spherical nanoparticle. The results indicate that, in the case of magnetite nanoparticles, there is no significant difference between both shapes for sizes above 30 nm when particles are compared at equal volumes and magnetization. Below this size, a −40%–15% variation of the relaxation rates is predicted for the cubic case compared to the spherical case. These results are explained using general relaxation models that incorporate the distribution of the magnetic field generated by the nanoparticles. The simulation predictions are compared to some experimental results from the literature, revealing that, in some cases, the magnetic field specific to the nanoparticle shape alone cannot explain the observed increase in the relaxation rate of cubic nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Gas diffusion in graphene nanochannels is pivotal for applications such as gas sensing and membrane separation, where nanoscale confinement introduces unique transport phenomena. Unlike bulk-phases, diffusion in graphene nanochannels is significantly influenced by adsorption, which modifies density distributions and alters diffusivity behavior. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are combined with a theoretical framework to comprehensively investigate gas diffusion under varying pressures and channel heights. A modified Chapman–Enskog model, derived from atomistic Lennard-Jones potential parameters, is proposed to account for the effects of confinement. Simulation results reveal that gas diffusivity decreases with increasing gas-phase pressure and decreasing channel height due to enhanced density in the nanochannels. Interestingly, for ultra-narrow channels ( h ≲ 0.7 nm), the diffusivity correction factor exhibits non-monotonic behavior, initially decreasing but subsequently increasing due to overlapping repulsive potential fields. The proposed model integrates adsorption effects through density predictions based on the Boltzmann distribution and effectively predicts gas diffusivities with relative errors of less than 13%, even under strong confinement. These findings highlight the critical interplay between adsorption and confinement in shaping gas transport within graphene nanochannels. The theoretical model provides a predictive tool for designing graphene-based gas separation and sensing devices, offering fundamental insights for optimizing their performance.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer processes are ubiquitous in nature and intensely investigated. The investigations concentrate on the transfer of small to intermediate sized energies. Here, we pose the question of whether the transfer of large energies, where relativistic effects play a central role, can be efficient. At large energies, the process leads to ionization of the environment, i.e., it is the interatomic (or intermolecular) Coulombic decay (ICD) process. To that end, we derive asymptotic expressions for the ICD amplitude by employing the Dirac–Breit Hamiltonian and expanding the frequency dependent Coulomb–Breit interaction between the electrons of the donor and those of the acceptor in powers of the inverse distance between their centers of mass. Expressions are separately derived for the two popular Feynman and Coulomb gauges. At long range, the two expressions have a different appearance but are proven to be equivalent. The derived energy transfer rate at long range shows that when the donor is embedded in an environment, the transfer can be highly efficient. A key is that the radiative lifetime of the donor is extremely short (it can be in the attosecond, 10 −18 s, regime), and the x-ray emission typically dominates by far Auger decay (also called Auger–Meitner decay), and the ICD can quench this emission. This contrasts with the situation at small to intermediate sized energies, where the radiative lifetime is much smaller and Auger decay (if the channel is open) dominates. In these cases, the major contribution to ICD comes from the neighbors nearby.},

  abstract = {Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations, provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size, making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl 3 in water.},

To test the reliability of the theoretical development, we form three sets of non-covalent complexes from the literature with a total of fifty-one systems. The former set of complexes includes many different types of non-covalent interactions, the second set consists of prototypical non-covalent complexes and three biologically relevant interactions between DNA base pairs, and the third set comprises halogen bonding complexes. We determined the charge-transfer energy contributions and the total interaction energies of all these complexes. The calculated charge-transfer energies are in very good agreement with the ones calculated using the fragment-based Hirshfeld methodology, which has been proven to be reliable.

  abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell–Schrödinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. In addition, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach—an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using simple dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.},

  abstract = {Introducing heavy atoms, or replacing atoms with heavier ones, is a routine approach for accelerating spin-flipping photophysical processes. However, predicting its impact on phosphorescence efficiency is not straightforward. Herein, we report an unexpected consequence of bromine-to-iodine substitution in a bromothienyl diketone derivative, TIPS-BrTn , that exhibits outstanding room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in cyclohexane solution. Contrary to our expectation, the iodo-congener TIPS-ITn exhibited feeble photoluminescence, which we confirmed as RTP by ultrafast spectroscopy. Further experimental and theoretical studies revealed that, in the T 1 state, an excited-state symmetry breaking occurred on TIPS-ITn while TIPS-BrTn preserved the centrosymmetric geometry. We identified the driving force for the symmetry breaking as an intramolecular two-center three-electron bonding interaction between iodine and carbonyl oxygen in the (n,π*) excited state. Consequently, while the direct T 1 –S 0 spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in TIPS-BrTn is symmetry-forbidden and zero, that of TIPS-ITn is non-zero due to the loss of centrosymmetry, thereby accelerating nonradiative T 1 –S 0 decay to diminish the RTP. Importantly, the phosphorescence rate constant is not solely dictated by the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC; instead, it can be rationalized by the intensity borrowing from higher singlet states. Thus, our work highlights the importance of controlling molecular symmetry, which could suppress the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC and lead to a preferential acceleration of radiative decay over nonradiative decay for achieving efficient RTP.},

  abstract = {Structural relaxation in supercooled liquids is non-exponential. In susceptibility representation, χ ″( ν ), the spectral shape of the structural relaxation is observed as an asymmetrically broadened peak with a ν 1 low- and ν − β high-frequency behavior. In this perspective article, we discuss common notions, recent results, and open questions regarding the spectral shape of the structural relaxation. In particular, we focus on the observation that a high-frequency behavior of ν −1/2 appears to be a generic feature in a broad range of supercooled liquids. Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. In addition, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules. Finally, we discuss the open questions regarding potential physical origins of the generic ν −1/2 behavior and the evolution of the spectral shape toward higher temperatures.},

  abstract = {Simulating many-body open quantum systems (OQSs) is challenging due to the intricate interplay between the system and its environment, resulting in strong quantum correlations in both space and time. This Perspective presents an overview of recently developed theoretical methods using artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing (QC) to simulate the dynamics of these systems. We briefly introduce the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization, which provides a single master equation suitable for representation by neural quantum states or quantum circuits. The promising performance of AI- and QC-based approaches is demonstrated through preliminary research on simulating the quantum dissipative dynamics of many-body OQSs. We also discuss the limitations and future developments of these methods, which hold promise for overcoming the computational challenges associated with many-body OQS dynamics.},

More precisely, when a given Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with the unknown integrable potential interacts with δ -function potentials, we obtain a family of perturbation problems, called point interaction models in quantum mechanics. Then, only depending on the first eigenvalues of these perturbed problems, we define and study the first eigenvalue function , by which the desired potential can be expressed explicitly and uniquely. As by-products, using the analytic function theoretic tools, we also generalize several fundamental theorems of classical Sturm-Liouville problems to measure differential equations with non-trivial positive integrable weights, which provide the possibility of the further study of inverse spectral problems for more general measure differential equations.},

The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion yield Tsallis relative entropy as the leading-order term when q is interpreted as an entropic parameter. Furthermore, higher-order expansion coefficients naturally introduce new divergence measures, extending Tsallis relative entropy through a one-parameter generalisation.

We obtain two sets of results. First, we use strong Whitney topologies on spaces of Lorentzian metrics on a manifold M , in the spirit of Lerner’s [Commun. Math. Phys. 32 , 19 (1973)], and obtain that while the set of singular Lorentzian metrics around a fiducial one possessing a weakly trapped submanifold Σ is not really generic, it is nevertheless prevalent in a sense we define, and thus still quite “large” in this sense. We prove versions of that result both for the case when Σ has codimension 2, and for the case of higher codimension. The second set of results explore a similar question, but now for initial data sets containing marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS). For this case, we use certain well-known infinite dimensional, Hilbert manifold structures on the space of initial data and use abstract functional-analytic methods based on the work of Biliotti, Javaloyes, and Piccione’s [Indiana Univ.

The idea is to first define an “elementary” channel Φ 2 and then to analyze when Φ Φ 2 − 1 is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way—which even yields an explicit factorization of Φ—is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors x , x ⊥ such that 〈 x ⊥ | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = 〈 x | K Φ K Φ ⊥ | x 〉 = { 0 } where K Φ is the Kraus subspace of Φ and K Φ ⊥ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application—if possible—results in a factorization of Φ into in some sense “simple” channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.},

The motion of electrons in the semiconductors is analyzed in the framework of the Kane two-band theory. Conditions are formulated for the envelope wave functions of the electrons on the contact plane. They generalize the Ben Daniel–Duke boundary condition which was formerly derived in a different manner. (Ben Daniel and Duke used the standard Schrödinger equation as an equation of the second order while our conditions can concern an equation of the n -th order, with the possibility that n tends to infinity.)},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce and analyze the Smith-Volterra-Cantor potential of power n , denoted as SVC ρ , n ⁠ . Bridging the gap between the general Cantor G C and Smith-Volterra-Cantor S V C systems, this novel potential offers a fresh perspective on Cantor-like potential systems within quantum mechanics that unify fractal and non-fractal potentials. Utilizing the Super Periodic Potential formalism, we derive the close form expression of the transmission probability T G ( k ). Notably, the system exhibits exceptionally sharp transmission resonances, a characteristic that distinguishes it from other quantum systems. Furthermore, the multifaceted transmission attributes of the SVC ρ , n are found to be critically dependent on both parameters, ρ and n , offering an intricate interplay that warrants deeper exploration. Our findings highlight a pronounced scaling behavior of reflection probability with k , which is underpinned by analytical derivations.},

In the special case where α = β and △ = 0, it is immediately seen that Q α α NH is unitarily equivalent to α 2 − 1 1 − 4 g 2 H 0 , g 2 p ⁠ . The purpose of this paper is to establish relationships between Q α β NH and H △ , g 2 p for the general cases △ &gt; 0 and α ≠ β , and to show the fiber decomposition of Q α β NH in terms of H △ , g 2 p ⁠ . We also construct Feynman–Kac formulas for e − t H △ , g 2 p and e − t Q α β NH ⁠ . It is then considered the asymptotic behaviors of the spectral zeta function ζ 2p ( s ) of H △ , g 2 p ⁠ .},

Finally, the regularity of the invariant measure is investigated, that is, the invariant measure is supported by a regular space.},
