  abstract = {Mnemonic networks are cyclic catalytic networks of monomeric enzymes that exhibit kinetic cooperativity as departures of the mean velocity from the hyperbolic, Michaelis–Menten-like response. In addition, such networks admit a hysteretic response when conformational fluctuations are slow compared to the catalytic rate. Here, we show how these fluctuation-driven effects emerge from the underlying stochasticity in the network. We use the chemical master equation to study the stochastic kinetics of mnemonic networks, which, in their minimal form, include a pair of conformers and triangular reaction pathways. We introduce statistical measures that are conditional on the turnovers to comprehensively analyze molecular fluctuations in the transient and stationary states of these networks. In the transient state, temporal correlations between enzyme turnovers lead to an inequivalence between number and temporal fluctuations, yielding a hysteretic response of the mean velocity to substrates. The transient relaxes to a stationary state with independent and identically distributed turnovers and equality between number and temporal fluctuations. This state is a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) when the Kolmogorov loop criterion is not satisfied, leading to the emergence of kinetic cooperativity. The symmetry of the number correlation functions allows us to distinguish between the absence of cooperativity in equilibrium and the accidental vanishing of cooperativity in a NESS. We conclude that memory and hysteresis are transient effects while kinetic cooperativity emerges as the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic irreversibility of the NESS in a network with cyclic reaction pathways.},

We used the helical rise and helical twist, as well as a newly defined helical diameter, to characterize the stretching and twisting of dsRNA. The results indicate that dsRNA unwinds when stretched, accompanied by a linear increase in helical rise and helical diameter. Then, we utilized the normal modes, which are linear combinations of helical modes, to elucidate the underlying mechanism of dsRNA unwinding from an energetic perspective. On the other hand, we employed a stiffness matrix based on a rigid base pair model to examine the base-pair dependence of twist elasticity for dsRNA, as well as stretch elasticities with respect to the helical rise and helical diameter. The results show that the force induces variations in the local elasticities and their couplings of dsRNA, which are closely related to the distributions of base pairs. The mean stretch and twist elasticities can be considered as constants within the measurement uncertainties; however, their couplings demonstrate a slight linear dependency on applied force.},

  abstract = {Dimerization and subsequent aggregation of polymers and biopolymers often occur under nonequilibrium conditions. When the initial state of the polymer is not collapsed, or the final folded native state, the dynamics of dimerization can follow a course sensitive to both the initial conditions and the conformational dynamics. Here, we study the dimerization process by using computer simulations and analytical theory, where the two monomeric polymer chains are in the elongated state and are initially placed at a separation distance, d 0 . Subsequent dynamics lead to the concurrent processes of collapse, dimerization, and/or escape. We employ Langevin dynamics simulations with a coarse-grained model of the polymer to capture certain aspects of the dimerization process. At separations d 0 much shorter than the length of the monomeric polymer, the dimerization could happen fast and irreversibly from the partly extended polymer state itself. At an initial separation larger than a critical distance, d c , the polymer collapse precedes dimerization , and a significant number of single polymers do not dimerize within the time scale of simulations. To quantify these competitions, we introduce several time-dependent order parameters, namely, (i) the time-dependent radius of gyration R G ( t ) of individual polymers describing the conformational state of the polymer, (ii) a center-to-center of mass distance parameter R MM , and (iii) a time dependent overlap function Q ( t ) between the two monomeric polymers, mimicking the contact order parameter popular in protein folding. In order to better quantify the findings, we perform a theoretical analysis to capture the stochastic processes of collapse and dimerization by using the dynamical disorder model.},

  abstract = {Buoyancy-driven convection currents arise from temperature gradients in thermal frontal polymerization (FP) when the spatially localized polymerization reaction travels perpendicularly to the gravity field. We propose a theoretical study of the system dynamics under adiabatic conditions. The polymer and the reactant mixture are considered to be in the same liquid phase, but the viscosity can increase with the degree of polymerization. We find that the reaction zone propagates as a hot spot-like pattern with a broken symmetry in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Furthermore, the system can reach an asymptotic dynamics characterized by a front with a steady shape that propagates at constant speed with a steady vortex surrounding it. As the strength of the vortex is increased, either by decreasing the reactants’ viscosity or by increasing the layer’s thickness, we observe a transition between (i) a passive regime predicted by pure reaction–diffusion and hydrodynamic models and (ii) an active chemo-hydrodynamic regime where such models separately break down. In the active regime (ii), the front speed decreases as convection intensifies. By means of a scaling analysis, we explain how hydrodynamic currents might lower the velocity of a polymerization wave. As the viscosity of the polymer is enlarged, the flow is shifted ahead of the reaction zone and becomes more symmetrical with respect to the middle of the system, as recently observed in solid–liquid FP experiments [Y.

This new structure has been derived using an ab initio density functional theory methodology and focusing on the agreement between the experimental and theoretical x-ray diffraction patterns. An extensive study has been performed to analyze the possible conformations that the polymeric strand can adopt in its crystalline form, leading to 60 initial crystalline structures. Due to thermal motion, which cannot be easily tackled with the ab initio methodology, and small inaccuracies, which are intrinsic to this calculation method, the theoretical unit cell dimensions can slightly differ from those obtained in the crystallization experiments. Thus, a structural refinement method has been employed to overcome these discrepancies and procure a crystalline structure whose x-ray diffraction pattern is consistent with the experimental one. For the proposed crystalline structure of PBF, both the powder diffraction pattern and the fiber diffraction diagram show a remarkable agreement with those available in the literature.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium phase coexistence is commonly observed in both biological and artificial systems, yet understanding it remains a significant challenge. Unlike equilibrium systems, where free energy provides a unifying framework, the absence of such a quantity in non-equilibrium settings complicates their theoretical understanding. Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by energy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate these systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting dense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually attributed to greater dissipation in denser regions. In this article, we demonstrate that this is not always the case. Using a simple numerical granular model, we show that a hot solid and a cold liquid can coexist in granular systems. This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision frequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent with equilibrium results for hard-disk systems. We further demonstrate that kinetic theory can be extended to accurately predict phase temperatures even at very high packing fractions, including within the solid phase. Our results highlight the importance of collisional dynamics and energy exchange in determining phase behavior in granular materials, offering new insights into non-equilibrium phase coexistence and the complex physics underlying granular systems.},

Distinct dry GB and TJ energies and GB widths are considered in contrast to the earlier phase-field studies, which assumed identical properties for the dry GBs and TJs and are far from reality. The strong effects of the intrinsic length scales, including the dry GB widths and grain size, on the temperatures of barrierless transformations between the solid, premelt (an intermediate stationary state between solid and melt with a degree of disorder) and melt, their nucleation induced by the GB network, kinetics, and complex microstructures evolution are explored, which was still missing in the literature. The thermodynamic processes involved in the melting of polycrystalline solids, which include the jump-like (discontinuous) appearance of premelt or melt pockets in the TJ regions, followed by premelting and melting of the connected GBs, curvature-driven shrinking of the grains surrounded by the melt pools and their jump-like melting at critical temperatures, all occurring at temperatures below the bulk melting point, are revealed. The reverse transformation (solidification) of the molten GB network and the bistability regime, where the temperatures for solid → premelt and premelt → solid transformations differ and yield thermal hysteresis, are studied. The role of the disjoining potential on the jump-like GB premelting and stability of the thermodynamic states is explored.},

However, the mismatch between anode and cathode dynamics is the biggest barrier to improving their performance. To address this issue, we propose a strategy for the preparation of porous MXene by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-controlled etching to solve the capacity degradation and ion diffusion limitation, which are caused by van der Waals forces between MXene nanosheets. This approach facilitates the realization of three-dimensional ion channels with both vertical and horizontal pathways, significantly enhancing the availability of active sites and improving the ion diffusion rate. By adjusting the amount of oxidant, porous MXene (P-MXene-2) with an optimal pore size range was obtained. The assembled half-cell has a capacity of 180 mAh g −1 at a rate of 0.05 A g −1 . Furthermore, by combining a porous carbon cathode with porous MXene and electrolyte screening, a SIHC with a high energy density of 110.6 Wh kg −1 at 1000 W kg −1 and 71.1 Wh kg −1 at 20 kW kg −1 was successfully constructed.

The key gas-sensing characteristics concerning chemiresistive (CR) and field-effect transistor (FET) gas sensing have been thoroughly explored. The results show that Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N can work as either CR or FET gas-sensing materials for detecting H 2 , O 2 , N 2 , CO, CO 2 , NH 3 , and H 2 O, whereas B-C 2 N can work as a disposable gas sensor for O 2 , H 2 O, and NH 3 . Mn@C 2 N and Ni@C 2 N are the most selective toward O 2 and NH 3 , followed by CO and H 2 O in an oxygen- and ammonia-free environment, while B-C 2 N is the most selective toward H 2 O and NH 3 . More importantly, the adsorption strength of target molecule plays a critical role in gas-sensing mechanism as well as selectivity, recovery time, and sensitivity. This study offers theoretical perspectives on 2D hybrid carbon-based nanomaterials for efficient gas sensing.},

Highly polarized spin probes were produced in situ by the addition of muonium to the aromatic anions, and the muon and methylene proton hyperfine coupling constants (hfccs) of these radical anions were determined from the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonance fields in the ALC- μ SR spectra. The motionally averaged dipolar muon hfccs, | D μ ‖ | ⁠ , were determined from the width and amplitude of the Δ 1 and Δ 0 resonances and used to estimate the extent of reorientational motion. The results are consistent with the counterions being electrostatically trapped near the oil/water interface of the surfactant bilayer and undergoing large amplitude anisotropic motion. This motion is generally more restricted in DODMAC bilayers compared with DHTAC, which is likely related to the relative flexibility of the headgroups to which the counterions are loosely bound. The motion of the ortho isomers is generally more restricted than the para isomers, while there is no obvious trend regarding the ethyl, chloro, and hydroxy substituents.},

  abstract = {Singlet fission, which may increase the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells, proceeds via multiple spin levels of a triplet pair. To clarify the spin-related elementary processes of the triplet pair, we measured the magnetoluminescence effect of the fluorescence of rubrene, in the form of orthorhombic polycrystalline powder, in the range of ±300 mT at room temperature. Model simulations using the density matrix method were performed to elucidate how the features of the magnetoluminescence effect depend on the triplet pair dynamics. Simulations of the observed field dependence of the magnetoluminescence effect revealed an anisotropy of 1:100 for the two-dimensional hopping of triplet excitons forming a triplet pair in the ab plane, for which the exchange interaction depends on the separation distance between the two triplet excitons. The effective lifetime of the spin-correlated triplet pair responsible for the magnetoluminescence effect is estimated to be 2.2 ns.},

The contributions of hot carriers, cooled carriers, and defect-trapped carriers to the transient absorption signals and the dynamic evolution of the carriers among themselves are elucidated. By comparing the carrier dynamics taking place at the boundary and internal regions, we find that the benign shallow defect state in the grain boundary region has a positive effect on accelerating the cooling of hot carriers, while the deep energy level defects induce excited state absorption signals.

  abstract = {Radical scavenging reaction rate constants were measured by monitoring the free induction decay (FID) of the unpaired electron of radicals by using laser-synchronized pulsed-EPR. This method probes large electron spin magnetization arisen from dynamic electron spin polarization (DEP), which remarkably enhances the EPR signal. DEP decays with the longitudinal spin relaxation time, which was observed by using the FID detection method. In the presence of a radical scavenger, the DEP decay time depends on both spin-lattice relaxation and the chemical reaction with the scavenger, the latter of which reduces radical concentration. The plots of DEP decay rates against the radical scavenger concentrations gave the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants for various radicals. This procedure was applied to determine the radical scavenging reaction rate constants of hydroxycyclohexyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, diphenylphosphinoyl, and α,α-dimethoxybenzyl radicals. The measured rate constants show good agreement with the previously reported values determined by using another method monitoring electron spin echo (ESE) decays of the radicals. We discussed the advantageous and disadvantageous characters of the FID detection method with respect to the existing ESE method in the viewpoints of signal intensity, selectivity of radicals, the simpleness of the measurements, and so on.},

  abstract = {In the present work, we investigate the thermal conductivity ( κ ) of different core–shell nanowires using molecular dynamics simulation and Green–Kubo (EMD), imposing a temperature gradient (NEMD) and Müller-Plathe (rNEMD) approaches. We show that in GaAs@InAs nanowires, the interface effect becomes more significant than the nanowire cross-sectional geometry. In particular, κ decreases as the interface area increases, reaching a minimum, and then increases when the interface strain relaxes. This is particularly important for thermoelectric applications, where minimization of κ is desired. In particular, the different methods can predict minima at different core diameters without special considerations. In addition, the NEMD approach and, to a lesser extent, rNEMD tend to overestimate the κ values, which cannot be corrected with the methods available in the literature. By analyzing the temperature and length dependence, (I) we show that interfacial scattering primarily involves phonon–phonon interactions, which mainly affect low-energy modes, a mechanism that effectively reduces κ at low temperatures. (II) The Langevin thermostat tends to pump low-energy modes in the NEMD approach, but this effect decreases with longer nanowires. (III) Energy exchanges in rNEMD stimulate high-energy phonons, derived from the saturation of κ at a much shorter nanowire length than NEMD. These findings highlight the challenges of accurately determining κ of ultrathin core–shell nanowires, where only the EMD approach provides precise results. With the recognition of non-equilibrium contributions to the overestimation of κ by NEMD and rNEMD, these methods can still provide valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying thermal transport mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We investigate fundamental aspects concerning selectivity in hydrogenation reactions for Solid Catalyst with Ionic Liquid Layer (SCILL)-type systems. Some of us recently reported that the adsorption behavior of 1,3-butadiene and 1-butene on Pt(111) can be tuned with ultrathin layers of the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 1 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]): Increasing the IL coverage leads to increased blocking of olefin adsorption sites. Notably, a smaller IL amount is needed to prevent 1-butene adsorption as compared to 1,3-butadiene adsorption, leading to a selectivity window, in which 1,3-butadiene still can be adsorbed while 1-butene cannot. With the aim to evaluate whether this is a general behavior, we study an IL with a longer alkyl chain at the cation, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N]), and an IL with a different anion, 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C 8 C 1 Im][PF 6 ]). Indeed, we observe a selectivity window for all ILs and thus demonstrate that this concept also applies for other ILs with different chain lengths and anions. Nevertheless, there are pronounced differences for the three ILs in terms of the IL coverages required for full blocking and the width of the selectivity window. Different explanations are discussed, e.g., the structure of the IL layer and the interaction strengths of olefins and ILs with the substrate.},

  abstract = {Aluminum (Al) is a potential anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and low volume expansibility. However, scalable fabrication of nanostructured Al still faces a great challenge. In addition, the lithium storage performance of Al anode materials always encounters a severe strike within a dozen discharge/charge cycles, and such an abnormal behavior of the Al anode material remains enigmatic. Herein, a mechanochemistry method without using any solvent is developed to achieve scalable production of Al nanoparticles and the morphology of the obtained Al nanoparticles could be regulated using Ketjen black (KB). KB with a chain-like structure could regulate the Al crystal growth process and the aggregation of Al nanoparticles during the solid-phase reaction, shortening the electron transfer path among Al crystals, ultimately activating the lithium storage behavior of nanostructured Al. Initial discharge/charge capacities of 630.6 and 402.0 mA h g −1 were achieved at 50 mA g −1 ; unfortunately, the nanostructured Al still suffered from rapid deterioration of lithium storage performance. Comprehensive analysis demonstrated that the raised energy barrier of LiAl formation and the slow lithium diffusion kinetics in the Al matrix may be the main factors destroying the lithium storage performance of the Al anode material. This work provided more evidence for illustrating the lithium storage behavior of the Al anode.},

  abstract = {Quantifying thermodynamics, structural, and dynamical properties of brine confined in clay pores is critical for a variety of geo-energy applications, including underground hydrogen storage (UHS) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are applied here to study aqueous NaCl brines within 10-Å kaolinite slit pores. NaCl concentrations are chosen at 5, 10, 12.5, and 15 wt. %, all below the solubility limit and high enough to provide statistically relevant information. The distribution of the ions within the nanopores is found not to be homogeneous. Explicitly, Na + cations, preferentially attracted to the siloxane surface, accumulate in regions with low water density, whereas Cl − anions, attracted to the gibbsite surface of kaolinite, are found within the hydration layers. Confinement affects the properties of ions, with ion pairing being more pronounced within the pore than in bulk aqueous solutions at similar temperatures, pressures, and compositions. Conversely, the ions affect the properties of confined water. For example, the lifetime of water–water hydrogen bonds in confinement is shortened within the hydration shells; increasing salinity from 5 to 12.5 wt. % reduces the likelihood of water density fluctuations near the kaolinite surfaces, although when the NaCl concentration rises from 12.5 to 15 wt. %, Cl − anions enhance the likelihood of density fluctuations for the hydration layer near the gibbsite surface. The simulated molecular trajectories are studied further to extract diffusion coefficients. While confinement in the kaolinite nanopore reduces the mobility of all species, non-monotonic trends are observed as a function of salt concentration. The trends seem associated with the likelihood of ion pairing. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficients for the cations are predicted to be higher than those for the anions, which is contrary to what is typically observed in bulk brines. Because density fluctuations are correlated with properties such as the solubility of gases in confined water, our observations may have important implications for geo-energy applications such as UHS and CCS.},

The traditional Boltzmann transport equation method is highly accurate but limited by the low-order phonon scattering model, which makes it difficult to resolve the high-order scattering effects of low symmetry layered materials. The classical molecular dynamics calculation is efficient but lacks accuracy due to the missing multi-component potential function. In this study, we develop a strategy to predict the thermal conductivity of K 0.8 Li 0.27 Ti 1.73 O 4 (KLTO), a model of layered oxides by machine-learning using a deep neural network model to acquire the interatomic potential of KLTO. The deep learning potential (DLP) is in excellent agreement with density functional theory in predicting atomic force, energy, and elastic properties. In addition, the calculated out-of-plane thermal conductivity values based on the DLP (0.37 W m −1 K −1 ) are close to experimental results (0.28 W m −1 K −1 ). This machine-learning framework for constructing interatomic potentials can be extended to other layered materials, offering a promising approach for advancing the theoretical study of such systems.},

  abstract = {Cyanogen chloride (CNCl) is a toxic chemical that poses significant risks to human health and the environment; therefore, its level must be accurately monitored. Herein, the adsorption of CNCl by transition metal-doped fluorinated diamanes (F-diamanes) has been extensively studied via first-principles calculations. Key parameters such as adsorption energies, charge transfer amounts, bandgaps, sensitivity, densities of states, projected density of states, charge density differences, and recovery time were systematically analyzed. Results reveal that monometallic doping significantly enhances CNCl adsorption, with increases in adsorption energy by 164%–368% and charge transfer by 1234%–1571%, particularly in the AuFD-CNCl, AgFD-CNCl, and CuFD-CNCl systems, which demonstrated improved sensing performances. Similarly, bimetallic co-doping further strengthened adsorption, with energy enhancements of 277%–309% and charge transfer increases of 1238%–1505%. Au-CuFD-CNCl, Au-AgFD-CNCl, and Cu-AgFD-CNCl systems also showed superior sensing performances. Meanwhile, the recovery time of CNCl molecules on the AuFD, AgFD, Au-CuFD, and Au-AgFD surfaces was drastically reduced to acceptable levels at 279–412 K, leading to their desorption. Therefore, these four systems exhibited excellent reversibility properties, suggesting their applicability in gas-sensing applications. This work can facilitate the applications of doped F-diamanes in environmental conservation, energy storage, and chemical engineering.},

  abstract = {In this study, a solution system of KCl–NH 4 Cl–NH 3 –H 2 O with different mass fractions was prepared at room temperature using x-ray scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations. From x-ray scattering, it was obtained that the peak near Q = 2.50 Å −1 in the F ( Q ) function changed from a flat-topped blunt peak to a bimodal peak as the concentration of ammonia increased. This change indicated that increased ammonia altered the hydrogen bonding network within the mixed solution. In the G ( r ) function, the peak near 3.25 Å enhances with the increase in ammonia concentration, suggesting a higher occurrence of N(NH 4 + )–N(NH 3 ) interactions. Raman spectroscopy findings demonstrated that in the KCl–NH 4 Cl aqueous mixture, the area of DDAA-type hydrogen bonds increased as KCl concentration decreased and NH 4 Cl concentration increased. This suggests that KCl disrupts DDAA-type hydrogen bonds more significantly than NH 4 Cl. The situation was reversed when ammonia was added to the system, implying that KCl damages the DDAA-type hydrogen bonding structure less than NH 4 Cl when NH 3 is present in the solution. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the coordination number of K–Cl increases with ammonia concentration, as ammonia’s lone pair of electrons can bind to NH 4 + to stabilize the [NH 4 (H 2 O) m−n (NH 3 ) n ] + complex. This study elucidates the underlying microscopic mechanisms behind the decrease in KCl solubility and the increase in NH 4 Cl solubility upon increased ammonia.},

  abstract = {Two main frameworks are commonly used to describe electrolyte solutions: the non-primitive model, which rigorously accounts for all interactions between ions and solvent molecules; and the primitive model, which treats the solvent as a dielectric continuum, only describing ion–ion interactions explicitly. The primitive model offers simple Helmholtz energy expressions, including the Debye–Hückel (DH) equation, the primitive mean spherical approximation (MSA), and the Born theory of solvation. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of primitive model approaches by comparing their Helmholtz energies with data from molecular simulations obtained for non-primitive model electrolyte solutions. We model electrolyte solutions as mixtures of equally sized, charged, and (non-polarizable) dipolar Lennard-Jones particles. Using thermodynamic integration, we isolate the Helmholtz energy contributions related to solvent–solvent, ion–solvent, and ion–ion interactions. Molecular simulations are performed across two temperatures and two densities, a range of charges, dipole moments, and ion mole fractions (0.005 ≤ x ions ≤ 0.05). Our results show that while the primitive model expressions provide a qualitatively reasonable description of electrolyte solutions, they systematically underestimate the Helmholtz energy contributions associated with ion–solvent and ion–ion interactions. Achieving quantitative agreement requires empirical adjustments to the Born radius. Notably, the optimized Born radii are significantly larger than the actual ion sizes used in the molecular simulations, questioning the primitive model’s applicability. This work presents rigorous benchmarks for the use of MSA, DH, and Born theories, along with molecular simulation data for non-primitive model electrolytes. These benchmarks provide insights for refining existing models and advancing the development of new equations of state for electrolyte solutions.},

However, the accurate determination of enthalpy, heat capacity, isothermal compressibility, isochoric pressure coefficient, and isobaric thermal expansion coefficient requires the addition of a quantum correction to the kinetic energy (QCKE). The QCKE is a post-simulation contribution to the thermodynamic properties of quantum fluids and, as such, can be used to improve the accuracy of any predictions using an intermolecular potential. The addition of QCKE to the SAAP + FH-1 potential results in values for the thermodynamic properties that are close to reference data for hydrogen at temperatures greater than 40 K and pressures up to 100 MPa.},

  abstract = {Rare earth aluminum garnets are important materials in optical, dielectric, and thermal barrier applications. To advance the understanding of their melt processing and glass forming ability, we report the atomic structure of molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 over 1770–2630 K, which spans the equilibrium and supercooled liquid regimes. The melt density at T m = 2283 K is 5.50 g cm −3 , measured via silhouette imaging of electrostatically levitated drops over 1010–2420 K. Four separate structure measurements were made with aerodynamically levitated melts using x-ray and neutron diffraction with isotope substitution of Yb ( 172 Yb, 174 Yb, or nat Yb). Empirical potential structure refinement models were developed, which are in excellent agreement with the experiments. Coordination environments for Al–O are predominantly 4- and 5-coordinate, with a mean coordination of n AlO = 4.43(8), while Yb–O environments mostly range from 5- to 8-coordinate, with n YbO = 6.26(8). The cation–oxygen polyhedra are connected primarily by corner-sharing, with edge-sharing constituting up to ∼1/3 of the connectivity among polyhedra with Yb or higher-coordinated Al–O. Structurally, the –Al–O– network in molten Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 appears conducive to glass formation: n OAl = 1.85(3), there are 1.86 AlO x –AlO x connections per Al atom (e.g., a mixture of Q 3 and Q 4 units), and the modal ring size is six cations. These characterize a network that is somewhat less constrained compared to SiO 2 glass, yet Yb 3 Al 5 O 12 cannot be quenched into crystal-free glass. Aluminum garnet compositions with larger rare earth cations do form glass, so these characterizations help reveal the structural characteristics corresponding to the limit of glass forming ability in rare earth aluminates.},

  abstract = {[ F e ( t e r p y ) 2 ] 2 + (terpy = 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine) is a transition metal complex where the spin state is photoswitchable and where the properties of the metal-centered quintet excited state ( 5 MC) can be tuned by substituting different electron withdrawing or electron donating groups on the 4′ position of the terpyridine. To better understand the physics determining the photoswitching performance, a deeper insight into the positions of the relevant potential energy surfaces and the molecular structure of the 5 MC state is needed. We present a structural investigation based on Time Resolved x-ray Solution Scattering (TR-XSS) by which we determine the average d Fe–N bond-length elongation following population of the 5 MC state as well as the lifetime of this state in a series of seven modified [ F e ( t e r p y ) 2 ] 2 + systems in aqueous solution following photo-excitation. The analysis of the TR-XSS data is supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics calculations. The quintet state lifetime is determined to vary by more than a factor of 10 (from 1.5 to 16 ns) based on the electron withdrawing/donating properties of the substituting group. Both the DFT calculations and the structural analysis of the experimental data show that the main photo-induced change in metal–ligand bond lengths Δ d Fe–N is ∼0.2 Å for all systems.},

However, the precise identification of preferred doping sites is challenging owing to its high structural complexity, which hinders establishing the structure–activity relationship. Here, through density functional theory calculations coupled with energy evaluation, delicate structural analysis, valence electron counting, and localized molecular orbital topology, we characterize the tetrahedral Au 3 Ag with closed-shell two valence electrons [Au 3 Ag(2 e )] as a fundamental building block in face-centered-cubic (FCC) ligand-protected AuAg (LP-AuAg) alloy nanoclusters. The kernel structures of FCC LP-AuAg alloy clusters are constructed by rational spatial packing of Au 3 Ag(2 e ), Au 4 (2 e ), and Au 3 (2 e ) blocks, aligning with the grand unified model of ligand-protected Au nanoclusters. In addition, we predict 40 FCC LP-AuAg alloy nanoclusters with 141 low-energy isomers. This work underscores the crucial role of subset blocks in stabilizing the entire cluster and provides valuable insights into the structural features of FCC LP-AuAg alloy clusters.},

A comprehensive study with two excitation wavelengths and a broadband white-light continuum probe (400–1400 nm) has determined that a torsional isomerization mechanism is the most probable for both isomers. This has shed light on the excited state behavior of the elusive push–pull Z isomer, which has its properties mostly predicted by simulations and systematically lacks experimental observations. Meanwhile, another unproductive relaxation pathway, associated with a symmetric bending motion, was found only for the E isomer. When relaxing through this pathway, the molecule encounters a potential barrier in the ground state, which requires significant structural reorganization before full relaxation. This local minimum can be more general than expected and may be behind unsolved issues in the literature of azobenzenes.},

  abstract = {An uncertainty-driven active learning strategy was employed to achieve efficient point sampling for full-dimension potential energy surface constructions. Model uncertainty is defined as the weighted square energy difference between two neural network models, and the local maximums of uncertainty would be added to the training set by two criteria. A two-step sampling procedure was introduced to reduce the computational costs of expansive double-precision neural network training. A reference potential energy surface (PES) of the 6-D H 2 O–He system was constructed first by the MLRNet model with a weighted Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.028 cm −1 . The full-dimension long-range function was fitted by a pruned basis expansion method. The current sampling method is reliable for the long-range switched fundamental invariant neural network (LS-FI-NN) to construct spectroscopically accurate PES, where the single precision model achieves a test set RMSE of 0.3253 cm −1 with 472 fitting points and the double precision model is 0.0710 cm −1 with only 613 points. In comparison, the MLRNet requires 652 points to reach a similar accuracy. However, the MLRNet, with fewer parameters, shows lower training errors across all sampling cycles and lower test errors in the first few cycles, indicating its potential with an appropriate sampling procedure. The spectroscopic calculations were performed to validate the accuracy of PESs. The energy levels of the double precision LS-FI-NN showed great agreement with the reference PES’s results, with only 0.0161 and 0.0044 cm −1 average errors for vibrational levels and the band origin shifts.},

The results show that the initial velocity of the droplets significantly influences the coalescence time and jumping characteristics. As the initial velocity increases, the coalescence time decreases, and the horizontal velocity increases, suggesting that controlling the initial velocity can adjust droplet motion behavior. In terms of energy conversion, the total energy conversion rate remains relatively constant at lower initial velocities but increases significantly as the velocity rises. This is primarily due to the reduced coalescence time and viscous dissipation caused by the increased initial kinetic energy, allowing more energy to be converted into the kinetic energy of jumping. The energy conversion rate in the horizontal direction increases with initial velocity, while in the vertical direction, it tends to decrease. This study deepens the understanding of coalescence-induced jumping phenomena at the nanoscale and provides a theoretical basis for engineering applications, showing that droplet behavior can be effectively modulated by controlling the initial velocity.},

Our theory successfully predicts the two reaction channels in iodomethane photodissociation that lead to I ( P 3 / 2 2 ) and I * ( P 1 / 2 2 ) products, showing excellent agreement with experimental delay-dependent kinetic energy release signals at large pump–probe delays. The theoretical kinetic energy release at small delays depends significantly on the choice of ionic states.

  abstract = {Multidimensional optical spectroscopy observes transient excitation dynamics through time evolution of spectral correlations. Its action-detected variants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected spectra is the presence of a stationary background of the so-called incoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a product of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state signal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected pump–probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent mixing arises from efficient exciton–exciton annihilation. In this work, we demonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal symmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent subtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive the expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the pulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we show both analytically and numerically, the difference signal constructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of incoherent mixing and highlights the excited-state dynamics. We further verify the approach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer and the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna light-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria. The approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump–probe spectroscopy without experimental modifications and is independent of the studied system, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular complexes.},

The priority focus in area-selective ALD is to achieve the desired selectivity; thus, most studies to date have been concentrated on the reaction mechanism of ALD on growth/nongrowth substrates or the development of novel methodologies to resolve the challenges associated with its implementation in high-volume manufacturing. In this study, we performed area-selective ALD of SiO 2 on SiO 2 , where SiO 2 was not grown on SiN x , and suggested area-selective ALD approaches that could simultaneously enhance selectivity and film quality. An NH 3 plasma treatment was applied to functionalize the SiN x surface with more Si–NH bonds, which exhibited low reactivity toward Si precursors. Although the SiO 2 surface was also functionalized with Si–NH bonds, it was not fully converted into Si–NH because of its thermodynamic nature at low temperatures. Consequently, the results showed that NH 3 plasma pretreatment was effective in increasing selectivity. Therefore, we performed a layer-by-layer NH 3 plasma treatment during the ALD of SiO 2 to deposit high-quality films without losing selectivity. The SiO 2 film was densified, as confirmed by x-ray reflection spectra without nitrogen impurity incorporation. Electrical property measurements of metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors confirmed that this approach enabled simultaneous selectivity and SiO 2 film-quality enhancement.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction almost three decades ago, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has evolved into a mature and powerful technique to reveal the inner workings of quantum systems with high temporal and spectral resolution. In general, this technique can isolate different contributions to the nonlinear response and provides access to different dynamical quantum pathways of the system evolution. Such isolation of pathways can be achieved in different experimental geometries. In its original, fully noncollinear implementation, directional phase matching allows for such signal isolation, while in the modern commonly employed pump–probe geometry, experimentally challenging phase-cycling schemes are employed. Here, we show how rephasing, non-rephasing, and zero- and double-quantum 2DES signals can be isolated in the pump–probe geometry without a need for phase-cycling. For this, we utilize established causality restrictions of the nonlinear response, allowing us to separate the different contributions in the spectral domain. We demonstrate this using data recorded for a molecular J-aggregate, acting as an effective three-level system. This approach bridges the gap between the capabilities of shaper-based and fully noncollinear 2DES and experimentally simpler implementations, such as those based on birefringent common-path interferometers.},

By integrating ultrafast techniques such as pump–probe and coherent multidimensional spectroscopy with microscopy techniques utilizing high numerical aperture objective lenses and structured beams, these approaches provide label-free chemical contrast and reveal transient phenomena critical to understanding complex systems. Recent advancements, including adaptive optics and tailored beam profiles, have further enhanced spatial and temporal control, unlocking new possibilities for studying heterogeneous systems. This work explores time-resolved nonlinear microspectroscopy using Laguerre–Gaussian beams with orbital angular momentum. Analytical expressions for pump–probe microspectroscopy signals are derived to elucidate how beam parameters influence nonlinear responses reflecting spatial diffusion and ultrafast relaxation processes. The results demonstrate the potential of customized ultrafast pulses and spatial light fields to improve both resolution and sensitivity, advancing dynamic studies in materials science, chemistry, and biology.},

  abstract = {It is now well established that the transition state of a chemical reaction is not a single, static structure but rather a distribution of configurations. However, the implications of this distributed nature remain incompletely characterized, particularly for quantum proton and hydride transfer reactions, where variations in donor–acceptor separations at the transition state are key: they can determine whether or not tunneling contributes to the transfer. Consequently, the transition state’s characterization critically depends on the chosen reaction coordinate, and several geometry-based and energy-based coordinates have been proposed for empirical valence bond and hybrid QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations of such reactions. Here, we systematically evaluate these coordinates, using a general analytic model for proton- and hydride-transfer reactions alongside important aspects of the enzymatic hydride transfer in formate dehydrogenase as a case study. Our analysis reveals significant limitations of common geometry-based and vertical energy gap coordinates, which often fail to isolate environmental effects and can bias the description of transition states. To address these issues, we propose an equilibrium energy difference coordinate that excludes the rapid fluctuations of the transferring quantum proton or hydride, focusing instead on the environment’s polarization. Additionally, we demonstrate that the broad distribution of transition state configurations implies that key reaction properties, such as rate constants and kinetic isotope effects, may not always report on the same subset of transition state configurations. This insight helps resolve some mechanistic ambiguities and highlights the importance of carefully selecting reaction coordinates for simulating reaction dynamics (especially for quantum particle transfers) in enzymatic and condensed-phase chemistry.},

Our method can access nucleation rates up to 50 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported results. We examine three cases: homogeneous pure system, system with static impurities, and system with mobile impurities, where impurities are defined as sites with zero interactions with neighboring spins (the spin value of impurities is set to 0). Classical nucleation theory holds across the entire temperature range studied in the paper, for both the homogeneous system and the static impurity case. However, in the case of mobile impurities, the umbrella sampling technique appears ineffective at low mobility values. These findings provide valuable insights into nucleation phenomena at low temperatures, contributing to theoretical and experimental understanding.},

We find that only one vibrational entropy approximation—the one proposed by Truhlar in 2011—which is used in only ∼2% of cases, is stable in the low-lying frequency region and does not exhibit this problem. Accordingly, this approximation shows the best accuracy and robustness on a diverse set of experimental complexation energies and can be somewhat improved even further.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In Paper I [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in Paper II [J. Jin, K. S. Schweizer, and G. A. Voth, J. Chem. Phys. 158 (3), 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks–Chandler–Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.},

It argues that, due to the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, the justification for using equilibrium thermostats for nonequilibrium simulations is inherited only by cases in which the perturbation is small enough for the perturbed system to behave like the unperturbed equilibrium system. In the process, this paper categorizes models of external perturbations in molecular dynamics as either responsive—i.e., perturbations that impose a force—or directive—i.e., perturbations that impose a trajectory. Since directive perturbations have not been studied enough in the literature but are becoming more relevant, their effects on simple perturbed thermostatted systems are considered. Finally, using a perturbed two-point harmonic oscillator as well as a driven particle immersed in a simple Lennard-Jones fluid, it gives an approximation for the limit of justified equilibrium thermostat use for perturbed systems. This paper hopes to inspire further research in the fields of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {Iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles have been extensively studied as T 2 contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. The theory of nuclear magnetic relaxation induced by superparamagnetic nanoparticles has been validated by numerous experimental studies in the case of spherical particles. Recently, several studies focused on the synthesis of cubic nanoparticles. Some of them reported significantly higher relaxivities compared to their spherical counterpart and attributed this increase to their specific shapes. This work investigates the impact of cube-shaped nanoparticles on nuclear magnetic relaxation through Monte Carlo methods. Transverse relaxation at high static magnetic field is simulated by modeling the proton diffusion in the magnetic field generated by a cubic or a spherical nanoparticle. The results indicate that, in the case of magnetite nanoparticles, there is no significant difference between both shapes for sizes above 30 nm when particles are compared at equal volumes and magnetization. Below this size, a −40%–15% variation of the relaxation rates is predicted for the cubic case compared to the spherical case. These results are explained using general relaxation models that incorporate the distribution of the magnetic field generated by the nanoparticles. The simulation predictions are compared to some experimental results from the literature, revealing that, in some cases, the magnetic field specific to the nanoparticle shape alone cannot explain the observed increase in the relaxation rate of cubic nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Gas diffusion in graphene nanochannels is pivotal for applications such as gas sensing and membrane separation, where nanoscale confinement introduces unique transport phenomena. Unlike bulk-phases, diffusion in graphene nanochannels is significantly influenced by adsorption, which modifies density distributions and alters diffusivity behavior. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are combined with a theoretical framework to comprehensively investigate gas diffusion under varying pressures and channel heights. A modified Chapman–Enskog model, derived from atomistic Lennard-Jones potential parameters, is proposed to account for the effects of confinement. Simulation results reveal that gas diffusivity decreases with increasing gas-phase pressure and decreasing channel height due to enhanced density in the nanochannels. Interestingly, for ultra-narrow channels ( h ≲ 0.7 nm), the diffusivity correction factor exhibits non-monotonic behavior, initially decreasing but subsequently increasing due to overlapping repulsive potential fields. The proposed model integrates adsorption effects through density predictions based on the Boltzmann distribution and effectively predicts gas diffusivities with relative errors of less than 13%, even under strong confinement. These findings highlight the critical interplay between adsorption and confinement in shaping gas transport within graphene nanochannels. The theoretical model provides a predictive tool for designing graphene-based gas separation and sensing devices, offering fundamental insights for optimizing their performance.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer processes are ubiquitous in nature and intensely investigated. The investigations concentrate on the transfer of small to intermediate sized energies. Here, we pose the question of whether the transfer of large energies, where relativistic effects play a central role, can be efficient. At large energies, the process leads to ionization of the environment, i.e., it is the interatomic (or intermolecular) Coulombic decay (ICD) process. To that end, we derive asymptotic expressions for the ICD amplitude by employing the Dirac–Breit Hamiltonian and expanding the frequency dependent Coulomb–Breit interaction between the electrons of the donor and those of the acceptor in powers of the inverse distance between their centers of mass. Expressions are separately derived for the two popular Feynman and Coulomb gauges. At long range, the two expressions have a different appearance but are proven to be equivalent. The derived energy transfer rate at long range shows that when the donor is embedded in an environment, the transfer can be highly efficient. A key is that the radiative lifetime of the donor is extremely short (it can be in the attosecond, 10 −18 s, regime), and the x-ray emission typically dominates by far Auger decay (also called Auger–Meitner decay), and the ICD can quench this emission. This contrasts with the situation at small to intermediate sized energies, where the radiative lifetime is much smaller and Auger decay (if the channel is open) dominates. In these cases, the major contribution to ICD comes from the neighbors nearby.},

  abstract = {Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations, provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size, making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs.

  abstract = {The original constrained dipole moment density functional theory allows one to control the magnitude of the molecular dipole moment in a variational and non-empirical way . In this work, we extend this methodology to control the three Cartesian components of the molecular dipole moment . The new theoretical development is suitable for the calculation of the charge-transfer energy contributions to the total interaction energies in non-covalent complexes. To test the reliability of the theoretical development, we form three sets of non-covalent complexes from the literature with a total of fifty-one systems. The former set of complexes includes many different types of non-covalent interactions, the second set consists of prototypical non-covalent complexes and three biologically relevant interactions between DNA base pairs, and the third set comprises halogen bonding complexes. We determined the charge-transfer energy contributions and the total interaction energies of all these complexes. The calculated charge-transfer energies are in very good agreement with the ones calculated using the fragment-based Hirshfeld methodology, which has been proven to be reliable. Nevertheless, the new procedure relies on the molecular dipole moment, which is observable, while the fragment-based Hirshfeld methodology relies on a definition of a population analysis.},

DM-EDA(EB) integrates density matrix-based EDA (DM-EDA) with the GFN n -xTB method to decompose the total interaction energy into electrostatic, exchange–repulsion, polarization, and correlation terms. Test cases demonstrate that DM-EDA(EB) can accurately analyze total interaction energies in large systems with the computational efficiency comparable to GFN n -xTB. Notably, by using the appropriate partition strategy, DM-EDA(EB) is able to provide quantificational knowledge of individual interactions in large assemblies.},

Although various MR diagnostics have been proposed, benchmarking studies that help identify the criteria for an effective diagnostic are still scarce. In this article, we examine a wide range of correlation measures to evaluate their potential as MR diagnostics. We identify a small set of valid size-intensive correlation measures based on maximum metrics, exhibiting similar predictive values. Among these, we highlight I ND max ⁠ , which offers an easy interpretation: it captures the largest deviation of a natural orbital occupancy from the boundary values corresponding to a single-reference wave function. No energy-based correlation measure was found suitable for constructing MR diagnostics. Finally, we demonstrate how average correlation measures, although not suitable as MR diagnostics, can provide a more comprehensive view of electron correlation within the molecule.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell–Schrödinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. In addition, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach—an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using simple dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.},

  abstract = {Introducing heavy atoms, or replacing atoms with heavier ones, is a routine approach for accelerating spin-flipping photophysical processes. However, predicting its impact on phosphorescence efficiency is not straightforward. Herein, we report an unexpected consequence of bromine-to-iodine substitution in a bromothienyl diketone derivative, TIPS-BrTn , that exhibits outstanding room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in cyclohexane solution. Contrary to our expectation, the iodo-congener TIPS-ITn exhibited feeble photoluminescence, which we confirmed as RTP by ultrafast spectroscopy. Further experimental and theoretical studies revealed that, in the T 1 state, an excited-state symmetry breaking occurred on TIPS-ITn while TIPS-BrTn preserved the centrosymmetric geometry. We identified the driving force for the symmetry breaking as an intramolecular two-center three-electron bonding interaction between iodine and carbonyl oxygen in the (n,π*) excited state. Consequently, while the direct T 1 –S 0 spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in TIPS-BrTn is symmetry-forbidden and zero, that of TIPS-ITn is non-zero due to the loss of centrosymmetry, thereby accelerating nonradiative T 1 –S 0 decay to diminish the RTP. Importantly, the phosphorescence rate constant is not solely dictated by the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC; instead, it can be rationalized by the intensity borrowing from higher singlet states. Thus, our work highlights the importance of controlling molecular symmetry, which could suppress the direct T 1 –S 0 SOC and lead to a preferential acceleration of radiative decay over nonradiative decay for achieving efficient RTP.},

In susceptibility representation, χ ″( ν ), the spectral shape of the structural relaxation is observed as an asymmetrically broadened peak with a ν 1 low- and ν − β high-frequency behavior. In this perspective article, we discuss common notions, recent results, and open questions regarding the spectral shape of the structural relaxation. In particular, we focus on the observation that a high-frequency behavior of ν −1/2 appears to be a generic feature in a broad range of supercooled liquids. Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. In addition, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules. Finally, we discuss the open questions regarding potential physical origins of the generic ν −1/2 behavior and the evolution of the spectral shape toward higher temperatures.},

This Perspective presents an overview of recently developed theoretical methods using artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing (QC) to simulate the dynamics of these systems. We briefly introduce the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization, which provides a single master equation suitable for representation by neural quantum states or quantum circuits. The promising performance of AI- and QC-based approaches is demonstrated through preliminary research on simulating the quantum dissipative dynamics of many-body OQSs. We also discuss the limitations and future developments of these methods, which hold promise for overcoming the computational challenges associated with many-body OQS dynamics.},
