Using this, we show that it sends $T(n)$-local Galois extensions to $T(n+1)$-local Galois extensions. Furthermore, we show that it sends cyclotomic extensions of height $n$ to cyclotomic extensions of height $n+1$, extending a result of Bhatt‚ÄìClausen‚ÄìMathew for $n=0$. As a consequence, we deduce that $K(n+1)$-localized $K$-theory satisfies hyperdescent along the cyclotomic tower of any $T(n)$-local ring. Counterexamples to such cyclotomic hyperdescent for $T(n+1)$-localized $K$-theory were constructed by Burklund, Hahn, Levy and the third author, thereby disproving the telescope conjecture.},

  abstract     = {In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $(t-1)$-colorable for every $t\ge 1$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason independently proved that every graph with no $K_t$ minor has average degree $O(t\sqrt {\log t})$ and hence is $O(t\sqrt {\log t})$-colorable. Recently, Norin, Song and the second author showed that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t(\log t)^{\beta })$-colorable for every $\beta &gt; 1/4$, making the first improvement on the order of magnitude of the $O(t\sqrt {\log t})$ bound. The first main result of this paper is that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t\log \log t)$-colorable. This is actually a corollary of our main technical result that the chromatic number of a $K_t$-minor-free graph is bounded by $O(t(1+f(G,t)))$ where $f(G,t)$ is the maximum of $\frac {\chi (H)}{a}$ over all $a\ge \frac {t}{\sqrt {\log t}}$ and $K_a$-minor-free subgraphs $H$ of $G$ that are small (i.e. $O(a\log ^4 a)$ vertices). This has a number of interesting corollaries. First as mentioned, using the current best-known bounds on coloring small $K_t$-minor-free graphs, we show that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t\log \log t)$-colorable. Second, it shows that proving Linear Hadwiger‚Äôs Conjecture (that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t)$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Third, we prove that $K_t$-minor-free graphs with clique number at most $\sqrt {\log t}/ (\log \log t)^2$ are $O(t)$-colorable. This implies our final corollary that Linear Hadwiger‚Äôs Conjecture holds for $K_r$-free graphs for every fixed $r$; more generally, we show there exists $C\ge 1$ such that for every $r\ge 1$, there exists $t_r$ such that for all $t\ge t_r$, every $K_r$-free $K_t$-minor-free graph is $Ct$-colorable. One key to proving the main theorem is building the minor in two new ways according to whether the chromatic number ‚Äòseparates‚Äô in the graph: sequentially if the graph is the chromatic-inseparable and recursively if the graph is chromatic-separable. The other key is a new standalone result that every $K_t$-minor-free graph of average degree $d=\Omega (t)$ has a subgraph on $O(t \log ^3 t)$ vertices with average degree $\Omega (d)$.},

It is usually divided into two parts, the first of which classifies functions which are not above the identity and the second of which classifies functions which are above the identity. Slaman and Steel proved the second part of the conjecture for Borel functions which are order-preserving (i.e. which preserve Turing reducibility). We prove the first part of the conjecture for all order-preserving functions. We do this by introducing a class of functions on the Turing degrees which we call ‚Äúmeasure-preserving‚Äù and proving that part 1 of Martin‚Äôs Conjecture holds for all measure-preserving functions and also that all nontrivial order-preserving functions are measure-preserving. Our result on measure-preserving functions has several other consequences for Martin‚Äôs Conjecture, including an equivalence between part 1 of the conjecture and a statement about the structure of the Rudin-Keisler order on ultrafilters on the Turing degrees.},

Pansu and Gromov [ Carnot-Carath√©odory spaces seen from within , Birkh√§user, Basel, 1996] observed that any surface embedded in $\mathbb {H}$ has Hausdorff dimension at least $3$, so there is no $\alpha$-H√∂lder embedding of a surface into $\mathbb {H}$ when $\alpha &gt;\frac {2}{3}$. Z√ºst [Anal. Geom. Metr.

In the present paper, we show that Z√ºst‚Äôs result is sharp by constructing $(\frac {2}{3}-\epsilon )$-H√∂lder maps from $D^2$ and $D^3$ to $\mathbb {H}$ that do not factor through a tree. We use these to show that if $0&lt;\alpha &lt; \frac {2}{3}$, then the set of $\alpha$-H√∂lder maps from a compact metric space to $\mathbb {H}$ is dense in the set of continuous maps and to construct proper degree-1 maps from $\mathbb {R}^3$ to $\mathbb {H}$ with H√∂lder exponents arbitrarily close to $\frac {2}{3}$.},

Widespread applications include image processing, domain adaptation and generative modelling, where it is common to optimise some parameters in order to minimise SW, which serves as a loss function between discrete probability measures (since measures admitting densities are numerically unattainable). All these optimisation problems bear the same sub-problem, which is minimising the SW energy. In this paper we study the properties of $\mathcal {E}: Y \longmapsto \mathrm {SW}_2^2(\gamma _Y, \gamma _Z)$, i.e. the SW distance between two uniform discrete measures with the same amount of points as a function of the support $Y \in \mathbb {R}^{n \times d}$ of one of the measures. We investigate the regularity and optimisation properties of this energy, as well as its Monte-Carlo approximation $\mathcal {E}_p$ (estimating the expectation in SW using only $p$ samples) and show convergence results on the critical points of $\mathcal {E}_p$ to those of $\mathcal {E}$, as well as an almost-sure uniform convergence and a uniform Central Limit result on the process $\mathcal {E}_p$. Finally, we show that in a certain sense, Stochastic Gradient Descent methods minimising $\mathcal {E}$ and $\mathcal {E}_p$ converge towards (Clarke) critical points of these energies.},

Precisely, we theoretically and numerically investigate the basic approximation properties of the M√ºntz Legendre polynomials for two sets of $\Lambda$ sequences: $\lambda _{k}=\lambda$, and $\lambda _k=k\lambda +q$ for some $\lambda$ and $q$. First, the projection and interpolation errors are analyzed and numerically tested for each of the two subclasses of polynomials, and some error estimates are derived for functions in non-uniformly weighted Sobolev spaces. Then, in order to demonstrate the applicability of the M√ºntz polynomials, a Galerkin spectral method based on the M√ºntz Legendre polynomials is proposed to solve the time-space fractional differential equation. The obtained numerical results show that the proposed method leads to an exponential convergence rate even if the exact solutions are not smooth. This is opposed to low order algebraic convergence if traditional orthogonal polynomials are used.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on multi-block optimization problems over transport polytopes, which underlie various applications including strongly correlated quantum physics and machine learning. Conventional block coordinate descent-type methods for the general multi-block problems store and operate on the matrix variables directly, resulting in formidable expenditure for large-scale settings. On the other hand, optimal transport problems, as a special case, have attracted extensive attention and numerical techniques that waive the use of the full matrices have recently emerged. However, it remains nontrivial to apply these techniques to the multi-block, possibly nonconvex problems with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we leverage the benefits of both sides and develop novel sampling-based block coordinate descent-type methods, which are equipped with either entropy regularization or Kullback-Leibler divergence. Each iteration of these methods solves subproblems restricted on the sampled degrees of freedom. Consequently, they involve only sparse matrices, which amounts to considerable complexity reductions. We explicitly characterize the sampling-induced errors and establish convergence and asymptotic properties for the methods equipped with the entropy regularization. Numerical experiments on typical strongly correlated electron systems corroborate their superior scalability over the methods utilizing full matrices. The advantage also enables the first visualization of approximate optimal transport maps between electron positions in three-dimensional contexts.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been widespread adoption of machine learning-based approaches to automate the solving of partial differential equations (PDEs). Among these approaches, Gaussian processes (GPs) and kernel methods have garnered considerable interest due to their flexibility, robust theoretical guarantees, and close ties to traditional methods. They can transform the solving of general nonlinear PDEs into solving quadratic optimization problems with nonlinear, PDE-induced constraints. However, the complexity bottleneck lies in computing with dense kernel matrices obtained from pointwise evaluations of the covariance kernel, and its partial derivatives , a result of the PDE constraint and for which fast algorithms are scarce. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a near-linear complexity algorithm for working with such kernel matrices. We present a sparse Cholesky factorization algorithm for these matrices based on the near-sparsity of the Cholesky factor under a novel ordering of pointwise and derivative measurements. The near-sparsity is rigorously justified by directly connecting the factor to GP regression and exponential decay of basis functions in numerical homogenization. We then employ the Vecchia approximation of GPs, which is optimal in the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to compute the approximate factor. This enables us to compute $\epsilon$-approximate inverse Cholesky factors of the kernel matrices with complexity $O(N\log ^d(N/\epsilon ))$ in space and $O(N\log ^{2d}(N/\epsilon ))$ in time. We integrate sparse Cholesky factorizations into optimization algorithms to obtain fast solvers of the nonlinear PDE. We numerically illustrate our algorithm‚Äôs near-linear space/time complexity for a broad class of nonlinear PDEs such as the nonlinear elliptic, Burgers, and Monge-Amp√®re equations. In summary, we provide a fast, scalable, and accurate method for solving general PDEs with GPs and kernel methods.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) is an emerging tool for reducing computational costs and provides memory savings when solving high-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose and analyze a semi-implicit dynamical low-rank discontinuous Galerkin (DLR-DG) method for the space homogeneous kinetic equation with a relaxation operator, modeling the emission and absorption of particles by a background medium. Both DLRA and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme can be formulated as Galerkin equations. To ensure their consistency, a weighted DLRA is introduced so that the resulting DLR-DG solution is a solution to the fully discrete DG scheme in a subspace of the standard DG solution space. Similar to the standard DG method, we show that the proposed DLR-DG method is well-posed. We also identify conditions such that the DLR-DG solution converges to the equilibrium. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Suppressing spurious oscillations is crucial for designing reliable high-order numerical schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws, yet it has been a challenge actively investigated over the past several decades. This paper proposes a novel, robust, and efficient oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) method on general meshes, motivated by the damping technique (see J. Lu, Y. Liu, and C. W. Shu [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 59 (2021), pp. 1299‚Äì1324]). The OEDG method incorporates an oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure after each Runge‚ÄìKutta stage, and it is devised by alternately evolving the conventional semidiscrete discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme and a damping equation. A novel damping operator is carefully designed to possess both scale-invariant and evolution-invariant properties. We rigorously prove the optimal error estimates of the fully discrete OEDG method for smooth solutions of linear scalar conservation laws. This might be the first generic fully discrete error estimate for nonlinear DG schemes with an automatic oscillation control mechanism. The OEDG method exhibits many notable advantages. It effectively eliminates spurious oscillations for challenging problems spanning various scales and wave speeds, without necessitating problem-specific parameters for all the tested cases. It also obviates the need for characteristic decomposition in hyperbolic systems. Furthermore, it retains the key properties of the conventional DG method, such as local conservation, optimal convergence rates, and superconvergence. Moreover, the OEDG method maintains stability under the normal Courant‚ÄìFriedrichs‚ÄìLewy (CFL) condition, even in the presence of strong shocks associated with highly stiff damping terms. The OE procedure is nonintrusive , facilitating seamless integration into existing DG codes as an independent module. Its implementation is straightforward and efficient, involving only simple multiplications of modal coefficients by scalars. The OEDG approach provides new insights into the damping mechanism for oscillation control. It reveals the role of the damping operator as a modal filter, establishing close relations between the damping technique and spectral viscosity techniques. Extensive numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and confirm the effectiveness and advantages of the OEDG method.},

  abstract     = {This paper analyses conforming and nonconforming virtual element formulations of arbitrary polynomial degrees on general polygonal meshes for the coupling of solid and fluid phases in deformable porous plates. The governing equations consist of one fourth-order equation for the transverse displacement of the middle surface coupled with a second-order equation for the pressure head relative to the solid with mixed boundary conditions. We propose novel enrichment operators that connect nonconforming virtual element spaces of general degree to continuous Sobolev spaces. These operators satisfy additional orthogonal and best-approximation properties (referred to as conforming companion operators in the context of finite element methods), which play an important role in the nonconforming methods. This paper proves a priori error estimates in the best-approximation form, and derives residual‚Äìbased reliable and efficient a posteriori error estimates in appropriate norms, and shows that these error bounds are robust with respect to the main model parameters. The computational examples illustrate the numerical behaviour of the suggested virtual element discretisations and confirm the theoretical findings on different polygonal meshes with mixed boundary conditions.},

Critical ingredient is the construction of low-dimensional local spaces and appropriate degrees of freedom that provide conformity in terms of a sufficiently large tensor space and that allow for any kind of physically relevant Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For Dirichlet boundary conditions and polygonal plates, we prove quasi-optimal convergence of the mixed scheme. An a posteriori error estimator is derived for the special case of the biharmonic problem. Numerical results for regular and singular examples illustrate our findings.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel technique for the approximation of strong solutions $u \in C(\overline {\Omega }) \cap W^{2,n}_\mathrm {loc}(\Omega )$ to uniformly elliptic linear PDE of second order in nondivergence form with continuous leading coefficient in nonsmooth domains by finite element methods (FEM). These solutions satisfy the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) maximum principle, which provides an a posteriori error control for $C^1$ conforming approximations. By minimizing this residual, we obtain an approximation to the solution $u$ in the $L^\infty$ norm. Although discontinuous functions do not satisfy the ABP maximum principle, this approach extends to nonconforming FEM as well thanks to well-established enrichment operators. Convergence of the proposed FEM is established for uniform mesh-refinements. The built-in a posteriori error control (even for inexact solve) can be utilized in adaptive computations for the approximation of singular solutions, which performs superiorly in the numerical benchmarks in comparison to the uniform mesh-refining algorithm.},
