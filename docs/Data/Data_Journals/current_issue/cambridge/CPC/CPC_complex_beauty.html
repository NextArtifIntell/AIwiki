  abstract     = {Let $T$ be a tree on $t$ vertices. We prove that for every positive integer $k$ and every graph $G$ , either $G$ contains $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint subgraphs each having a $T$ minor, or there exists a set $X$ of at most $t(k-1)$ vertices of $G$ such that $G-X$ has no $T$ minor. The bound on the size of $X$ is best possible and improves on an earlier $f(t)k$ bound proved by Fiorini, Joret, and Wood (2013) with some fast-growing function $f(t)$ . Moreover, our proof is short and simple.},

  abstract     = {A graph $G$ is $q$ - Ramsey for another graph $H$ if in any $q$ -edge-colouring of $G$ there is a monochromatic copy of $H$ , and the classic Ramsey problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in such a graph. This was broadened in the seminal work of Burr, Erdős, and Lovász to the investigation of other extremal parameters of Ramsey graphs, including the minimum degree. It is not hard to see that if $G$ is minimally $q$ -Ramsey for $H$ we must have $\delta (G) \ge q(\delta (H) - 1) + 1$ , and we say that a graph $H$ is $q$ - Ramsey simple if this bound can be attained. Grinshpun showed that this is typical of rather sparse graphs, proving that the random graph $G(n,p)$ is almost surely $2$ -Ramsey simple when $\frac{\log n}{n} \ll p \ll n^{-2/3}$ . In this paper, we explore this question further, asking for which pairs $p = p(n)$ and $q = q(n,p)$ we can expect $G(n,p)$ to be $q$ -Ramsey simple. We first extend Grinshpun’s result by showing that $G(n,p)$ is not just $2$ -Ramsey simple, but is in fact $q$ -Ramsey simple for any $q = q(n)$ , provided $p \ll n^{-1}$ or $\frac{\log n}{n} \ll p \ll n^{-2/3}$ . Next, when $p \gg \left ( \frac{\log n}{n} \right )^{1/2}$ , we find that $G(n,p)$ is not $q$ -Ramsey simple for any $q \ge 2$ . Finally, we uncover some interesting behaviour for intermediate edge probabilities. When $n^{-2/3} \ll p \ll n^{-1/2}$ , we find that there is some finite threshold $\tilde{q} = \tilde{q}(H)$ , depending on the structure of the instance $H \sim G(n,p)$ of the random graph, such that $H$ is $q$ -Ramsey simple if and only if $q \le \tilde{q}$ . Aside from a couple of logarithmic factors, this resolves the qualitative nature of the Ramsey simplicity of the random graph over the full spectrum of edge probabilities.},

  abstract     = {We study the mixing time of the single-site update Markov chain, known as the Glauber dynamics, for generating a random independent set of a tree. Our focus is obtaining optimal convergence results for arbitrary trees. We consider the more general problem of sampling from the Gibbs distribution in the hard-core model where independent sets are weighted by a parameter $\lambda \gt 0$ ; the special case $\lambda =1$ corresponds to the uniform distribution over all independent sets. Previous work of Martinelli, Sinclair and Weitz (2004) obtained optimal mixing time bounds for the complete $\Delta$ -regular tree for all $\lambda$ . However, Restrepo, Stefankovic, Vera, Vigoda, and Yang (2014) showed that for sufficiently large $\lambda$ there are bounded-degree trees where optimal mixing does not hold. Recent work of Eppstein and Frishberg (2022) proved a polynomial mixing time bound for the Glauber dynamics for arbitrary trees, and more generally for graphs of bounded tree-width. We establish an optimal bound on the relaxation time (i.e., inverse spectral gap) of $O(n)$ for the Glauber dynamics for unweighted independent sets on arbitrary trees. We stress that our results hold for arbitrary trees and there is no dependence on the maximum degree $\Delta$ . Interestingly, our results extend (far) beyond the uniqueness threshold which is on the order $\lambda =O(1/\Delta )$ . Our proof approach is inspired by recent work on spectral independence. In fact, we prove that spectral independence holds with a constant independent of the maximum degree for any tree, but this does not imply mixing for general trees as the optimal mixing results of Chen, Liu, and Vigoda (2021) only apply for bounded-degree graphs. We instead utilize the combinatorial nature of independent sets to directly prove approximate tensorization of variance via a non-trivial inductive proof.},

All tests are conducted concurrently. The goal is to minimise the total number of tests required. In this paper, we make the (realistic) assumption that tests are noisy, that is, that a group that contains an infected individual may return a negative test result or one that does not contain an infected individual may return a positive test result with a certain probability. The noise need not be symmetric. We develop an algorithm called SPARC that correctly identifies the set of infected individuals up to $o(k)$ errors with high probability with the asymptotically minimum number of tests. Additionally, we develop an algorithm called SPEX that exactly identifies the set of infected individuals w.h.p. with a number of tests that match the information-theoretic lower bound for the constant column design, a powerful and well-studied test design.},
