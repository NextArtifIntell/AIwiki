  abstract     = {In this paper, a modified structure of the classical Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN) named Double context layered with output self-weighted feedback loop Elman recurrent neural network (DCLOSWFLERNN) is proposed. It consists of two additional components (as compared to the ERNN model): one extra context layer and an adjustable weighted feedback loop in the output layer. This has resulted in the model&#39;s ability to approximate the underlying unknown mathematical relationship relating to the input-output data (obtained from any complex dynamical plant). The second emphasis of this paper pertains to the stability component, wherein the Lyapunov stability is utilized to develop a stable Back-propagation (BP) based weight update rule. Lastly, an adjustable learning rate is also suggested, which contributes to improving the learning algorithm&#39;s overall performance. The simulation results reveal that the proposed model has given better modeling accuracy as compared to the other considered neural models. This can be observed from the values obtained of the error-based indicators such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Average Error (MSE). The values of RMSE and MAE obtained from the proposed model during the modeling procedure are 0.0028 and 0.0035 which are the least among the obtained with other neural models.},

  abstract     = {In differential equation discovery algorithms, a priori expert knowledge is mainly used to constrain the form of the expected equation, making it impossible for the algorithm to truly discover equations. As a result, most differential equation discovery algorithms try to recover the coefficients for a known fixed form of the equation. In this paper, we, using the initial guess obtained automatically, modify the structure space instead of imposing rigid constraints so that specific terms appear more likely within the cross-over and mutation operators. In this way, we mimic expertly chosen terms while preserving the possibility of obtaining any form of differential equation. The paper shows that the extraction and use of knowledge allow it to outperform the SINDy algorithm in terms of search stability and robustness. Synthetic examples are given for Burgers, wave, and Kortewegâ€“de Vries equations.},

  abstract     = {Previous work on fine-grained sentiment analysis focuses on establishing the semantic correlations between words by means of attention mechanisms. More recently, effects of syntax-based models, applying graph convolution operation over dependency trees, are highlighted due to their superiority. However, these methods still have deficiencies. For one thing, little aspect-specific information is considered during semantic modeling of contextual words, which introduces irrelevant noise toward the aspect. For another, current syntax-based approaches either ignore the syntactic constituent knowledge, or fail to maintain the syntactic information from the reconstructed constituent tree. As such, no relation among words, phrases and clauses is built. In this work, a Semantic Enhanced Bi-Syntax Graph Convolutional Network (SEBS-GCN) is proposed to enhance semantics of context to the aspect, and capture the sentiment relevance among words, phrases and clauses. Specifically, we devise an aspect-aware gated mechanism to obtain the aspect-aware feature, based on the semantic correlations between the specific aspect and its contexts. Furthermore, the syntax information of the constituent tree is sufficiently exploited to analyze the hierarchical structure and the logical relation among words, phrases and clauses, based on which to capture the sentiment clues of the aspect.},

An adjustable funnel control is proposed by designing a new transformation variable, which ensures the consensus errors converge within the funnel.

A novel dual-channel event-triggered strategy is designed by employing the concept of two channels, to save the communication resources and controller resources at the same time. Meanwhile, the Zeno behavior is avoided as well. Two simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.},

  abstract     = {Precisely capturing spatial-temporal feature correlations represents an effective approach for improving the traffic flow prediction performance. However, accurate capturing of spatial-temporal features in traffic systems faces certain challenges, such as long-range correlations and node heterogeneity. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a novel traffic flow prediction model that incorporates spatial-temporal heterogeneous attention, allowing for dynamic perception of similar nodes. In the proposed model, a filter network dynamic parameter memory generator is used for real-time parameter adjustment, which assigns greater weights to nodes with higher similarity to mitigate spatial-temporal heterogeneity. In addition, a similarity-based node computation method, which uses the Wasserstein distance, is introduced to construct a spatial-temporal association matrix, allowing for the dynamic capturing of long-range correlations between nodes. The model&#39;s efficacy is validated through experiments on four publicly available traffic datasets. Results show that the proposed model consistently outperforms the best baselines in predictive accuracy. Furthermore, this study examines factors such as training data size, dimensionality, the number of attention heads, and the threshold of the spatial-temporal association matrix, and includes an ablation study to evaluate the model&#39;s overall performance.},

In addressing the finite-time safe optimal control issue, value functions incorporating designated barrier functions for the involved players are established within the transformed finite-time stable space. The finite-time safe optimal controller is derived from the solution to the transformed Nash equilibrium condition. An actor-critic structure is proposed for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the finite-time stable space, aimed at approximating the finite-time optimal value and its corresponded controller using a novel finite-time concurrent learning update law. A dynamic event-trigger rule adjusts the trigger condition in real time, thereby minimizing the computational and communicative demands associated with calculating Nash equilibrium. Lyapunov stability analysis is employed to examine the finite-time equilibrium of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hardware tests are carried out to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed finite-time safe control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal multi-objective optimization aims to balance the diversity and the convergence to obtain multiple complete and uniform Pareto optimal solution sets. In recent years, using machine learning models to improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms has become a hot topic. However, few studies utilize machine learning models to solve the imbalance problem between the diversity and the convergence in multimodal multi-objective optimization. Therefore, this paper proposes a multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm driven by variational graph autoencoder (VGAE), which can reproduce diversified offspring with good convergence by reconstructing the parent population. In reproduction, the parent population is constructed into graph data, and the VGAE is adopted to map the graph data to the latent space, obtaining the distribution information represented by the low-dimensional vector. By sampling the distribution, the VGAE can generate the offspring with the similar distribution to the parent, which can fill the less dense regions in the decision space and improve the exploitation ability. In archive updating, the convergence state based on the inverted generation distance between the non-dominated solutions and the worst dominated solutions is defined, and the state information of the convergence archive is transferred to the diversity archive to determine the dynamic niche. This niche comprehensively considers the distribution state and convergence degree of solutions in the diversity and convergence archives, which is employed to calculate the local convergence quality, retaining more promising solutions. The results of 48 benchmark problems and a practical application show that the proposed algorithm outperforms eight competitive algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In partial multi-label learning (PML), each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, which contains multiple relevant labels and noisy labels. The disambiguation-based strategy has been widely adopted by most existing PML methods, i.e., recovering the information of real labels from the set of candidate labels. To achieve this goal, these methods usually assume that global label correlations among different categories are applicable to all the instances, but local label correlations are seldom considered. In this paper, we propose a novel PML method to address this issue, termed Partial Multi-Label Learning with Label and Classifier Correlations (PML-LC), where both global and local label correlations are taken into consideration. Specifically, the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) technique is employed to obtain the global manifold structure information of the feature space, which is then transformed into the label space, acting as global label correlations. Moreover, a local label manifold regularizer is introduced to capture local label correlations. Besides, a covariance regularizer is also adopted to model classifier correlations when learning the mapping matrix. Experimental results on thirteen PML datasets demonstrate its superior performance over several state-of-the-art PML approaches.},
