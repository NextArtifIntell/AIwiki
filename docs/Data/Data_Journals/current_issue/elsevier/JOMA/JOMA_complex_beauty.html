  abstract     = {We show that the limiting variance of a sequence of estimators for a structured covariance matrix has a general form, that for linear covariance structures appears as the variance of a scaled projection of a random matrix that is of radial type, and a similar result is obtained for the corresponding sequence of estimators for the vector of variance components. These results are illustrated by the limiting behavior of estimators for a differentiable covariance structure in a variety of multivariate statistical models. We also derive a characterization for the influence function of corresponding functionals. Furthermore, we derive the limiting distribution and influence function of scale invariant mappings of such estimators and their corresponding functionals. As a consequence, the asymptotic relative efficiency of different estimators for the shape component of a structured covariance matrix can be compared by means of a single scalar and the gross error sensitivity of the corresponding influence functions can be compared by means of a single index. Similar results are obtained for estimators of the normalized vector of variance components. We apply our results to investigate how the efficiency, gross error sensitivity, and breakdown point of S-estimators for the normalized variance components are affected simultaneously by varying their cutoff value.},

Compared to the previous studies, a broader class of MSP estimators corresponding to different information-type measures is studied. The studied class of estimators includes also the estimator corresponding to the Kullback–Leibler information measure obtained with the logarithmic function. Consistency of the MSP estimators is proved when the assigned model class is correct, that is the true density belongs to the assigned class. The behaviour of the MSP estimator under different divergence measures is studied and the advantage of using MSP estimators corresponding to different information measures in the context of model validation is illustrated in simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Kundu (2017) proposed a multivariate skewed distribution, termed the Geometric-Normal (GN) distribution, by compounding the multivariate normal distribution with the geometric distribution. This distribution is a viable alternative to Azzalini’s multivariate skew-normal distribution and possesses several desirable properties. This paper introduces a novel class of asymmetric distributions by compounding the geometric distribution with scale mixtures of normal distributions. This class constitutes a special case of the continuous mixtures of multivariate normal distributions introduced by Arellano-Valle and Azzalini (2021). The proposed multivariate distributions exhibit high flexibility, featuring heavy tails, multi-modality, and the ability to model skewness. We have also derived several properties of this class and discussed specific examples to illustrate its applications. The expectation–maximization algorithm was employed to calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown parameters. Simulation experiments have been performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. For illustrative purposes, we have provided one multivariate data set where it has been observed that there exist members in the proposed class of models that can provide better fit compared to skew-normal, skew-t, and generalized hyperbolic distribution. In another example, it was demonstrated that when data generated from a heavy-tailed skew-t distribution is contaminated with noise, the proposed distributions offer a better fit compared to the skew-t distribution.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses large dimensional covariance matrix estimation with unknown mean. The empirical covariance estimator fails when dimension and number of samples are proportional and tend to infinity, settings known as Kolmogorov asymptotics. When the mean is known, Ledoit and Wolf (2004) proposed a linear shrinkage estimator and proved its convergence under those asymptotics. To the best of our knowledge, no formal proof has been proposed when the mean is unknown. To address this issue, we propose to extend the linear shrinkage and its convergence properties to translation-invariant estimators. We expose four estimators respecting those conditions, proving their properties. Finally, we show empirically that a new estimator we propose outperforms other standard estimators.},

  abstract     = {A new flexible tensor model for multiple-equation regressions that accounts for latent regime changes is proposed. The model allows for dynamic coefficients and multi-dimensional covariates that vary across equations. The coefficients are driven by a common hidden Markov process that addresses structural breaks to enhance the model flexibility and preserve parsimony. A new soft PARAFAC hierarchical prior is introduced to achieve dimensionality reduction while preserving the structural information of the covariate tensor. The proposed prior includes a new multi-way shrinking effect to address over-parametrization issues while preserving interpretability and model tractability. Theoretical results are derived to help with the choice of the hyperparameters. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on random scan Gibbs and back-fitting strategy is designed with priority placed on computational scalability of the posterior sampling. The validity of the MCMC algorithm is demonstrated theoretically, and its computational efficiency is studied using numerical experiments in different parameter settings. The effectiveness of the model framework is illustrated using two original real data analyses. The proposed model exhibits superior performance compared to the current benchmark, Lasso regression.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the estimation of multivariate extreme models with a discrete spectral measure using spherical clustering techniques. The primary contribution involves devising a method for selecting the order, that is, the number of clusters. The method consistently identifies the true order, i.e., the number of spectral atoms, and enjoys intuitive implementation in practice. Specifically, we introduce an extra penalty term to the well-known simplified average silhouette width, which penalizes small cluster sizes and small dissimilarities between cluster centers. Consequently, we provide a consistent method for determining the order of a max-linear factor model, where a typical information-based approach is not viable. Our second contribution is a large-deviation-type analysis for estimating the discrete spectral measure through clustering methods, which serves as an assessment of the convergence quality of clustering-based estimation for multivariate extremes. Additionally, as a third contribution, we discuss how estimating the discrete measure can lead to parameter estimations of heavy-tailed factor models. We also present simulations and real-data studies that demonstrate order selection and factor model estimation.},

If an order relation is present for the values of random vectors and a decision maker is interested in dominant/best points with respect to this order, centrality is not a useful concept. Therefore, cone expectile sets are introduced which depend on a vector preorder generated by a convex cone. This provides a way of describing and clustering a multivariate distribution/data cloud with respect to an order relation. Fundamental properties of cone expectiles are established including dual representations of both expectile regions and cone expectile sets. It is shown that set-valued sublinear risk measures can be constructed from cone expectile sets in the same way as in the univariate case. Inverse functions of cone expectiles are defined which should be considered as ranking functions related to the initial order relation rather than as depth functions. Finally, expectile orders for random vectors are introduced and characterized via expectile ranking functions.},

This testing procedure requires the maximum likelihood estimation of the two models under comparison, that is, the assumed HM model and the more general FM model, which is performed by suitable versions of the Expectation–Maximization algorithm.

In this context, the nonparametric estimation of a general drift function b ( t , x ) from a continuous observation of the N sample paths on [ 0 , T ] has never been investigated. Considering a set I ϵ = [ ϵ , T ] × A , with ϵ ≥ 0 and A ⊂ R , we build by a projection method an estimator of b on I ϵ . As the function is bivariate, this amounts to estimating a matrix of projection coefficients instead of a vector for univariate functions. We make use of Kronecker products, which simplifies the mathematical treatment of the problem. We study the risk of the estimator and distinguish the case where ϵ = 0 and the case ϵ &gt; 0 and A = [ a , b ] compact. In the latter case, we investigate rates of convergence and prove a lower bound showing that our estimator is minimax. We propose a data-driven choice of the projection space dimension leading to an adaptive estimator. Examples of models and numerical simulation results are proposed. The method is easy to implement and works well, although computationally slower than for the estimation of a univariate function.},
