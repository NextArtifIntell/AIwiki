  abstract     = {Cholera, an acute diarrheal disease, is a serious concern in developing and underdeveloped areas. A qualitative understanding of cholera epidemics aims to foresee transmission patterns based on reported data and mechanistic models. The mechanistic model is a crucial tool for capturing the dynamics of disease transmission and population spread. However, using real-time cholera cases is essential for forecasting the transmission trend. This prospective study seeks to furnish insights into transmission trends through qualitative dynamics followed by machine learning-based forecasting. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is employed to calibrate the proposed mechanistic model. We identify critical parameters that illustrate the disease’s dynamics using partial rank correlation coefficient-based sensitivity analysis. The basic reproduction number as a crucial threshold measures asymptotic dynamics. Furthermore, forward bifurcation directs the stability of the infection state, and Hopf bifurcation suggests that trends in transmission may become unpredictable as societal disinfection rates rise. Further, we develop epidemic-informed machine learning models by incorporating mechanistic cholera dynamics into autoregressive integrated moving averages and autoregressive neural networks. We forecast short-term future cholera cases in Malawi by implementing the proposed epidemic-informed machine learning models to support this. We assert that integrating temporal dynamics into the machine learning models can enhance the capabilities of cholera forecasting models. The execution of this mechanism can significantly influence future trends in cholera transmission. This evolving approach can also be beneficial for policymakers to interpret and respond to potential disease systems. Moreover, our methodology is replicable and adaptable, encouraging future research on disease dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In the course of epidemics, the pathogen may mutate to acquire a higher fitness. At the same time, such a mutant is automatically in an unfavorable position because the resident virus has a head start in accessing the pool of susceptible individuals. We considered a class of tunable small-world networks, where a parameter, p (the rewiring probability), characterizes the prevalence of non-local connections, and we asked, whether the underlying network can influence the fate of a mutant virus. Under an SIR model, we considered two measures of mutant success: the expected height of the peak of mutant infected individuals, and the total number of recovered from mutant individuals at the end of the epidemic. Using these measures, we have found the existence of an optimal (for an advantageous mutant virus) rewiring probability that promotes a larger infected maximum and a larger total recovered population corresponding to the advantageous pathogen strain. This optimal rewiring probability decreases as mean degree and the infectivity of the wild type are increased, and it increases with the mutant advantage. The non-monotonic behavior of the advantageous mutant as a function of rewiring probability may shed light into some of the complex patterns in the size of mutant peaks experienced by different countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract     = {Ecologists have shown considerable interest in the spatial patterns of organism distribution and the processes responsible for their formation and maintenance. The phytophagous insects typically use chemicals in plants as host-finding cues. Because nonvolatile chemicals remain near the source, the spatial structure of plant community determines the local distribution of insects. In addition, the plant chemical accumulation due to plant–plant interaction also influences the distribution of insects. In Rumex obtusifolius , for example, the production of phenolics is mediated by conspecific interaction. Rumex plants with high phenolic concentrations are preferred by the leaf beetle Gastrophysa atrocyanea , resulting in its spatial aggregation. Although this preference of beetles for nonvolatile chemicals should be beneficial in finding host plants, there is also a cost in terms of intraspecific competition among the beetles due to aggregation on certain chemical-rich hosts. To investigate the evolutionary significance of preference for nonvolatile chemicals and the ecological consequence of spatial distribution in leaf beetles, we constructed a mathematical model for the joint evolution of two preferences for plant size and chemical condition. In the model, beetles choose a resource based on the size and chemical concentrations of plants and are exposed to resource competition. Host plants accumulate the chemicals when they interact with neighboring conspecifics, and hence the level of chemical accumulation varies depending on the species composition and spatial distribution of the plant community. As a result, beetles became more sensitive to chemicals when the host species was rare and sparsely distributed in the community. The evolution of high chemical preference caused the aggregation of beetles and hence population size declined. We proposed a potential mechanism that underlies aggregated distribution in phytophagous insects, driven by the evolution of chemical preferences in response to plant community structure.},

  abstract     = {While a tree grows over many years, somatic mutations accumulate and form genetic variation among branches within an individual. Trees can transmit such mutations to subsequent generations, potentially enhancing the genetic diversity of the population. We study a mathematical model to understand the relationship between within-individual genetic variation and branching architecture. We generate branching architecture by repeatedly adding two new branches (main and lateral daughter branches) to each terminal branch (mother branch). The architecture is characterized by two key parameters: main-lateral ratio (ML) and daughter-mother ratio (DM). During branch elongation, somatic mutations accumulate in the stem cells of a shoot apical meristem (SAM) at the tip of each branch. In branching, all the stem cells are passed on from the mother to the main daughter branch, but only one stem cell is chosen for the lateral daughter branch. We evaluate genetic variation by Z ¯ , the mean genetic differences between all pairs of branches of a tree, and examine how Z ¯ varies with DM and ML while keeping the total branch length constant. As a result, (1) Z ¯ increases monotonically with ML; (2) Z ¯ attains the maximum for an intermediate DM, when stem cells in a SAM are genetically homogeneous; (3) Z ¯ decreases monotonically with DM when stem cells are heterogeneous. The effect of branching architecture varies significantly depending on the genetic heterogeneity within a SAM, which results from the behavior of stem cells during growth. Our study sheds light on the overlooked role of branching architecture in storing genetic diversity.},

  abstract     = {Food webs are a central subject in community ecology, because consumption supports the flow of matter through the system, which is at the base of many of its functions. Identifying the mechanisms that are at the origin of food web structure is useful, e.g., for restoration purposes. We investigated the extent to which trait-matching, which contributes to defining the strength of trophic interactions, can cause the emergence of food webs with a non-trivial, multi-trophic, hierarchical structure. We compared for that purpose the structural properties of food webs simulated by four food web model variants, depending whether trait-matching was linear or nonlinear and whether population dynamics and evolution were accounted for (dynamical model) or not (static model). Nonlinear trait-matching can restrict interactions in phenotypic space so as to obtain localized interactions (i.e., each species interact with a small subset of species), which is a key element for food web formation. In the static case, nonlinear trait-matching allowed for the emergence of food webs, at a relatively low connectance as with random graphs. In the dynamical case, nonlinear trait-matching combined with population dynamics and evolution allowed for the formation of groups of phenotypically close species, resulting in food webs with a multi-trophic, hierarchical structure.},

  abstract     = {Language contact refers to a situation in which speakers of different languages meet and interact. There are three consequences of language contact. The first one is language shift, where one language is replaced by another. The second one is language maintenance, where languages coexist without any language change. The question of how language shift takes place and under what conditions coexistence of languages is possible has drawn wide attention of linguists as well as of theoretical researchers in other disciplines. Most of the previous mathematical studies of language dynamics have shown that there is majority advantage in the competition and that the population eventually becomes dominated by a single language that was spoken by a majority when the competition started. However, it is known that the contact of different languages could lead to the third consequence: the emergence of a new language, such as creole languages. Our study aims to model the spread of creole languages by using evolutionary game theory and determine the factors that drive the spread of creoles in the population. We consider an evolutionary game with individuals who speak either one of two ancestral languages or the creole that resulted from language contact between those two ancestral languages. Due to the formation process of creole, the creole speakers can communicate with speakers of other languages to some, but not full, extent. We assume that their frequencies change according to their payoffs that reflect how well they can communicate with others. Under this basic assumption, we varied (i) the population size and (ii) the difficulty of language change, to see their effects on the spread of the creole. Results show that the creole is more likely to spread if the population size is small enough for random drift to work well and/or if two ancestral languages are linguistically distant. We also find that finiteness of the population can either favor or disfavor the spread of creole depending on detailed conditions. Our results suggest that the contact between two distant languages and random drift drive the spread of creoles. It is known that many creole languages appeared in plantations where European owners brought labor forces from Africa as slaves. Our results match the homestead phase of these plantations, where European languages are distant from African ones, and where the population size was small.},

  abstract     = {Humans often cooperate in groups with friends and family members with varying degrees of genetic relatedness. Past kin selection can also be relevant to interactions between strangers, explaining how the cooperation first arose in the ancestral population. However, modelling the effects of relatedness is difficult when the benefits of cooperation scale nonlinearly with the number of cooperators (e.g., economies of scale). Here, we present a direct fitness method for rigorously accounting for kin selection in n -player interactions with m discrete strategies, where a genetically homophilic group-formation model is used to calculate the necessary higher-order relatedness coefficients. Our approach allows us to properly account for non-additive fitness effects between relatives (synergy). Analytical expressions for dynamics are obtained, and they can be solved numerically for modestly sized groups and numbers of strategies. We illustrate with an example where group members can verbally agree (cheap talk) to contribute to a public good with a sigmoidal benefit function, and we find that such coordinated cooperation is favoured by kin selection. As interactions switched from family to strangers, in order for coordinated cooperation to persist and for the population to resist invasion by liars, either some level of homophily must be maintained or following through on the agreement must be in the self-interests of contributors. Our approach is useful for scenarios where fitness effects are non-additive and the strategies are best modelled in a discrete way, such as behaviours that require a cognitive ‘leap’ of insight into the situation (e.g., shared intentionality, punishment).},
