  abstract     = {The Method of Equal Shares (ES) is a popular approval-based multi-winner voting rule, which was originally proposed by Peters and Skowron. It satisfies several well-known representation axioms, like extended justified representation (EJR) and priceability, and it can be computed in polynomial time. Further, it has already been employed in several real participatory budgeting elections. In this note, we prove that ES is an instance of the EJR-Exact family of voting rules that also satisfy EJR and were proposed by Aziz et al. 2018 before the work of Peters and Skowron.},

The author&#39;s recent preprint [1] has introduced a TFNP problem related to the pigeonhole principle over a quotient set, called Quotient Pigeon , and shown that the problem Quotient Pigeon is not only PPP -hard but also PLS -hard. In this paper, we formulate other computational problems related to the pigeonhole principle over a quotient set via an explicit representation of the equivalence classes. Our new formulation introduces a non-trivial PPP ∩ PPA k -complete problem for every k ≥ 2 . Furthermore, we consider the computational complexity of a computational problem related to Kőnig&#39;s lemma, which is a weaker variant of the problem formulated by Pasarkar et al. [2] . We show that our weaker variant is PPAD -hard and is in PPP ∩ PPA .},

A configuration is a bijection from V ( X ) to V ( Y ) , representing an arrangement of n people at n locations. The friends-and-stranger problem investigates the connectivity of two arbitrary configurations by a sequence of swaps of two people that are neighbors (i.e., adjacent in X ) and friends (i.e., adjacent in Y ).

  abstract     = {Maximum agreement forests have been used as a measure of dissimilarity of two or more phylogenetic trees on a given set of taxa. An agreement forest is a set of trees that can be obtained from each of the input trees by deleting edges and suppressing degree-2 vertices. A maximum agreement forest is such a forest with the minimum number of components. We present a simple 4-approximation algorithm for computing a maximum agreement forest of multiple unrooted binary trees. This algorithm applies LP rounding to an extension of a recent ILP formulation of the maximum agreement forest problem on two trees by Van Wersch et al. [13] . We achieve the same approximation ratio as the algorithm by Chen et al. [3] , but our algorithm is extremely simple. We also prove that no algorithm based on the ILP formulation by Van Wersch et al. can achieve an approximation ratio of 4 − ε , for any ε &gt; 0 , even on two trees. To this end, we prove that the integrality gap of the ILP approaches 4 as the size of the two input trees grows.},

  abstract     = {Decision Diagrams (DDs) are among the most popular representations for Boolean functions. They are widely used in the synthesis and verification of digital circuits. The size (i.e., number of nodes) and computation time (required time for performing operations) are two important parameters that determine the efficiency of a DD in different applications. It has been proven that some DDs can represent specific functions in polynomial space or perform certain operations in polynomial time. For example, Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are capable of representing a wide variety of functions (e.g. integer addition) in polynomial space with respect to the input size. However, there are also some functions (e.g., integer multiplication) for which the exponential lower-bounds have been proven for the BDD sizes. In this paper, we investigate the space complexity of representing an integer addition, where one of the operands is shifted to the right by an arbitrary value. We call this function the shifted addition. This function is widely used in many digital circuits, e.g., floating point adders. We prove that the size of the BDD representing a shifted addition has exponential space complexity with respect to the input size. It is an important step towards clarifying the reasons behind the failure of BDD-based verification and synthesis when they are applied to the circuits containing shifted addition, e.g., floating point adders.},

  abstract     = {The Online Delay Management on a Single Train Line (ODMP) deals with the question at which station a train should wait for delayed passengers, instead of forcing them to take the next train. Waiting at a station increases the delay of all passengers that are already on board, and the goal is to minimize the total passenger delay. An online algorithm learns about the number of delayed passengers at a station only when reaching this station. We study the ODMP with an additional prediction on the future input data, which an online algorithm can utilize. Two desired qualities for online algorithms with prediction are called consistency and robustness, denoting the competitive ratio in case of best and worst prediction respectively. We present a family of algorithms, which uses a hyperparameter λ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) measuring the “doubt” about the given prediction. This allows to achieve ( 1 + λ ) -consistency and ( 1 + 1 / λ ) -robustness. Moreover, we provide a lower bound for the trade-off between consistency and robustness for two variously detailed prediction models, showing that our algorithm achieves an asymptotically optimal trade-off for small values of λ .},
