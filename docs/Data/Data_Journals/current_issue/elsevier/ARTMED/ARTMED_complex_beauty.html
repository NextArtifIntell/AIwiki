  abstract     = {Objective Malaria remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, responsible for approximately 5,97,000 deaths according to World Malaria Report 2024. The study aims to systematically review current methodologies for automated analysis of the Plasmodium genus in malaria diagnostics. Specifically, it focuses on computer-assisted methods, examining databases, blood smear types, staining techniques, and diagnostic models used for malaria characterization while identifying the limitations and contributions of recent studies. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Peer-reviewed and published studies from 2020 to 2024 were retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus. Inclusion criteria focused on studies utilizing deep learning and machine learning models for automated malaria detection from microscopic blood smears. The review considered various blood smear types, staining techniques, and diagnostic models, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the automated diagnostic landscape for malaria. Results The NIH database is the standardized and most widely tested database for malaria diagnostics. Giemsa stained-thin blood smear is the most efficient diagnostic method for the detection and observation of the plasmodium lifecycle. This study has been able to identify three categories of ML models most suitable for digital diagnostic of malaria, i.e., Most Accurate- ResNet and VGG with peak accuracy of 99.12 %, Most Popular- custom CNN-based models used by 58 % of studies, and least complex- CADx model. A few pre and post-processing techniques like Gaussian filter and auto encoder for noise reduction have also been discussed for improved accuracy of models. Conclusion Automated methods for malaria diagnostics show considerable promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing human error. While deep learning models have demonstrated high performance, challenges remain in data standardization and real-world application. Addressing these gaps could lead to more reliable and scalable diagnostic tools, aiding global malaria control efforts.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has been successfully applied to histopathology image classification tasks. However, the performance of deep models is data-driven, and the acquisition and annotation of pathological image samples are difficult, which limit the model&#39;s performance. Compared to whole slide images (WSI) of patients, histopathology image datasets of animal models are easier to acquire and annotate. Therefore, this paper proposes an unsupervised domain adaptation method based on semantic correlation clustering for histopathology image classification. The aim is to utilize Minmice model histopathology image dataset to achieve the classification and recognition of human WSIs. Firstly, the multi-scale fused features extracted from the source and target domains are normalized and mapped. In the new feature space, the cosine distance between class centers is used to measure the semantic correlation between categories. Then, the domain centers, class centers, and sample distributions are self-constrainedly aligned. Multi-granular information is applied to achieve cross-domain semantic correlation knowledge transfer between classes. Finally, the probabilistic heatmap is used to visualize the model&#39;s prediction results and annotate the cancerous regions in WSIs. Experimental results show that the proposed method has high classification accuracy for WSI, and the annotated result is close to manual annotation, indicating its potential for clinical applications.},

Therefore, the possibility of diagnosing Parkinson’s disease at an earlier stage, and possibly prognosticate it, could be an advantage. Given this, a literature review that covers current studies in the field is relevant. Methods: The aim of this study is to present a systematic literature review in which the models used for the diagnosis and prognosis of Parkinson’s disease through voice and speech assessment are elucidated. Three databases were consulted to obtain the studies between 2019 and 2023: SienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and ACM Library . Results: One hundred and six studies were considered eligible, considering the definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The vast majority of these studies (94.34%) focus on diagnosing the disease, while the remainder (11.32%) focus on prognosis. Conclusion: Voice analysis for the diagnosis and prognosis of Parkinson’s disease using machine learning techniques can be achieved, with very satisfactory performance results, like is demonstrated in this systematic literature review.},

  abstract     = {Effective representation of medical concepts is crucial for secondary analyses of electronic health records. Neural language models have shown promise in automatically deriving medical concept representations from clinical data. However, the comparative performance of different language models for creating these empirical representations, and the extent to which they encode medical semantics, has not been extensively studied. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of three popular language models - word2vec, fastText, and GloVe - in creating medical concept embeddings that capture their semantic meaning. By using a large dataset of digital health records, we created patient trajectories and used them to train the language models. We then assessed the ability of the learned embeddings to encode semantics through an explicit comparison with biomedical terminologies, and implicitly by predicting patient outcomes and trajectories with different levels of available information. Our qualitative analysis shows that empirical clusters of embeddings learned by fastText exhibit the highest similarity with theoretical clustering patterns obtained from biomedical terminologies, with a similarity score between empirical and theoretical clusters of 0.88, 0.80, and 0.92 for diagnosis, procedure, and medication codes, respectively. Conversely, for outcome prediction, word2vec and GloVe tend to outperform fastText, with the former achieving AUROC as high as 0.78, 0.62, and 0.85 for length-of-stay, readmission, and mortality prediction, respectively. In predicting medical codes in patient trajectories, GloVe achieves the highest performance for diagnosis and medication codes (AUPRC of 0.45 and of 0.81, respectively) at the highest level of the semantic hierarchy, while fastText outperforms the other models for procedure codes (AUPRC of 0.66). Our study demonstrates that subword information is crucial for learning medical concept representations, but global embedding vectors are better suited for more high-level downstream tasks, such as trajectory prediction. Thus, these models can be harnessed to learn representations that convey clinical meaning, and our insights highlight the potential of using machine learning techniques to semantically encode medical data.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the response of a cancer cell line to a therapeutic drug is pivotal for personalized medicine. Despite numerous deep learning methods that have been developed for drug response prediction, integrating diverse information about biological entities and predicting the directional response remain major challenges. Here, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model, DRExplainer, which leverages a directed graph convolutional network to enhance the prediction in a directed bipartite network framework. DRExplainer constructs a directed bipartite network integrating multi-omics profiles of cell lines, the chemical structure of drugs and known drug response to achieve directed prediction. Then, DRExplainer identifies the most relevant subgraph to each prediction in this directed bipartite network by learning a mask, facilitating critical medical decision-making. Additionally, we introduce a quantifiable method for model interpretability that leverages a ground truth benchmark dataset curated from biological features. In computational experiments, DRExplainer outperforms state-of-the-art predictive methods and another graph-based explanation method under the same experimental setting. Finally, the case studies further validate the interpretability and the effectiveness of DRExplainer in predictive novel drug response.

  abstract     = {Diagnosis prediction predicts which diseases a patient is most likely to suffer from in the future based on their historical electronic health records. The time series model can better capture the temporal progression relationship of patient diseases, but ignores the semantic correlation between all diseases; in fact, multiple diseases that are often diagnosed at the same time reflect hidden patterns that are conducive to diagnosis, so predefined global disease co-occurrence graph can help the model understand disease relationships. But it may contain a lot of noise and ignore the semantic adaptation of the disease under the diagnosis target. To this end, we propose a graph-driven end-to-end framework, named A daptive D isease R epresentation L earning (ADRL), obtain disease representation after learning complex disease relationships, and then use it to improve diagnosis prediction performance. This model introduces an adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust and optimize disease relationships by performing self-supervised perturbations on a predefined global disease co-occurrence graph, thereby learning a global disease relationship graph that contains complex semantic association information between diseases. The computational burden of adaptive global disease graph can be further alleviated by the proposed SVD-based accelerator. Finally, experimental results on two real-world EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms existing models in diagnosis prediction.},

  abstract     = {Mitosis detection is one of the fundamental tasks in computational pathology, which is extremely challenging due to the heterogeneity of mitotic cell. Most of the current studies solve the heterogeneity in the technical aspect by increasing the model complexity. However, lacking consideration of the biological knowledge and the complex model design may lead to the overfitting problem while limited the generalizability of the detection model. In this paper, we systematically study the morphological appearances in different mitotic phases as well as the ambiguous non-mitotic cells and identify that balancing the data and feature diversity can achieve better generalizability. Based on this observation, we propose a novel generalizable framework (MitDet) for mitosis detection. The data diversity is considered by the proposed diversity-guided sample balancing (DGSB). And the feature diversity is preserved by inter- and intra- class feature diversity-preserved module (InCDP). Stain enhancement (SE) module is introduced to enhance the domain-relevant diversity of both data and features simultaneously. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms all the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in several popular mitosis detection datasets in both internal and unseen test sets using point annotations only. Comprehensive ablation studies have also proven the effectiveness of the rethinking of data and feature diversity balancing. By analyzing the results quantitatively and qualitatively, we believe that our proposed model not only achieves SOTA performance but also might inspire the future studies in new perspectives.

  abstract     = {Even though mental health is a human right, mental disorders still affect millions of people worldwide. Untreated and undertreated mental health conditions may lead to suicide, which generates more than 700,000 deaths annually around the world. The broad adoption of smartphones and wearable devices allowed the recording and analysis of human behaviors in digital devices, which might reveal mental health symptoms. This analysis constitutes digital phenotyping research, referring to frequent and constant measurement of human phenotypes in situ based on data from smartphones and other personal digital devices. Therefore, this article presents a systematic literature review providing a computer science view on data analytics for digital phenotyping in mental health. This study reviewed 5,422 articles from ten academic databases published up to September 2024, generating a final list of 74 studies. The investigated databases are ACM, IEEE Xplore, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, Pubmed, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, Web of Science, and Wiley. We investigated ten research questions, considering explored data, employed devices, and techniques for data analysis. This review also organizes the application domains and mental health conditions, data analytics techniques, and current research challenges. This study found a growing research interest in digital phenotyping for mental health in recent years. Current approaches still present a high dependence on self-reported measures of mental health status, but there is evidence of the employment of smartphones for leveraging passive data collection. Traditional machine learning techniques are the main explored strategies for analyzing the large amount of collected data. In this regard, published approaches deeply focused on data analysis, generating opportunities concerning the implementation of resources for assisting individuals suffering from mental disorders.},

  abstract     = {Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) aims to noninvasively estimate heart surface potentials starting from body surface potentials. This is classically based on geometric information on the torso and the heart from imaging, which complicates clinical application. In this study, we aim to develop a deep learning framework to estimate heart surface potentials solely from body surface potentials, enabling wider clinical use. The framework introduces two main components: the transformation of 3D torso and heart geometries into standard 2D representations, and the development of a customized deep learning network model. The 2D torso and heart representations maintain a consistent layout across different subjects, making the proposed framework applicable to different torso-heart geometries. With spatial information incorporated in the 2D representations, the torso-heart physiological relationship can be learnt by the network. The deep learning model is based on a Pix2Pix network, adapted to work with 2.5D data in our task, i.e., 2D body surface potential maps (BSPMs) and 2D heart surface potential maps (HSPMs) with time sequential information. We propose a new loss function tailored to this specific task, which uses a cosine similarity and different weights for different inputs. BSPMs and HSPMs from 11 healthy subjects (8 females and 3 males) and 29 idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) patients (11 females and 18 males) were used in this study. Performance was assessed on a test set by measuring the similarity and error between the output of the proposed model and the solution provided by mainstream ECGI, by comparing HSPMs, the concatenated electrograms (EGMs), and the estimated activation time (AT) and recovery time (RT). The mean of the mean absolute error (MAE) for the HSPMs was 0.012 ± 0.011, and the mean of the corresponding structural similarity index measure (SSIM) was 0.984 ± 0.026. The mean of the MAE for the EGMs was 0.004 ± 0.004, and the mean of the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was 0.643 ± 0.352. Results suggest that the model is able to precisely capture the structural and temporal characteristics of the HSPMs. The mean of the absolute time differences between estimated and reference activation times was 6.048 ± 5.188 ms, and the mean of the absolute differences for recovery times was 18.768 ± 17.299 ms. Overall, results show similar performance between the proposed model and standard ECGI, exhibiting low error and consistent clinical patterns, without the need for CT/MRI. The model shows to be effective across diverse torso-heart geometries, and it successfully integrates temporal information in the input. This in turn suggests the possible use of this model in cost effective clinical scenarios like patient screening or post-operative follow-up.},
