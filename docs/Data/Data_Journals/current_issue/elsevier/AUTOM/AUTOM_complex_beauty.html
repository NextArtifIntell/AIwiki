  abstract     = {The optimal configuration of multi-agent systems (MASs) has long been a challenging task to fulfill abundant three-dimensional (3D) non-convex coverage operations. This brief proposes a spheroidal coverage control scheme, where a spheroidal partition protocol is designed with a distributed estimator to ensure an equitable workload in each sub-region. Afterwards, a distributed control law is developed to asymptotically deploy each agent to the associated optimal configuration. Significantly, the analytical challenge of the present design lies in the convergence analysis of the three-level cascading systems induced by the proposed spheroidal partition protocol. Finally, numerical simulation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the present spheroidal coverage control method.},

Unlike most existing works, where knowledge of the system dynamics of the leader node is required for follower agents in advance, this paper presents a distributed observer-based finite-time formation tracking control framework that operates independently of the system dynamic knowledge of the leader node. Firstly, two novel classes of finite-time adaptive distributed observers are constructed to estimate both the state and unknown dynamics of the leader system. The associated adaptation parameters can converge to the true values in finite time under an initial excitation condition, rather than the existing restrictive persistently exciting or cooperative finite-time excitation condition. Then, a finite-time formation tracking controller is developed based on the presented finite-time observers; with the help of Lyapunov stability theory, the finite-time formation tracking criterion for the considered system with an uncertain leader is derived from the constructed controller. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented finite-time formation tracking controller.},

Unlike previous works on the cooperation of interconnected two-time-scale systems, we consider nonidentical dynamics for each agent that may be characterized by different dimensions and time-scaling factors. Additionally, the systems are interconnected through a switching graph with a disconnected topology, rendering more challenging the analysis and the controller design. To address these challenges, a hybrid two-layer hierarchical control protocol is proposed. The upper layer utilizes an impulsive cooperative control strategy to generate local references, enabling discrete-time interactions among agents and thereby reducing the communication burden. The lower layer implements an internal model-based controller for the two-time-scale dynamics to track the generated references, demonstrating robustness against small model uncertainties. Closed-loop analysis is based on input-to-state stability (ISS) results for hybrid systems. Furthermore, the obtained result is extended to achieve the output consensus. Finally, two examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.},

After treating the time delay as a transport PDE, the overall plant configuration becomes ODE-PDE-PDE. Combining the PDE and ODE backstepping designs, a three-step backstepping transformation is proposed to build the continuous-in-time control law. A PDE observer is designed to track the PDE states required in the control law using a boundary measurement. Then, a dynamic event-triggering mechanism is designed, based on the evaluation of the overall ODE-PDE-PDE system, to determine the updating times of the control signal. In the resulting output-feedback event-based closed-loop system, a strictly positive lower bound of the minimal dwell time is found, which is independent of initial conditions. As a result, the absence of a Zeno behavior is guaranteed. Besides, exponential convergence to zero of all signals is proved via Lyapunov analysis, including the H 1 norm of the transport PDE state, the L 2 norm of the reaction–diffusion PDE and observer states, the actuator states, the internal dynamic variable in the event-triggering mechanism, as well as the control input. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulation.},

Given a target goal region, our first approach consists of a control scheme that avoids unsafe regions of the state space and observes the disturbance behavior until the goal is reachable with high probability. We leverage collected observations and the mixed monotonicity property of dynamical systems to efficiently obtain high-probability overapproximations of the system’s reachable sets. These overapproximations improve as more observations are collected. For our second approach, we consider the problem of minimizing cost while navigating toward the goal region and modify our previous formulation to allow for the estimated confidence bounds on the disturbance to be adjusted based on what would reduce the overall cost. We explicitly consider the additional cost incurred through exploration and develop a formulation wherein the amount of exploration performed can be directly tuned. We show theoretical results confirming that this confidence bound modification strategy outperforms the previously developed strategy on a simplified system. We demonstrate the first approach on an example of a motorboat navigating a river, then showcase a Monte Carlo simulation comparison of both approaches on a planar multirotor navigating toward a goal region through an unknown wind field.},

Such an untrusted controller may be provided by a malicious third party, who claims to deliver optimal control performance but actually attempts to exploit the system. Alternatively, untrusted controllers arising from benign factors such as inaccurate modeling or human error may also destabilize the system and cause security breaches. The system operator, with limited access to the knowledge of the system, may not be able to verify the untrusted controllers offline. To mitigate this risk, we propose a “plug-and-play” modification to the untrusted controller with minimal requirement on system knowledge, which switches to a known stabilizing controller when the norm of the difference between the untrusted and fallback control inputs exceeds a certain threshold. We show that for linear stochastic systems, this safeguard mechanism is both resilient and efficient, in the sense that: 1) the linear–quadratic cost of the system is always bounded even if the original untrusted controller is destabilizing; 2) in case the untrusted controller is stabilizing, the performance loss caused by the safeguard converges super-exponentially to 0 for Gaussian noise, while converging polynomially for general heavy-tailed noise. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safeguard strategy via numerical simulation on the Tennessee Eastman Process.},

  abstract     = {The evader’s dominance region is an important concept and the foundation of geometric methods for pursuit-evasion games. This article mainly reveals the relevant properties of the evader’s dominance region, especially in non-anticipative information patterns. We can use these properties to research pursuit-evasion games in non-anticipative information patterns. The core problem is under what condition the pursuer has a non-anticipative strategy to prevent the evader leaving its initial dominance region before being captured regardless of the evader’s strategy. We first define the evader’s dominance region by the shortest path distance, and we rigorously prove for the first time that the initial dominance region of the evader is the reachable region of the evader in the open-loop sense. Subsequently, we prove that there exists a non-anticipative strategy by which the pursuer can capture the evader before the evader leaves its initial dominance region’s closure in the absence of obstacles. For cases with obstacles, we provide a counter example to illustrate that such a non-anticipative strategy does not always exist, and provide a necessary condition for the existence of such strategy. Finally, we consider a scenario with a single corner obstacle and provide a sufficient condition for the existence of such a non-anticipative strategy. At the end of this article, we discuss the application of the evader’s dominance region in target defense games.

The transmitted data may be modified by an adversary. The previous literature mainly investigates potential impacts of several feasible stealthy integrity attacks on remote estimator in the multi-sensor setup instead of the worst-case estimation performance. It should be pointed out that the analysis of the worst-case performance of remote estimator under the attacks can provide a reference for operators to identify the vulnerability of systems and decide whether corresponding defensive measures need to be executed. Hence, such analyses play an importance role in ensuring system security. In this work, a cyber-attack pattern utilizing true and contaminated information from all sensors is developed.

To tackle this issue, we propose a method of network combination, wherein some high-dimensional delayed CBMAS (DeCBMAS) is regarded as a combination of sub-DeCBMASs that are of dimension lower than 2, according to a certain combination mode. By defining all combination modes as the intersection between semilocking sets and intersecting species sets, we further classify the complex and diverse boundaries brought about by high dimensions and resolve them by utilizing the boundaries of subsystems accordingly, which could not be resolved in previous work. This approach overcomes the bottleneck of persistence in high-dimensional DeCBMAS in some degree. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is also demonstrated through several examples, highlighting its practical applicability.},

Owing to the effect of bandwidth restriction, the communication information between two adjacent agents is based on the binary-valued observation of the imprecise sender’s output, which is only 1-bit. Each agent employs the recursive projection algorithm to estimate the states of all neighbors. Then, an event-triggered coordination technique is proposed to address the consensus problem. The first characteristic of this technique is that the information data transmission between two adjacent agents is managed by an event-triggered scheduler. The second characteristic of this technique is that each agent adopts the event-triggered control protocol to achieve the ultimate target. By this technique, the estimation error and the consensus error can converge to zero in the mean square sense and in the almost sure sense with explicit convergence speeds. Moreover, the communication rate of the communication scheme between two adjacent agents does not exceed fifty percent. And the communication rate of the control scheme can almost surely converge to zero with an explicit rate. Compared with the existing results, these two communication rates can be extremely reduced when achieving the same convergence value. As a result, the communication resources can be saved in terms of quantization, communication and control. An example is presented to illustrate the advantage of the proposed technique.},

In light of a nonlinear internal model approach, we first convert the robust PORP into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. By employing an extremum-seeking control (ESC) approach, the construction of our solution method avoids the use of Nussbaum-type gain techniques to address the robust PORP subject to unknown control directions with time-varying coefficients. The stability of the non-adaptive output regulation design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. As a result, the practical output regulation problem can be solved using the proposed non-adaptive and non-Nussbaum-type framework. Moreover, both the estimation and tracking errors uniformly asymptotically converge to zero, provided that the frequency of the dither signal goes to infinity. Finally, a simulation example with unknown coefficients is provided to exemplify the validity of the proposed control solution frameworks.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of irreversible thermodynamic systems have been expressed in terms of conservative contact systems where contact vector fields are generated by contact Hamiltonian functions defined on the Thermodynamic Phase Space (TPS). In this paper, we first emphasize the importance of both the Gibbs relation and the Gibbs–Duhem relation of the entropy or energy contact form in developing a first-order invariance constraint that every contact Hamiltonian function must satisfy. This novel insight is then considered together with the zero-order invariance constraint to infer solutions, thereby yielding a generalized family of contact Hamiltonian functions generating non-strict or strict contact vector fields which are equal on the associated Legendre submanifold on which the dynamics of the thermodynamic system is living. Finally, we show sufficient conditions under which the inverse images of zero by the contact Hamiltonian functions or the Legendre submanifold are globally attractive when lifting the system dynamics to the complete TPS. A simulated example is given to support the theoretical developments and to discuss the difference of the dynamic behaviours between the generated strict and non-strict contact vector fields.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the verification of current-state opacity and opaque time in timed discrete event systems modeled with labeled time Petri nets (LTPNs). First, we formally conceptualize current-state opacity and opaque time for LTPN systems. Based on the solution of a set of linear programming problems (LPPs) associated with the transitions-related timing constraints in the modified state class graph (MSCG) of an LTPN system, an approach is proposed to find all the state classes and logic transition sequences that the system may generate at a given time instant. By utilizing such state classes and logic transition sequences, a method for verifying the current-state opacity of an LTPN system is presented, avoiding an exhaustive enumeration of the state classes that are consistent with all the observable label sequences at the time instant. To further acquire the current-state opaque time of the LTPN system, we propose a method for calculating the length of opaque time based on the solution of LPPs that are associated with the paths in the MSCG. Particularly, an algorithm is reported to compute the opaque time of an LTPN system with respect to a given secret. Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate the proposed algorithms to determine the current-state opacity and opaque time for an LTPN system.},

This paper focuses on maximizing the smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix via adding edges for both undirected and directed networks. For undirected networks, under intuitive conditions, we prove that adding one edge between two vertices that correspond to the smallest and largest eigenvector components for the smallest eigenvalue will maximize the smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix. In addition, the discussion is extended to the case of multiple edge addition, where a suboptimal algorithm is proposed to maximize the eigenvalue with a low time complexity. For directed networks, when fixing a vertex i and adding an edge pointing to it, choosing the vertex, if there is any, that has the smallest eigenvector component than that of i leads to the maximal increase of the smallest eigenvalue. We apply the derived results to the distributed neighbor selection for directed networks.},

  abstract     = {Validating and controlling safety-critical systems in uncertain environments necessitates probabilistic reachable sets of future state evolutions. The existing methods of computing probabilistic reachable sets normally assume that stochastic uncertainties are independent of system states, inputs, and other environment variables. However, this assumption falls short in many real-world applications, where the probability distribution governing uncertainties depends on these variables, referred to as contextual uncertainties . This paper addresses the challenge of computing probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic nonlinear states with contextual uncertainties by seeking minimum-volume polynomial sublevel sets with contextual chance constraints. The formulated problem cannot be solved by the existing sample-based approximation method since the existing methods do not consider conditional probability densities. To address this, we propose a consistent sample approximation of the original problem by leveraging conditional density estimation and resampling. The obtained approximate problem is a tractable optimization problem. Additionally, we prove the proposed sample-based approximation’s almost uniform convergence, showing that it gives the optimal solution almost consistently with the original ones. Through a numerical example, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing approaches, highlighting its capability to significantly reduce the bias inherent in sample-based approximation without considering a conditional probability density.},

  abstract     = {In structured system theory, a pattern matrix is a matrix with entries either fixed to zero or free to take arbitrary numbers. The (generic) rank of a pattern matrix is the rank of almost all its realizations. The resilience of various system properties is closely tied to the rank resilience of the corresponding pattern matrices. Yet, existing literature predominantly explores the latter aspect by focusing on perturbations that change the zero–nonzero structure of pattern matrices, corresponding to link additions/deletions. In this paper, we consider the rank resilience of pattern matrices against structured perturbations that can arbitrarily alter the values of a prescribed set of entries, corresponding to link weight variations. We say a pattern matrix is structurally rank r resilient against a perturbation pattern if almost all realizations of this pattern matrix have a rank not less than r under arbitrary complex-valued realizations of the perturbation pattern. We establish a generic property in this concept. We then present combinatorial necessary and sufficient conditions for a rectangular pattern matrix to lose full rank under given perturbation patterns. We also generalize them to obtain a sufficient condition and a necessary one for losing an arbitrarily prescribed rank. We finally show our results can be applied to the resilience analysis of various properties of structured (descriptor) systems, including controllability and input-state observability, as well as characterizing zero structurally fixed modes.},

Firstly, a point prediction neural network model is constructed with input and output data, the prediction error is assumed to be unknown but bounded. Then, a feasible set related to the output weights of the neural network model is described by ellipsoid bundles, which allows decreasing conservatism compared to other types of sets such as zonotopes or ellipsoids. To obtain a more precise description shape of the feasible set, an optimal iterative formula is theoretically derived by minimizing the Frobenius norm of ellipsoid bundles. Next, an outer bounding box is established to obtain the maximum and minimum weights that satisfy the feasible set, thereby providing the output prediction interval. This interval characterizes the systems’ disturbance and can be used as the threshold when dealing with fault diagnosis applications. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed interval neural network model is demonstrated by using faulty data from a wastewater treatment process. Simulation results verify that the proposed method can achieve accurate prediction outputs and fault diagnosis performance.},

The verification of SOC and the corresponding sensor and actuator placement problems, i.e., the problems of determining the minimum number of outputs and inputs required to achieve SFO and SOC, respectively, are yet open for general systems. This motivates our focus on a large class of systems enabling polynomial-time solutions. In this line, we first define and characterize generically diagonalizable systems, referring to structured systems for which almost all realizations of the state matrices are diagonalizable. We then develop computationally efficient criteria for SFO and SOC within the context of generically diagonalizable systems. Our work expands the class of systems amenable to polynomial-time SOC verification. Thanks to the simplicity of the obtained criteria, we derive closed-form solutions for determining the minimal sensor placement to achieve SFO and the minimal actuator deployment to achieve SOC in such systems, along with efficient weighted maximum matching-based and weighted maximum flow-based algorithms. For more general systems to achieve SFO, we establish an upper bound on the number of required sensors by identifying a non-decreasing property of SFO with respect to a specific class of edge additions, which is proven to be optimal under certain conditions.},

  abstract     = {In optimal control problem, policy iteration (PI) is a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) tool used for designing optimal controller for the linear systems. However, the need for an initial stabilizing control policy significantly limits its applicability. To address this constraint, this paper proposes a novel scaling technique, which progressively brings a sequence of stable scaled systems closer to the original system, enabling the acquisition of stable control gain. Based on the designed scaling update law, we develop model-based and model-free scaling policy iteration (SPI) algorithms for solving the optimal control problem for discrete-time linear systems, in both known and completely unknown system dynamics scenarios. Unlike existing works on PI based RL, the SPI algorithms do not necessitate an initial stabilizing gain to initialize the algorithms, they can achieve the optimal control under any initial control gain. Finally, the numerical results validate the theoretical findings and confirm the effectiveness of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Linear immersions (such as Koopman eigenfunctions) of a nonlinear system have wide applications in prediction and control. In this work, we study the properties of linear immersions for nonlinear systems with multiple omega-limit sets. While previous research has indicated the possibility of discontinuous one-to-one linear immersions for such systems, it has been unclear whether continuous one-to-one linear immersions are attainable. Under mild conditions, we prove that any continuous immersion to a class of systems including finite-dimensional linear systems collapses all the omega-limit sets, and thus cannot be one-to-one. Furthermore, we show that this property is also shared by approximate linear immersions learned from data as sample size increases and sampling interval decreases. Multiple examples are studied to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {We study an agent’s lifecycle portfolio choice problem with stochastic labor income, borrowing constraints and a finite retirement date. Similarly to Biffis et al. (2020), wages evolve in a path-dependent way, but the presence of a finite retirement time leads to a novel, two-stage infinite dimensional stochastic optimal control problem with explicit optimal controls in feedback form. We find an explicit solution to the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation, which is an infinite dimensional PDE of parabolic type. The identification of the optimal feedbacks is delicate due to the presence of time-dependent state constraints, which appear to be new in the infinite dimensional stochastic control literature. The explicit solution allows us to study the properties of optimal strategies and discuss their implications for portfolio choice. As opposed to models with Markovian dynamics, path dependency can now modulate the hedging demand arising from the implicit holding of risky assets in human capital, leading to richer asset allocation predictions consistent with wage rigidity and the agents learning about their earning potential.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new decentralized approach for producing emergent curve trajectories in swarms of agents. The central innovation lies in use of a quaternion-based stabilizing embedding, which permits the application of linear control policies to produce globally-stable behaviour from local observations. Agents are modelled as particles in free space using double integrator dynamics. We stabilize an arbitrary number of agents indirectly, through virtual representations bijected onto a circle, and then produce elaborate curve trajectories through a family of topological homeomorphisms. We formulate these virtual agents as embeddings, through a combination of state feedback, rotations, and variable changes. The result is evenly-spaced swarms along the desired trajectories, with each agent only requiring information about the state of its neighbours. Simulations demonstrate the emergent qualities of the swarm as it converges to the desired geometry. The agents maintain separation and automatically compensate for loss or addition of agents in the swarm. We provide mathematical proofs of stability for the embedding, trajectories, and controller.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a computationally efficient, robust density control strategy for the mean-field model of a robotic swarm. We formulate a static optimal control problem (OCP) that computes a robot velocity field which drives the swarm to a target equilibrium density, and we prove the stability of the controlled system in the presence of transient perturbations and uncertainties in the initial conditions. The density dynamics are described by a linear elliptic advection–diffusion equation in which the control enters bilinearly into the advection term. The well-posedness of the state problem is ensured by an integral constraint. We prove the existence of optimal controls by embedding the state constraint into the weak formulation of the state dynamics. The resulting control field is space-dependent and does not require any communication between robots or costly density estimation algorithms. Based on the properties of the primal and dual systems, we first propose a method to accommodate the state constraint. Exploiting the properties of the state dynamics and associated controls, we then construct a modified dynamic OCP to speed up the convergence to the target equilibrium density of the associated static problem. We show that the finite-element discretization of the static and dynamic OCPs inherits the structure and several useful properties of their infinite-dimensional formulations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our control approach through numerical simulations of scenarios with obstacles and an external velocity field.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed parameter estimation in sensor networks. Each sensor makes successive observations of an unknown d -dimensional parameter, which might be subject to Gaussian random noises. The sensors aim to infer the true value of the unknown parameter by cooperating with each other. To this end, we first generalize the so-called dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) algorithm to stochastic systems, with which the problem of estimating a d -dimensional vector parameter is transformed to that of d scalar ones: one for each of the unknown parameters. For each of the scalar problem, both combine-then-adapt (CTA) and adapt-then-combine (ATC) diffusion-based estimation algorithms are given, where each sensor performs a combination step to fuse the local estimates in its in-neighborhood, alongside an adaptation step to process its streaming observations. Under weak conditions on network topology and excitation of regressors, we show that the proposed estimators guarantee that each sensor infers the true parameter, even if any individual of them cannot by itself. Specifically, it is required that the union of topologies over an interval with fixed length is strongly connected. Moreover, the sensors must collectively satisfy a cooperative persistent excitation (PE) condition, which relaxes the traditional PE condition. Numerical examples are finally provided to illustrate the established results.},

  abstract     = {Voltage instability is a complex dynamic phenomenon in today’s electric power systems. The onset of voltage instability is usually related to the loss of proper solutions to the nonlinear power flow equations, which express the fundamental law governing electric power and voltages in a power grid. Thus, studying the solvability of the power flow equations is at the heart of the voltage stability problem. In this paper, we transform the solvability problem of the power flow equations to a stability problem of a discrete dynamical system defined by a holomorphic mapping in several complex variables. Then, we show a general result on the fixed points of holomorphic functions invariant in a polydisc. Using these analytical tools, we obtain a strong explicit condition that certifies the existence and uniqueness of a proper solution to the nonlinear power flow equations. The new condition reveals in a precise way the interplay between voltage instability, the electrical and topological structures of the power grid, and the electric load characteristics. The new condition is proven to be stronger than existing ones. Extensive computational experiments further demonstrate the strength of the proposed condition for securing real-time voltage stability of large-scale high-voltage electric transmission systems.},
