With the Karhunen–Loève expansions, the stochastic volatility path (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process) is expressed as a sine series, and the time integrals of volatility and variance are analytically derived as infinite series of independent normal random variables. The new method is several hundred times faster than the existing method using numerical transform inversion. The simulation variance is further reduced with conditional simulation and the control variate.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by service systems where staffing decisions must be made before the arrival rate becomes known, we study the constraint satisfaction problem in an Erlang-A queue facing a random arrival rate. The objective is to find the minimum staffing level subject to a service level constraint that is modeled either (1) via an average constraint formulation that ensures a given quality-of-service (QoS) target holds on average by bounding the average fraction of abandoning customers below the said QoS target or (2) via a chance constraint formulation that ensures the QoS target for the random fraction of abandoning customers is met with high probability . Our primary contribution, under each constraint formulation, is to propose a policy that is shown to be universally optimal, i.e., irrespective of the magnitude of randomness in the arrival rate, the staffing gap between the proposed policy and the exact optimal policy remains bounded as the system size grows large. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first universal performance guarantee for constraint satisfaction in Erlang-A queues with random arrival rates and complements a recent result on cost minimization. The practical importance of this universality is that our proposed policy is a “one-size-fits-all” that is guaranteed to perform well for all levels of arrival rate uncertainty.},

Our method offers a general criterion for positivity-extendability, introduces an explicit lower bound game, and provides an understanding of the structure of extreme points in the extension set. These contributions significantly expand the toolkit for theoretical analyses and practical computations of incomplete cooperative games, and also shed new light on properties of classical cooperative games.},

The pairwise independent correlation gap is defined as the ratio of the maximum expected value of a set function with arbitrary dependence among the elements with fixed marginal probabilities to the maximum expected value with pairwise independent elements with the same marginal probabilities. We show that for any nonnegative monotone submodular set function defined on n elements, this ratio is upper bounded by 4/3 in the following two cases: (a) n = 3 for all marginal probabilities and (b) all n for small marginal probabilities (and similarly large marginal probabilities). This differs from the bound on the “correlation gap” which holds with mutual independence and showcases the fundamental difference between pairwise independence and mutual independence. We discuss the implication of the results with two examples and end the paper with a conjecture.},

We generalize this result by relaxing the smoothness condition, allowing the potential function to include a second part that is not necessarily smoothly concave but separably concave.},

Then we develop two approximation guarantees: one is asymptotically optimal as demand grows large, and the other provides a constant guarantee with metric fulfillment costs.},

When the server moves to a new station, it announces the next station to open based on a given discrete-time Markov chain. We calculate the expected waiting time for customers in each queue, which is shown to be monotonic with respect to their position in the queue. Personal optimal thresholds for the customers are then determined, and an optimal joining strategy is proposed based on these thresholds.},

Our work generalizes the important special case from Conforti et al. concerning 4-connected graphs with odd cycle transversal number at least 4. We also discuss the necessity of our assumptions.},
