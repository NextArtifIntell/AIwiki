  abstract     = {This paper proposes a shape transformation model based on the Allen-Cahn equation, and its numerical scheme. The model overcomes the limitations of previous shape transformation models by introducing a convective term, realizing a smooth and stable shape transformation when the initial shape is not in contact with the target shape. To solve the problem of high-dimensions and the complexity of nonlinear terms, the numerical scheme adopts the dimension-splitting method, which can accelerate the computation by parallel algorithm, and incorporate a first-order stabilization term to mitigate numerical instability from explicit nonlinear computations. The numerical experiments explore the effect of the attracting coefficient and illustrates the effectiveness of our method in dealing with the non-contact objects through model comparison. Finally, 2D and 3D transformations validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We propose a level set method for a Stokes eigenvalue optimization problem. A relaxed approach is employed first to approximate the Stokes eigenvalue problem and transform the original shape optimization problem into a topology optimization model. Then the distributed shape gradient is used in numerical algorithms based on a level set method. Single-grid and efficient two-grid level set algorithms are developed for the relaxed optimization problem. A two-grid mixed finite element scheme that has reliable accuracy and asymptotically optimal convergence is shown to improve the efficiency of the Stokes eigenvalue solver. Thus, it can save computational efforts of the whole optimization algorithm. Two and three-dimensional numerical results are reported to show effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In finite element methods for incompressible flows, the most popular approach to allow equal-order velocity-pressure pairs are residual-based stabilisations. When using first-order elements, however, the viscous part of the residual cannot be approximated, which often degrades accuracy. For constant viscosity, or by assuming a Lipschitz condition on the viscosity field, we can construct stabilisation methods that fully approximate the residual, regardless of the polynomial order of the finite element spaces. This work analyses and tests two variants of such a fully consistent approach, with the generalised Stokes system as a model problem. We prove unique solvability and derive expressions for the stabilisation parameter, generalising some classical results for constant viscosity. Numerical results illustrate how our method completely eliminates the spurious pressure boundary layers typically induced by low-order PSPG-like stabilisations.},

  abstract     = {The two-dimensional ( 2 D ) Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation offers a robust framework for studying complex, chaotic, and nonlinear dynamics in various mathematical and physical contexts. Analyzing this model also provides insights into higher-dimensional spatio-temporal chaotic systems that are relevant to many fields. This article aims to solve the scalar form of the two-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation using the H 1 − mixed Galerkin finite element method. By introducing an intermediate variable, the equation is transformed into a coupled system. This system is then approximated using the H 1 − mixed Galerkin finite element method, with the tensor product of the cubic B-spline in x and y directions serving as the test and trial functions in both the semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes. In this approach, triangularization is avoided, thereby reducing the size of the stiffness matrix. In the fully discrete scheme, the time derivative is approximated using the backward Euler method. The suitable linearization method is used to simplify the nonlinear term in both schemes. The theoretical analysis yields optimal order error estimates for the scalar unknown and its flux in the L 2 , L ∞ , and H 1 norms, demonstrating the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the proposed method. Additionally, three test problems are numerically analyzed to validate these theoretical results. The chaotic behavior of the equation is analyzed, in relation to the viscosity coefficient γ , and is also numerically investigated using the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a mixed spectral element method combined with second-order time stepping schemes for solving a two-dimensional nonlinear fourth-order fractional diffusion equation is constructed. For formulating an efficient numerical scheme, an auxiliary function is introduced to transform the fourth-order fractional system into a low-order coupled system, then the time direction is discretized by second-order FBT- θ schemes, and the spatial direction is approximated using the Legendre mixed spectral element method (LMSEM). The stability and the optimal error estimate with O ( τ 2 + h min ⁡ { N + 1 , r } N − r ) for the fully discrete scheme are derived, where τ stands for the time step size, h denotes the space step size, N indicates the degree of the polynomial, and r represents the order of Sobolev space. Finally, some numerical tests are carried out to verify the theory results and the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.},
