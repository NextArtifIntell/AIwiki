  abstract     = {The automatic differentiation (AD) in the vanilla physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is the computational bottleneck for the high-efficiency analysis. The concept of derivative discretization in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can provide an accelerated training method for PINNs. In this paper, smoothing kernel physics-informed neural networks (SK-PINNs) are established, which solve differential equations using smoothing kernel discretization. It is a robust framework capable of solving problems in the computational mechanics of complex domains. When the number of collocation points gradually increases, the training speed of SK-PINNs significantly surpasses that of vanilla PINNs. In cases involving large collocation point sets or higher-order problems, SK-PINN training can be up to tens of times faster than vanilla PINN. Additionally, analysis using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory shows that the convergence rates of SK-PINNs are consistent with those of vanilla PINNs. The superior performance of SK-PINNs is demonstrated through various examples, including regular and complex domains, as well as forward and inverse problems in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics.},

  abstract     = {A new paradigm for hybrid reliability-based design optimization (HRBDO) is proposed. The key innovation lies in expanding the traditional β -circle into a β -cylinder along the interval dimensions, integrating both random and interval dimensional information. Building upon this theoretical foundation, a novel interval-based dimensional expansion β -cylinder active learning (IBAL) method is proposed, transforming the complex double-loop reliability calculation into an efficient single-loop process. The method employs Kriging models to replace expensive physical responses. Unlike traditional sampling techniques, the IBAL method focuses exclusively on predicted means and deviations on the β -cylinder to guide the Kriging models of performance functions, efficiently identifying the Most Probable Point (MPP). This approach effectively addresses challenges including interval dimensions nonlinearity, multiple extreme points, and multiple MPPs. In HRBDO, the method incorporates an active constraint screening (ACS) mechanism and an MPP objective function isosurface active learning (MIAL) method to enhance computational efficiency and avoid convergence to local optima. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through four mathematical examples and one engineering case study.},

  abstract     = {The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.},

  abstract     = {Hourglass modes, characterized by zigzag particle and stress distributions, are a common numerical instability encountered when simulating solid materials with updated Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ULSPH). While recent solutions have effectively addressed this issue in elastic materials using an essentially non-hourglass formulation, extending these solutions to plastic materials with more complex constitutive equations has proven challenging due to the need to express shear forces in the form of a velocity Laplacian. To address this, a generalized non-hourglass formulation is proposed within the ULSPH framework, suitable for both elastic and plastic materials. Specifically, a penalty force is introduced into the momentum equation to resolve the disparity between the linearly predicted and actual velocity differences of neighboring particle pairs, thereby mitigating the hourglass issue. The stability, convergence, and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through a series of classical elastic and plastic cases, with a dual-criterion time-stepping scheme to improve computational efficiency. The results show that the present method not only matches or even surpasses the performance of the recent essentially non-hourglass formulation in elastic cases but also performs well in plastic scenarios.},

Notably, the ill-posed nature of large-scale parameter identification from refined models has become a critical technical challenge. Regularization methods are widely employed to mitigate ill-posedness and control the complexity of identification problems. Traditional regularization methods often penalize imbalances in damage parameters, leading to errors and suboptimal convergence, failing to accurately reflect actual damage conditions. To address these challenges, an information entropy regularization term is introduced to capture the distribution of structural damage location and severity. By integrating regularization term with an adjoint sensitivity optimization algorithm, a refined iterative approach is developed to manage large-scale damage parameter identification from detailed finite element models. Numerical analyses on a 2D stress plate and a 3D wing, along with experimental validation on impact damage of clamped plates, demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Microstructural evolution, particularly grain growth, plays a critical role in shaping the physical, optical, and electronic properties of materials. Traditional phase-field modeling accurately simulates these phenomena but is computationally intensive, especially for large systems and fine spatial resolutions. While machine learning approaches have been employed to accelerate simulations, they often struggle with resolution dependence and generalization across different grain scales. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to achieve resolution-invariant modeling of microstructure evolution in multi-grain systems. FNO operates in the Fourier space and can inherently handle varying resolutions by learning mappings between function spaces. By integrating FNO with the phase-field method, we developed a surrogate model that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high accuracy across different spatial scales. We generated a comprehensive dataset from phase-field simulations using the Fan–Chen model, capturing grain evolution over time. Data preparation involved creating input–output pairs with a time shift, allowing the model to predict future microstructures based on current and past states. The FNO-based neural network was trained using sequences of microstructures and demonstrated remarkable accuracy in predicting long-term evolution, even for unseen configurations and higher-resolution grids not encountered during training.},

However, accurately and efficiently estimating the structural response in the face of random measurement errors, structural uncertainty, and nonlinear effects remains a challenge. In this study, a novel key conditional quotient (KCQ) theory has been presented to tackle this challenge. By extracting key conditions from measurement data and applying the principle of probability conservation, the KCQ theory provides an precise quotient-form expression, i.e., KCQ, for estimating the structural response considering random measurement errors, structural uncertainty, and nonlinearity. To effectively extract key measurement conditions, this study also proposes two innovative methods: the strong correlation measurement points method, and the covariance matrix of measurement errors method. To accurately and efficiently estimating the KCQ, a numerical method by combining the generalized quasi-Monte Carlo method based on the generalized center discrepancy and an offline-online coupling computational strategy is proposed. Five numerical examples are provided to verify the precision, efficiency, and robustness against measurement errors of the proposed KCQ theory and numerical method.},

  abstract     = {The current Bayesian FFT algorithm relies on direct differentiation to obtain the posterior covariance matrix (PCM), which is time-consuming, memory-intensive, and hard to code, especially for the multi-setup operational modal analysis (OMA). Aiming at accelerating the uncertainty quantification in multi-setup OMA, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based algorithm is proposed by reformulating the Hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood function (NLLF) as a sum of simplified components corresponding to the complete-data NLLF. Matrix calculus is employed to derive these components in a compact manner, resulting in expressions similar to those in the single-setup case. This similarity allows for the reuse of existing Bayesian single-setup OMA codes, simplifying implementation. The singularity caused by mode shape norm constraints is addressed through null space projection, eliminating potential numerical errors from the conventional pseudoinverse operation. A sparse assembly strategy is further adopted, avoiding unnecessary calculations and storage of predominant zero elements in the Hessian matrix. The proposed method is then validated through a comprehensive parametric study and applied to a multi-setup OMA of a high-rise building. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently calculates the PCM within seconds, even for cases with hundreds of parameters. This represents an efficiency improvement of at least one order of magnitude over the state-of-the-art method. Such performance paves the way for a real-time modal identification of large-scale structures, including those with closely-spaced modes.},

To further apply the NCDDAM for seismic dynamic analysis, this paper introduces five boundary conditions: viscous boundary, viscoelasticity boundary, seismic input boundary, free field boundary, and static-dynamic unified boundary. Several numerical examples are conduced to validate the enriched NCDDAM. The numerical results demonstrate the capacity of the enriched NCDDAM for seismic dynamic analysis of rock masses. The nonreflecting boundaries applied in NCDDAM can effectively absorb wave energy and avoid fictitious scattered waves, while the free field boundary applied in NCDDAM effectively simulates wave propagation in a semi-infinite domain. Based on the static-dynamic unified boundary, the seamless transition of boundary condition settings between the quasi-static and dynamic stages can be achieved. The entire evolution process of earthquake-induced disasters, including initiation, movement, run-out, and deposition can be effectively simulated within a unified framework using the enriched NCDDAM.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for accurate material behaviour data in engineering simulations has exposed the limitations of traditional constitutive models. Although recent advances in full-field measurement techniques provide more detailed material characterization, conventional approaches still heavily rely on explicit assumptions and labour-intensive experimentation. This paper revisits the indirect training methodology introduced by the authors [1] , which integrates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Gated-Recurrent Units (GRUs) and the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to model material behaviour without labelled data. The earlier study demonstrated the feasibility of training a GRU-based RNN using only global force and strain data through the VFM. Building on those findings, this work presents a more robust approach featuring an improved network architecture, with residual connections to enhance gradient flow and training stability, while also incorporating physics-based constraints. Extensive hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize the model and a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of the virtual fields on the accuracy and training dynamics. The models were validated using additional heterogeneous mechanical tests and the Reconstructed Axial Force Ratio (RAFR), as a key performance indicator, to further assess the physical correctness. The results show enhanced predictive accuracy and improved force reconstruction when larger sets of virtual fields are employed. Additionally, normalizing the VFM loss contributed to more consistent predictions and force reconstruction across all time stages. Stress contour plots further confirm the model’s ability to accurately predict stress distributions, which are in good agreement with the reference, with low median and average absolute errors.},

We demonstrate that Augmented Riemann solvers can be incorporated into the PINN framework with straightforward adjustments to the hyperparameters, providing a promising alternative to automatic differentiation (AD), especially in cases where the solution exhibits strong nonlinearities and physical constraints are required. Benefits of the proposed RoePINN compared with the vanilla PINN based in AD are twofold: on the one hand, this hybrid approach employs numerical differentiation by means of support points in the surroundings of the collocation points, hence the robustness, generalization capacity and tunability of the PINNs are, in most cases, largely enhanced. On the other hand, the RoePINN incorporates the numerical solver, hence it is also capable of capturing sharp discontinuities with an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy compared with the vanilla version.},

  abstract     = {Shallow water equations (SWE) are fundamental nonlinear hyperbolic PDE-based models in fluid dynamics that are essential for studying a wide range of geophysical and engineering phenomena. Therefore, stable and accurate numerical methods for SWE are needed. Although some algorithms are well studied for deterministic SWE, more effort should be devoted to handling the SWE with uncertainty. In this paper, we incorporate uncertainty through a stochastic Galerkin (SG) framework, and building on an existing hyperbolicity-preserving SG formulation for 2D SWE, we construct the corresponding entropy flux pair, and develop structure-preserving, well-balanced, second-order energy conservative and energy stable finite volume schemes for the SG formulation of the two-dimensional shallow water system. We demonstrate the efficacy, applicability, and robustness of these structure-preserving algorithms through several challenging numerical experiments.},

However, the vanilla EnKF framework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two non-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF – dubbed the conditional-Gaussian EnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) – which sidestep assumptions of linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the ‘conditional Gaussian’ update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these models against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called the score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for estimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation operator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF dramatically outperform SF for two canonical systems in data assimilation: the Lorenz-96 system and a double well potential system. Our analysis also demonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian additive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the former.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), as a novel neural network model, is known for its strong interpretability and generalization capabilities, making it widely used in surrogate models and various engineering scenarios. While traditional PINN has achieved good results in simple geometric scenarios, there is limited research on its application to complex geometric structures. Additionally, PINN integrates boundary conditions into the loss function, requiring retraining model when boundary conditions change. To address these issues, we propose a new Physics-Informed Graph Ordinary Differential Equation (PIGODE) model for constructing surrogate models in complex geometric structures. The Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO) is extended to a PIGODE which is defined on graph data structure, and a PDDO-based message passing layer is developed to replace automatic differentiation (AD). This method precomputes Peridynamic weights, thereby avoiding additional computational overhead during model training. Furthermore, boundary conditions are embedded into the model input to address the need for dynamically modifying boundary conditions in surrogate models. Through comparative studies with existing PINN solvers, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, demonstrating its superior performance on complex geometric structures. Additionally, this model is applied to practical engineering scenarios, specifically constructing a temperature field surrogate model for the conical picks of a tunnel boring machine. The research results indicate that the proposed PIGODE model not only enhances the interpretability and efficiency of surrogate models but also extends their applicability to complex geometric structures in engineering.},

Unlike traditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and resolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial mesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying contact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited for developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving growing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we extend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By leveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define normal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the linear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation allows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled solely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We thoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples. The method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture the stick–slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation, offering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.},

After validating the finite element modeling method, an extensive stochastic finite element analysis is conducted to construct a comprehensive capacity database. The hyperparameters for the DNN architecture are initially determined, balancing accuracy with model complexity to finalize the surrogate capacity models. However, due to the strong nonlinearity in deformation-related surrogate models, lower accuracies are observed, which are further improved by applying a logarithmic transformation and the more advanced Transformer model. Despite these enhancements, the accuracy achieved by standard DNNs remains the most optimal, indicating their suitability for this task. Considering uncertainties in input features and neural network hyperparameters, fragility estimates for example RCFs are rapidly predicted using the surrogate capacity models.

  abstract     = {Numerical simulation of the collision dynamics in thin-walled structures under oblique load involves complex spatiotemporal processes, including material, geometric, and contact nonlinearities, which often require significant computational resources and time. Moreover, predicting high-dimensional spatiotemporal responses remains a challenge for most surrogate-based models. This paper proposes a deep learning framework based on manifold learning for spatiotemporal modeling of collision dynamics in thin-walled structures under oblique load. The framework leverages multiple deep learning models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Radial Basis Function Interpolation (RBFI), and regression Residual Network (ResNet18), to capture the complex nonlinearities inherent in structural deformation, stress distribution, and crush force, enabling continuous prediction of multimodal spatiotemporal responses. Using a rectangular thin-walled tube under oblique load as an example, the models are validated with simulation data, yielding average prediction errors of 5.80 % for structural deformation, 6.01 % for Energy Absorption (EA), 10.66 % for Peak Crush Force (PCF), and 16.66 % for crush force. Compared to traditional finite element (FE) simulations, prediction time is reduced by 98.6 % for structural deformation and stress distribution, and 97.4 % for crush force. Additionally, the method demonstrates stability and broad applicability across different design parameters and structural configurations, including rectangular and double-cell tubes. This work underscores the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance computational efficiency and predictive accuracy in the crashworthiness design of thin-walled structures.},

  abstract     = {Finite-thickness interphases between different constituents in heterogeneous materials are often replaced by a zero-thickness interface model. Due to increasing area-to-volume ratio with decreasing size of microstructures, interfaces introduce a physical length into the effective response at the macroscale. The most commonly studied interface models are the cohesive interface model and the elastic interface model . The cohesive interface model allows for a displacement jump across the interface, in contrast to the elastic interface model that requires displacement continuity across the interface. The classical general interface model assumes that the interface displacement itself must coincide with the displacement average across the interface. The recently proposed extended general interface model defines the interface displacement kinematically via the weighted average of displacement across the interface. Here, we propose a canonical interface model based on a variationally consistent approach, which encompasses all previous interface models. We implement our model with the finite element method and illustrate its consequences through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, variationally consistent homogenization is employed to upscale an elastic composite with particles surrounded by a canonical interface and embedded in a matrix. The numerical results highlight the significance of the canonical interface model on the overall response of composites, at times leading to counter-intuitive behavior at the macroscale.},

The proposed method employs a novel information-theoretic criterion to measure the relative importance of dimensionless quantities, whereas the existing methodologies rely on sensitivity/derivative-based measures. This entropy-based measure provides two significant advantages: (1) invariance (objectivity) with respect to reparametrizations of variables, and (2) robustness against outliers. Numerical results show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in these aspects, and enables identifying dominant dimensionless quantities.

The necessity for robust solvers for junctions in networks is evident from the extensive literature and the variety of proposed methods. While multidimensional coupled approaches that model junctions as two-dimensional spaces have shown success, they lack the computational efficiency of pure 1D methods that treat junctions as singular points. In this context, existing JRP-based methods have primarily been limited to subcritical flow regimes. For the first time, this paper demonstrates that the Junction Riemann Problem can be effectively used as an internal boundary condition across all flow regimes representing a junction of channels. The proposed JRP solution is both simple and robust, accommodating various flow regimes and an arbitrary number of channels without requiring additional information. Furthermore, it is shown that the JRP can be solved efficiently at internal boundaries and integrated with a standard first-order Godunov scheme to yield accurate results. The validation of this method is confirmed through a series of test cases, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling free-surface flows.},

The hexagonal quadrature scheme is fitted to correctly integrate the stored energy density within the nonlocal finite-sized neighborhood of a continuum point subject to affine expansion. Our proposed hexagonal quadrature scheme is grid-independent by relying on appropriate interpolation of pertinent quantities from collocation to quadrature points. In this contribution, we discuss linear and quadratic interpolations and compare our novel hexagonal quadrature scheme to common grid-dependent quadrature schemes. For this, we consider both, tetragonal and hexagonal discretizations of the domain. The accuracy of the presented quadrature schemes is first evaluated and compared by computing the stored energy density of various prescribed affine deformations within the nonlocal neighborhood. Furthermore, we perform three different boundary value problems, where we measure the effective Poisson’s ratio resulting from each quadrature scheme and evaluate the deformation of a unit square under extension and beam bending. Key findings of our studies are: The Poisson’s test is a good indicator for the convergence behavior of quadrature schemes with respect to the grid density. The accuracy of quadrature schemes depends, as expected, on their ability to appropriately capture the deformation within the nonlocal neighborhood. Our novel hexagonal quadrature scheme, rendering the correct effective Poisson’s ratio of 1 / 3 for small deformations, together with quadratic interpolation consequently yields the most accurate results for the studies presented in this contribution, thereby effectively reducing the computational cost.},

We then propose a slight modification that makes the ESFEM inherently applicable to negative-Jacobian Q4 elements without requiring any ad hoc stabilization. For the ESFEM, a smoothing cell (SC) attached to negative-Jacobian Q4 element is rebuilt on the midpoint of the shorter diagonal of the damaged element. Thus, the SC has a positive area that accounts correctly for inertial effects of transient problems. Such a treatment is compatible with the regular procedure for constructing an edge-based SC in normal Q4 elements. The mesh insensitivity of the ESFEM is highlighted by solving fluid–structure interaction on negative-Jacobian Q4 elements. Importantly, the present scheme can be generalized to other linear n -sided elements which are more likely to be badly distorted in complex moving-domain problems.},

This approach explores the use of non-planar layers, leveraging the increased manufacturing flexibility provided by robotic arms. Additionally, our method allows for the concurrent optimization of the structural layout and corresponding fabrication sequence. We employ the inherent strain method as a simplified process simulation model to predict residual stresses and distortions.

  abstract     = {Real-time accurate solutions of large-scale complex dynamical systems are critically needed for control, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and decision-making in practical engineering and science applications, particularly in digital twin contexts. Recent research on hybrid approaches combining numerical methods and machine learning in end-to-end training has shown significant improvements over either approach alone. However, using neural networks as surrogate models generally exhibits limitations in generalizability over different settings and in capturing the evolution of solution discontinuities. In this work, we develop a model-constrained discontinuous Galerkin Network ( DGNet ) approach, a significant extension to our previous work (Nguyen and Bui-Thanh, 2022), for compressible Euler equations with out-of-distribution generalization. The core of DGNet is the synergy of several key strategies: (i) leveraging time integration schemes to capture temporal correlation and taking advantage of neural network speed for computation time reduction. This is the key to the temporal discretization-invariant property of DGNet ; (ii) employing a model-constrained approach to ensure the learned tangent slope satisfies governing equations; (iii) utilizing a DG-inspired architecture for GNN where edges represent Riemann solver surrogate models and nodes represent volume integration correction surrogate models, enabling capturing discontinuity capability, aliasing error reduction, and mesh discretization generalizability. Such a design allows DGNet to learn the DG spatial discretization accurately; (iv) developing an input normalization strategy that allows surrogate models to generalize across different initial conditions, geometries, meshes, boundary conditions, and solution orders. In fact, the normalization is the key to spatial discretization-invariance for DGNet ; and (v) incorporating a data randomization technique that not only implicitly promotes agreement between surrogate models and true numerical models up to second-order derivatives, ensuring long-term stability and prediction capacity, but also serves as a data generation engine during training, leading to enhanced generalization on unseen data. To validate the theoretical results, effectiveness, stability, and generalizability of our novel DGNet approach, we present comprehensive numerical results for 1D and 2D compressible Euler equation problems, including Sod Shock Tube, Lax Shock Tube, Isentropic Vortex, Forward Facing Step, Scramjet, Airfoil, Euler Benchmarks, Double Mach Reflection, and a Hypersonic Sphere Cone benchmark.},

  abstract     = {We present a hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian method for the direct simulation of three-dimensional, heterogeneous, active, and self-propelling structures made of soft fibers and operating in incompressible viscous flows. Fiber-based organization of matter is pervasive in nature and engineering, from biological architectures made of cilia, hair, muscles or bones to polymers, composite materials or soft robots. In nature, many such structures are adapted to manipulate flows for feeding, swimming or energy harvesting, through mechanisms that are often not fully understood. While simulations can support the analysis (and subsequent translational engineering) of these systems, extreme fibers’ aspect-ratios, large elastic deformations, two-way coupling with three-dimensional flows, and self-propulsion all render the problem numerically challenging. To address this, we couple Cosserat rod theory, where fibers’ dynamics is accurately captured in one-dimensional fashion, with the velocity–vorticity formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations, through a virtual boundary technique. The favorable properties of the resultant hydroelastic solver are demonstrated against a battery of benchmarks, and further showcased in a range of multi-physics scenarios, involving magnetic actuation, viscous streaming, biomechanics, multi-body interaction, and untethered swimming.},

  abstract     = {The Parrot Optimization Algorithm (PO) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm developed based on the social and adaptive behaviors of Pyrrhura molinae parrots. PO demonstrates robust optimization performance by balancing exploration and exploitation, mimicking foraging and cooperative activities. However, as the algorithm progresses through iterations, it faces critical challenges in maintaining search diversity and movement efficiency diminishes, leading to premature convergence and a reduced ability to find optimal solutions in complex search space. To address these limitations, this work introduces the Dynamic Turbulent-based Parrot Optimization Algorithm (DTPO), which represents a significant advancement over the original PO by incorporating three novel strategies: a novel Differential Mutation (DM), Dynamic Opposite Learning (DOL), and Turbulent Operator (TO). The DM Strategy enhances exploration by introducing controlled variations in the population, allowing DTPO to escape local optima. Also, the DOL Strategy dynamically generates opposite solutions to refresh stagnated populations, expanding the search space and maintaining adaptability. Finally, the TO strategy simulates chaotic movements inspired by turbulence, ensuring a thorough local search while preserving population diversity. Together, these strategies improve the algorithm&#39;s ability to explore, exploit, and converge efficiently. Furthermore, the DTPO&#39;s performance was rigorously evaluated on benchmark functions from CEC2017 and CEC2022, comparing it against 23 state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate DTPO&#39;s superior convergence speed, search efficiency, and optimization accuracy. Additionally, DTPO was tested on seven engineering design problems, achieving significant improvements over the original PO algorithm, with superior performance gains compared to other algorithms in real-world scenarios. Particularly, DTPO outperformed competing algorithms in 37 out of 41 benchmark functions, achieving an overall success rate of 90.24%. Moreover, DTPO obtained the best Friedman ranks across all comparisons, with values ranging from 3.03 to 1.18, demonstrating its superiority over classical, advanced, and recent algorithms. These results validate the proposed enhancements and highlight DTPO&#39;s robustness and effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Recently, several topology optimization methods in the Lagrangian or Eulerian description has accepted a wide of discussions, which have been applied to several design problems. In the current work, the primary intention is to propose the Particle Flow Topology Optimization (PFTO) approach in a Lagrangian-Eulerian description, which can sufficiently unify their unique characteristics and superiorities for the optimization with a higher effectiveness. Firstly, an Isogeometric Material Points Method (I-MPM) is applied to develop the numerical analysis framework for particles to solve the static equilibrium equation, which can maintain the consistency of geometrical model and analysis model using the same NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) basis functions. Secondly, a Lagrangian-Eulerian particle flow model is proposed for representing structural topology in the optimization, which consists of several critical components, namely the mappings of physical information (P2C: Particles to Control points, C2G: Control points to Gauss quadrature points), the inverse mappings of sensitivity information (G2C and C2P). Thirdly, the mathematical formulation for the maximization of structural loading-capability is developed using the PFTO approach, in which physical positions and material consumptions of particles are design variables to drive the evolvement of structural topology. The sensitivity analysis of the objective and constraint functions with respect to design variables at particles, namely physical information is derived in detail. Finally, several numerical design examples in 2D and 3D are performed to demonstrate the validity, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed PFTO approach, and the indispensability of particles movement for the optimization is also sufficiently studied.},

  abstract     = {In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing structures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance while balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy absorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world conditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the non-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant computational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to optimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid structures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and efficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced structural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush performance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic conditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often require a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions, making the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context, multi-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by intelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to reduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the complexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element analysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study tackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak force, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical role. Leveraging scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques, the framework effectively identifies Pareto-optimal solutions that balance these conflicting objectives while accounting for the complexities of plastic material behaviour. Importantly, the approach also prevents problematic densification, ensuring structural integrity during impact. The results not only demonstrate the framework’s ability to outperform the NSGA-II algorithm but also highlight its potential for wider applications in structural and material optimisation. The framework’s adaptability to various design requirements underscores its capability to address complex, multi-objective optimisation challenges associated with real-world conditions.},

  abstract     = {In engineering systems, a digital twin serves as a digital replica encompassing both physical assets and their associated processes, such as manufacturing and certification. The implementation of digital twins offers substantial potential for various applications, including improved design, enhanced collaboration, effective energy management, risk mitigation, lifecycle management, and predictive maintenance. However, existing definitions of a “twin” are often ambiguous and lack a structured approach for developing digital twins, particularly for systems with unknown inputs. This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a clear definition and a robust methodology for building digital twins. Our methodology integrates projection-based model order reduction, a rapid approach for identifying unknown inputs, and a non-parametric probabilistic method for modeling and quantifying model-form uncertainty. Additionally, it incorporates a probabilistic learning approach for performing stochastic model updating. The effectiveness of this digital twinning methodology is illustrated through a case study involving an elevated truss footbridge located at the Autodesk Research facility at Pier 9 in San Francisco with unknown inputs. This case study underscores the importance of accurately modeling uncertainty to enhance the performance and reliability of digital twins in real-world engineering applications.},

In this article, hierarchical unit-cells are obtained, where features at each length scale result in a band gap within a targeted frequency range. Our novel approach, the “hierarchical unit-cell template method,” is an interpretable machine-learning approach that uncovers global unit-cell shape/topology patterns corresponding to predefined band-gap objectives. A scale-separation effect is observed where the coarse-scale band-gap objective is mostly unaffected by the fine-scale features despite the closeness of their length scales, thus enabling an efficient hierarchical algorithm. Moreover, the hierarchical patterns revealed are not predefined or self-similar hierarchies as common in current hierarchical phononic materials. Thus, our approach offers a flexible and efficient method for the exploration of new regions in the hierarchical design space, extracting minimal effective patterns for inverse design in applications targeting multiple frequency ranges.},
