  abstract     = {Contemporary research has leveraged social network data as a predictive tool for decision-making process in the capital market. Yet, its effectiveness may be compromised by social contagion. This study addresses this problem by introducing conversation-level measures that capture how interactions among investors affect market predictions. Drawing on social contagion theory, we identified three conversation conditions—argument similarity, sentiment similarity, and conversation size—and examined their association with the likelihood of abrupt stock price changes, which indicate a loss of collective wisdom. Our analysis of 18 million StockTwits posts for 859 Initial Public Offerings (2008–2017) reveals that conversations with highly similar arguments, highly similar sentiments, and larger size are significantly associated with an increased likelihood of abrupt stock price changes in the subsequent week. Moreover, out-of-sample tests confirm that monitoring conversational dynamics enhances the predictive power of social network analytics, offering valuable guidance for investors and practitioners. Our study extends the theoretical framework of social contagion by highlighting the importance of the conversation level and provides practical recommendations for refining trading strategies based on social media data.},

  abstract     = {While some donors and volunteers do not publicize their prosocial behaviors because of humility, many others fear that disclosing their prosocial behaviors may be perceived as bragging. With the rise of social networking sites (SNSs), this has become an essential issue with important business implications. As more companies encourage employees to volunteer a small portion of their work time and match their charitable contributions, disclosing these prosocial acts on social media platforms has become more common. Building upon social capital theory, we apply a mixed-method approach to investigate the relationship between the disclosure of prosocial behaviors and the attainment of social capital on SNSs. Our first exploratory study applies qualitative interviews to explore the factors that moderate the relationship between the disclosure of prosocial behaviors and the attainment of social capital. Our second study utilizes a randomized online experiment in the U.S. to test the causal effect of prosocial behavior disclosure on social capital attainment online, as well as two moderators of this relationship. A post-hoc replication study of our experiment is conducted in China. We find that the disclosure of prosocial behavior increases relational and structural social capital on SNSs but find no evidence of the impact of the disclosure of prosocial behavior on cognitive social capital. The effect becomes stronger when one&#39;s prosocial behavior is disclosed by others (rather than by oneself) in the U.S. sample. Our findings inform SNSs users to make informed decisions regarding disclosing prosocial behaviors to attain structural and relational social capital. Businesses encouraging their employees to donate/volunteer and charities on the receiving end could also benefit from our findings.},

  abstract     = {User engagement (e.g., likes, shares, and comments) is widely recognized as critical to business success. Although existing studies have explored the determinants of user engagement, relatively little attention has been paid to cognitive load. This study, based on cognitive load theory, expectation confirmation theory, and the stressor-strain-outcome framework, examines the heterogeneous effects of intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load on user engagement in Study 1, the moderating effects of intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load variance (i.e., described as cognitive load changes induced by processing from one review to another review) in Study 1, and their underlying mechanisms in Study 2. Results indicate that: (1) intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load negatively influence user engagement, while germane cognitive load has a positive effect, (2) intrinsic/extraneous cognitive load variance accentuates the negative effect of intrinsic/extraneous cognitive load, while germane cognitive load variance strengthens the positive effect of germane cognitive load, and (3) perceived fatigue negatively mediates the effects of intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load but positively mediates the effect of germane cognitive load. Our findings contribute to the literature on user engagement and offer practical insights for optimizing online review systems.},

  abstract     = {Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is a widely used method for estimating causal treatment effects, but its performance can be limited in complex scenarios. This paper examines cases where a confounder also serves as an effect modifier and compares the bias-reduction performance of PSM with Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW). Using the University of California, Berkeley graduate admission data as an illustrative example, we show that PSM can produce biased estimates of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in such contexts. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that PSM generally fails to adequately reduce bias for the ATE when a confounder is also an effect modifier, while IPW yields less biased estimates with lower Mean Squared Error (MSE). To validate these findings in a more real-world setting, we analyse data generated from a well-known matched-pairs experimental study of Mexico&#39;s Seguro Popular de Salud (Universal Health Insurance) Program. From this experiment we derive observational data that incorporates confounders and effect modifiers and compare the performance of PSM and IPW estimators. Our results confirm that IPW consistently provides more accurate and reliable estimates of the ATE, with smaller bias, compared to PSM.},

Whether to purchase external consumer data. <em>DSS</em>, <em>192</em>,

  abstract     = {By utilizing consumer behavioral data, targeted ads can enhance the click-through rates (CTRs) but, at the same time, cause consumer privacy concerns. In this paper, we investigate whether a streaming platform should purchase external consumer data to improve ad-targeting levels, whereby it gain revenue from cost-per-mille (CPM) and cost-per-click (CPC) advertising. We explore how advertising intensity and consumer advertising fatigue interactively determine the data purchase decision and the optimal ad-targeting level of the streaming platform. Our findings indicate that the platform with low advertising intensity or high consumer advertising fatigue is more likely to purchase external consumer data because the ad-driven CTRs are low in these cases. An unexpected finding is that the amount of consumer data purchased by the platform increases with the intensity of privacy concern when advertising intensity is low or when both advertising intensity and fatigue level are high. In these scenarios, the privacy invasion effect resulting from purchasing external consumer data is low due to the low ad-driven CTRs. After purchasing consumer data, to compensate for the privacy invasion effect of targeted ads on consumers, the platform should lower the advertising intensity if and only if the advertising fatigue level is low. Furthermore, we demonstrate that if the platform simultaneously decides on advertising intensity and ad-targeting level, purchasing external consumer data results in a Pareto improvement when the organic CTR is low, benefiting both consumers and the streaming platform. Our findings highlight the importance of balancing advertising precision and consumer privacy on a streaming platform.},
