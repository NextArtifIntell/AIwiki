  abstract     = {Rapid and accurate upper-limb motion analysis and metrics are essential for enhancing exercise medicine knowledge graph to drive personalised medicine. However, current studies face limitations in understanding multi-timescale and multi-target, compounded by discrepancies in physiological structure. This study proposes Upper-Limb Dynamic Warping (UP-Ldw), which effectively responds to motion discrepancies and adapts to the physiological characteristics. UP-Ldw constructs a geometric model by parameterizing features and incorporating physiological structure parameters to accommodate individual variations. Dynamic temporal regularization is integrated to accommodate motion sequences across multiple time scales. Ultimately, the motion similarity among various targets is outputted to facilitate comparison and metrics. Furthermore, two datasets are developed: Upper-Limb 3-Dimensional Dataset (UP-L-3D), and Upper-Limb Geometric Modeling Dataset (UP-L-GM), both utilized for validation. Comparison experiments employed convolutional neural network (CNN), principal component analysis (PCA), and random forests. Results demonstrate that UP-Ldw achieves the highest accuracy of 97.92 % using metrics 20 as the discriminant criterion, with a short running time of 1–8 ms. UP-Ldw aligned with CNN confusion matrices and the PCA downscaling, validating its precise motion analysis. The Random Forest model attained an average accuracy of 91.1 %, confirming the validity of the geometric model. A generalization experiment was conducted using the public dataset Arm-CODA, further validating UP-Ldw&#39;s ability to adapt to physiological structures and effectively metricize upper-limb motion. Overall, UP-Ldw employs artificial intelligence to metricize motion, facilitating mirror rehabilitation. This advancement contributes significantly to the engineering applications of personalised healthcare and exercise rehabilitation.},

Firstly, an algorithm is designed to autonomously assign team roles to follower robots in a distributed fashion, thereby generating a virtual goal pose for each follower. Secondly, a combination of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller, based on the Ackermann model, and a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller is developed for lateral and longitudinal distance control of each robot. Subsequently, an improved Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm is utilized to expedite the training process and enable real-time online parameter optimization of the LQR controller. Finally, the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2)-based formation system and experimental setup are presented, along with a detailed description of the A3C training process. According to both simulation and real-vehicle experiments, the formation control method proposed in this paper demonstrates stable operation and high accuracy in formation maintenance, surpassing other similar methods and the traditional LQR approach.},

  abstract     = {Daily inspection as a top priority to ensure the safe production of intelligent workshops, can directly respond to the degree of intelligence of the factory workshop, which often needs robots to inspect multiple target devices. To enhance the inspection quality of intelligent workshop inspection robots, this thesis is based on the Informed-Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm and introduces the concept of simultaneous expansion of multiple trees. This paper proposes a strategy involving random tree connectivity to the Multi-Informed-RRT∗ (MI-RRT∗) global path planning algorithm, which is suitable for multi-objective point planning. It is verified through simulation that in solving the same planning problem for eight objective points, compared with the basic Informed-RRT∗ algorithm, the MI-RRT∗ algorithm&#39;s running time is reduced by 79.56 %, and the final generated path length is reduced by 25.26 %; compared with the Multi-RRT∗ algorithm, which is also used for solving the multi-objective point planning problem, the running time of the algorithm is reduced by 48.48 % and the final generated path length is reduced by 7.45 %. In conclusion, this study proposes a multi-objective point path planning algorithm tailored for the dynamic environment of intelligent workshops, achieved through the integration of MI-RRT∗ and an enhanced Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithm. Experimental evidence substantiates that the path generated by the MI-RRT∗ algorithm, as presented in this paper, is superior, resulting in shorter robot running times and a substantial enhancement in inspection efficiency within the workshop. Simultaneously, it mitigates the issue of traditional inspection equipment leakage, thereby possessing tangible practical value.},

  abstract     = {The detection and classification of power quality disturbances (PQDs) carries significant importance for power systems. In response to this imperative, numerous intelligent diagnostic methods have been developed. However, existing identification methods usually concentrate on single-type signals or on complex signals with two types, rendering them susceptible to noisy labels and environmental effects. This study proposes a novel method for the classification of PQDs, named Stockwell transform-Grouped convolution Squeeze-and-excitation Residual Network (ST-GSResNet), which utilizes the Stockwell transform (S-Transform) and an improved residual network (ResNet) with a channel attention mechanism. The ST-GSResNet approach initially uses the S-Transform to transform a time-series signal into a two-dimensional (2D) time–frequency image for feature enhancement. Then, an improved ResNet model is introduced, which employs grouped convolution instead of the traditional convolution operation. This improvement aims to facilitate learning with a block-diagonal structured sparsity on the channel dimension, the highly-correlated filters are learned in a more structured way in the networks with filter groups. By reducing the number of parameters in the network in this significant manner, the model becomes less prone to overfitting. Furthermore, the channel attention mechanism (squeeze-and-excitation module) concentrates on primary components, which enhances the model’s robustness in recognition and immunity to noise. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing deep learning models, our approach has advantages in computational efficiency and classification accuracy.},

Although some researches using back propagation neural network to predict the robotic arm&#39;s absolute positioning error have been proved, they suffer from poor convergence and low prediction accuracy in that input parameters contain unavoidable measurement errors. This paper proposed an error prediction model based on fuzzification and back propagation neural network. The rotation angle and direction of robotic joints are employed as training samples for the back propagation neural network, and converted into error contributions using the fuzzification to eliminate the influence of measurement errors in the input parameters. The input parameters are simplified, which enables the training process of the back propagation neural network to be optimized. Experimental results showed that the training time of the model was reduced by two times or more, and the mean square error was decreased by roughly 2.94 %. Meanwhile, the average absolute positioning error of the robotic arm with the prediction model was reduced by 59.22 %. The model can be easily transplanted into embedded systems to provide a methodology for new design of robotic arm error compensators.},

The existing literature faces challenges such as limited focus on the automation of Requirement Elicitation (RE), insufficient task-specific fine-tuning of models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and lack of interpretability owing to the black-box nature of these models. Therefore, our work makes the following significant contributions to address these challenges: (1) development and evaluation of a robust method based on ABSA for the automation of the RE process; (2) optimization of ABSA using BERT fine-tuning for enhanced performance, which includes conducting a comprehensive ablation study to obtain the best hyperparameters that guarantee the best model performance and robustness; and (3) integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques for enhanced BERT model interpretability. Our work was evaluated on the ABSA Warehouse of Apps REviews (AWARE) dataset, a specifically tailored dataset for the RE process. Our study outperformed baseline models such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and BERT, and achieved an average F1-Score of 0.83 for the Aspect Category Detection (ACD) task and 0.94 for the Aspect Category Polarity (ACP) task. In addition, we employed XAI using Locally Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to explain the BERT model prediction results, which aids in the improved visualization and interpretability of the app review analysis for the automated RE process.},

  abstract     = {It is a crucial task to predict the algorithmic time complexity for estimating the efficiency of a software code. Since the problem is known to be undecidable in theory, there is no 100% accurate tools to solve the problem. Even humans often make mistakes when analyzing the time complexity of code, and this process requires considerable effort and time to thoroughly examine the code. Therefore, we aim to develop an automated method for analyzing code time complexity. We observe that solution codes submitted for coding problems in competitive programming contests tend to have similar time complexities due to constraints such as time limits and functional requirements of the problems. Based on this observation, we propose a contrastive learning-based training strategy that aligns solution codes for the same competitive programming problem. Our training strategy clusters codes with similar time complexities by using both natural language problem descriptions and a single reference code per problem as anchors. This design enables the model to capture core algorithmic features such as loops and recursion more accurately. Experiments in three scenarios – in-dataset, cross-dataset, and cross-language – demonstrate substantial gains on pre-trained code models, consistently surpassing existing methods in both accuracy and generalizability. Our proposed training strategy yields an average 12.54% improvement over cross-entropy-based training, and an 8.01% improvement over data augmentation-based contrastive learning.},

To alleviate these shortcomings, we present a novel ABC algorithm that combines cumulative binomial probability (CBABC), which contains two versions, single-dimensional evolution (CBACB_S) and multi-dimensional evolution (CBABC_M). According to the success and failure evolution experience, we first introduce a scaling factor based on cumulative binomial probability.

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a novel Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) framework that integrates Sugeno–Weber t-norm and t-conorm within the Complex q-Rung Picture Fuzzy Set (Cq-RPFS) paradigm. Our approach introduces three new aggregation operators: Sugeno–Weber Weighted Average, Sugeno–Weber Ordered Weighted Average, and Sugeno–Weber Hybrid Weighted Average under the environment of Cq-RPFS. These operators enhance fuzzy information aggregation by addressing complex criterion interrelationships, offering a more nuanced evaluation of emission reduction strategies. We validate our framework through a detailed case study on emissions in India, focusing on aligning reduction strategies with sustainable development goals. The proposed method demonstrates superior effectiveness in managing multidimensional data compared to traditional aggregation techniques. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis and comparative studies further reveal the robustness and adaptability of our approach, showcasing its potential to provide more accurate and balanced assessments in real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {We developed time and frequency domains neural network surrogate models of synthetic seismograms stemming from the resolution of the three-dimensional equation of motion. The surrogates predict the time or frequency-series knowing the input variables of the physical model. The surrogate models are used to quantify epistemic uncertainty in ground motion prediction through global sensitivity analysis. We first generate a dataset of time domain synthetic seismograms in a seven-dimensions uncertain space using the spectral-element method. To validate the surrogate model, we evaluate its ability to reproduce at least 80% of the bootstrap resamples. Additionally, the R 2 regression coefficient between the simulations generated by the spectral-element method code and those predicted by the neural network is 0.94 for the validation set, confirming the accuracy of the surrogate model. These surrogates allow fast predictions of velocity time-series or Fourier amplitude spectra where spectral-element simulations are not done (neural networks compute about 100,000 surrogates per second, while a single spectral-element simulation longs approximately 7 h on 48 cores). To quantify the uncertainty of the physical system under study, a global sensitivity analysis is undertaken to better understand how uncertain parameters affect the predicted state of the system. We present two sampling-based estimation methods, the so-called “pick-freeze” Sobol method and the Li and Mahadevan method, to quantify this uncertainty. The Sobol method requires approximately 500,000 simulations to achieve stability, whereas the Li and Mahadevan method requires only 30,000 simulations. Using the metamodel, both methods require only a few seconds to produce results, although the Li and Mahadevan method analyzes 10,000 simulations per second, compared to 3,000 for the Sobol method. The results indicate that the shear wave velocity in the physical system’s layer is the most influential parameter affecting the ground speed on the physical system. In contrast, at a reference station (without considering the geological properties of the physical system), the results show that the shear wave velocity in the first and third deep layers are the most influential parameters.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among the global working population. Automated and accurate grading of diabetic retinopathy is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases. However, challenges arise in grading due to class imbalance, inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and the small scale of lesions in different stages of diabetic retinopathy. To address the issues of class imbalance and small lesion scales, the dynamic momentum contrastive learning network (DMCLNet) for diabetic retinopathy grading is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new strategy is introduced for constructing positive and negative samples to enhance individual differences. Then, an encoder and a momentum encoder are used to extract features from the main image, the positive and negative samples, respectively. The dynamic balancing strategy is presented to update the multi-class feature queue and calculate the similarity matrix between the main image and each positive and negative sample for contrastive learning. A dual dimensional loss function guides the training of the proposed model to fully capture the subtle differences between images of different classes, which improves inter-class discrimination ability. Finally, channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms are applied to enhance disease-related fine-grained features and suppress irrelevant redundant information, which accurately identifies small-scale lesions and improves the precision of severity grading. Extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies on three public datasets demonstrate that DMCLNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. It can achieve superior diabetic retinopathy grading performance across multiple datasets without relying on pixel-level lesion annotation, with high accuracy and generalization.},

  abstract     = {Creating classification models to predict whether an optical channel can provide a required level of transmission quality is a promising approach to automated path quality assessment in optical network design. The applicability of machine learning algorithms in this domain is limited, however, by the cost, effort, and time needed to collect sufficient labeled data for model creation. The necessary amount of labeled data may be substantially reduced by active learning. This is an iterative process, creating a sequence of models, where each model is used to select the most useful paths for a class labeling query which are then added to the training set for the next model. Such a learning scenario poses different challenges for machine learning algorithms than standard “passive” learning, since they have to deal with very small and often imbalanced data. This work examines how these challenges are handled by algorithms that have been found particularly useful for optical path classification by prior studies. The random forest and extreme gradient boosting algorithms are applied to active learning from a real dataset provided by a network operator, starting only from a handful of training instances. Uncertainty sampling and diversity sampling are used for query selection. Confidence-based and stability-based stopping criteria are used to determine when the process can be safely terminated. The results confirm that active learning is a useful approach to creating optical path classification models, making it possible to save more than a half of the cost needed to provide class labels for model creation.},

In view of the above two reasons, we first establish two indicators in this paper, path centrality index and node importance index, and the proposed indicators accurately quantify the importance of paths and nodes in the water distribution network. The dynamic demand water distribution network vulnerability is assessed through the proposed two-index neural network algorithm. Firstly, a novel feedforward neural network is proposed to obtain path and flow information, and the neural network structure is established according to the topology of the water distribution network. Then, based on this information, the path centrality index and node importance index are calculated, and the important node and path sets are found. Finally, according to the dynamic demand of each user, the supply–demand ratio in the faulty network is solved. Theoretical analysis proves that the time complexity of the algorithm is o ( 6 n 2 ) . Administrators can further optimize maintenance schedules based on the supply–demand ratio over time. Taking the widely studied North Marin Water District Network in California as an example, it is proved that the proposed two-index neural network algorithm has increased accuracy, faster computation than static methods. However, the proposed algorithm relies on the complete network topology, and the uncertainty of the network topology can be further explored in future research.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, artificial intelligence has been applied to improve intelligent transportation systems, with a special focus on developing autonomous vehicles. Monocular depth estimation is a crucial task in autonomous driving, offering a cost-effective alternative to binocular methods. While existing approaches for this task leverage self-supervised learning of deep neural networks, they have not taken into account key requirements for their use in autonomous vehicles, such as the need to preserve the privacy of samples collected by multiple vehicles, reduce network consumption during training, and optimize the computation cost distribution. In recent studies, the use of federated learning has shown notable benefits when addressing these requirements. Thus, we propose a novel method combining federated learning and deep self-supervision to enable training of monocular depth estimators with comparable efficacy and superior efficiency to current methods. Our evaluation experiments, using two public benchmarks of images captured by moving vehicles, show that our proposed method achieves near state-of-the-art performance, with test losses of 0.115 and 0.169 on each dataset requiring, on average, only 1k to 1.25k training steps and about 65.1% to 87.4% less data transfer per vehicle in each round than our baseline.},

To capture the dynamic nature of incidents, the model learns from time series data on traffic flow, speed, and occupancy. Additionally, it employs a graph neural network architecture to model the spatial relationships between sensors, while also accounting for factors such as time and incident type. By training the model with cross-entropy loss, we enable it to predict whether an incident’s duration will be long or short. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Furthermore, we conduct a case study to visualize the impact of incidents and further validate the model’s predictive capability.},

Despite the considerable advancements achieved by convolutional neural networks, segmentation errors such as under-segmentation and mis-segmentation remain significant obstacles, particularly in complex medical images where target regions often share similar features with the background. In this paper, we propose a generalized network called Correction of Medical Image Segmentation Errors through Contrast Learning with Multi-Branch Network (MEC) to address these biases and ultimately improve segmentation accuracy. MEC leverages a multi-branch architecture, where each branch is specifically designed to tackle distinct segmentation issues. The negative branch focuses on encoding mis-segmented regions, the positive branch captures accurately labeled regions, and the anchor branch refines the segmentation output from the base network. To effectively integrate the complementary information from these branches, we employ a contrastive learning strategy that aligns the semantic features of the anchor branch with those of the positive branch, while maintaining a clear distinction from the negative branch. This methodology enhances segmentation performance by capitalizing on the unique strengths of each branch. Experimental results on several medical image datasets demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

This technique allows to explore a wide range of possible solutions using various combinations of α , β -cuts. Next, the multi-objective problem is converted into a weighted problem coupled with duality theory to remodel into a single-layer recurrent neural network.

With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence, generating high-quality CAM by combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformer architectures has received widespread attention. As a classic architecture, Conformer adopts a parallel structure and has been applied in multiple WSSS models. We observed that the attention matrices of different levels of Transformer blocks in Conformer exhibit significant characteristic differences, and these matrices effectively capture the correlations between different regions. Based on this observation, we propose a method called Attention-Guided Class Activation Map (AG-CAM), which selectively utilizes attention matrices at different levels to enhance features for various purposes. Detailed experiments on common datasets have shown that the proposed AG-CAM method significantly improves the quality of class activation maps.

  abstract     = {The growing threat of global warming has heightened the importance of accurately predicting carbon dioxide emissions, a key factor in climate change mitigation. Previous studies have developed carbon emission prediction models using aggregated yearbook statistics, which are limited by spatiotemporal constraints and data scarcity. These models often assume data stationarity, overlooking the dynamic nature of carbon dioxide emission, leading to less reliable predictions that fall short of informing effective urban emission reduction strategies. This paper presents a novel approach by introducing two first daily, city-specific, multi-source carbon dioxide emissions datasets. It integrates global carbon dioxide emissions grid data from CarbonMonitor-graced with concentration measurements from the global carbon column total observation network. To make better use of these data features, we introduce a novel deep learning model, the K oopman A ssistant F eature Net work (KAFNet). By incorporating carbon dioxide concentration and calendar features as additional inputs, we apply the Koopman Operator theory, which is adept at analyzing the time-varying dynamics of complex systems. This approach allows for a comprehensive consideration of the underlying dynamics within carbon emissions data, enabling end-to-end optimization of predictive targets. Our empirical analysis reveals that our model significantly outperforms the sub-optimal models it was compared against, with an average reduction of 34.5% in Mean Absolute Error and 18.8% in Mean Squared Error. This enhancement in predictive accuracy provides a robust tool for capturing the evolving trends in carbon dioxide emissions, thereby offering a solid quantitative foundation to support data-driven decision-making in urban carbon reduction policies.},
