  abstract     = {This study introduces significant improvements in the construction of deep convolutional neural network models for classifying agricultural products, specifically oranges, based on their shape, size, and color. Utilizing the MobileNetV2 architecture, this research leverages its efficiency and lightweight nature, making it suitable for mobile and embedded applications. Key techniques such as depthwise separable convolutions, linear bottlenecks, and inverted residuals help reduce the number of parameters and computational load while maintaining high performance in feature extraction. Additionally, the study employs comprehensive data augmentation methods, including horizontal and vertical flips, grayscale transformations, hue adjustments, brightness adjustments, and noise addition to enhance the model&#39;s robustness and generalization capabilities. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.53%∼100% with nearly perfect precision, recall of 95.7%, and F1-score of 94.6% for both “orange_good” and “orange_bad” classes, significantly outperforming previous models which typically achieved accuracies between 70% and 90%. While the classification performance was near-perfect in some aspects, there were minor errors in specific detection tasks. The confusion matrix shows that the model has high sensitivity and specificity, with very few misclassifications. Finally, this study highlights the practical applicability of the proposed model, particularly its easy deployment on resource-constrained devices and its effectiveness in agricultural product quality control processes. These findings affirm the model in this research as a reliable and highly efficient tool for agricultural product classification, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models in this field.},

  abstract     = {The Gaussian Q-function (GQF) is widely used in various scientific and engineering fields, especially in telecommunications and wireless communication. However, the lack of a closed-form expression for this function has led to considerable research efforts to achieve more accurate approximations. This study introduces a new approximate method that provides high accuracy for the boundaries of the GQF. The proposed approach utilizes parametric functions for both the lower and upper bounds of the GQF. The parameters of these functions are estimated using the Wild Horse Optimization (WHO), a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, with the aim of minimizing the distance between the proposed functions and the actual GQF. The optimization process targets the minimization of the maximum absolute error and the mean absolute error, ensuring that the proposed bounds provide a tight and accurate approximation of the GQF. Numerical experiments and comparisons with existing bounds demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method. The new lower and upper bounds achieve significantly lower maximum absolute error and mean absolute error values compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in estimating the symbol error probability (SEP) for various digital modulation schemes, showing that the new bounds provide more accurate estimates of the SEP compared to the existing bounds. The results highlight the practical significance of the proposed method in enhancing the reliability of error probability estimation in communication systems.},

  abstract     = {The no-wait job shop scheduling problem (NWJSP) plays a crucial role in industrial production and is an NP-hard problem. We propose a hybrid discrete artificial bee colony (HDABC) algorithm for solving the NWJSP with the total tardiness criterion. In the proposed algorithm, we first design multiple discrete operations which combine with the basic framework of the artificial bee colony algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a new selection method that allows onlooker bee to select better food sources. To determine the start times of the jobs, we introduce and adapt the left timetabling method for the tardiness objective under consideration. Experimental results show that the HDABC algorithm has better search capability than two well-performing ABC algorithms as well as an iterated greedy algorithm in solving the NWJSP with the total tardiness criterion.},

Also, we assess the quality of the new approximation using two criteria namely the maximum absolute error and the mean absolute error. The approximation is expressed in closed form and it produces a maximum absolute error of 4.43 × 10 − 10 , while the mean absolute error is 9.62 × 10 − 11 . In addition, we propose an approximation of the inverse cumulative function of the standard normal distribution based on Polya approximation and compare the accuracy of our findings with some of the existing approximations. The results show that our approximations surpass other the existing ones based on the aforementioned accuracy measures.},
