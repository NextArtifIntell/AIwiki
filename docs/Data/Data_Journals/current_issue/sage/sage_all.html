  abstract     = {The collective homeostasis model, grounded in ecological dynamics, has recently been proposed to explain the self-regulating individual-environment interactions that are necessary to conceptualizing sports teams as collective homeostatic systems. Based on these insights and given the capacity of humans to construct and adapt their ecological niches, this article explores the creation of enriching sporting contexts for the development of adaptive player-environment interactions in competitive team sports. This model of adaptation emphasizes the importance of creating a sports niche rich in shared affordances to enable team coordination through the development of individual and collective homeostasis in different sub-phases of competitive performance. In a homeostatic sports system, principles of play advocated by coaches allow players to intentionally coordinate and adapt their actions to shape the collective identity of the team. The team’s identity is shaped by the synergetic development of collective attractors (stable system states) emerging at specific scales of complexity. This is facilitated through the manipulation of constraints by the coaching and support staff. These ideas have important implications for implementing team sports training and performance preparation, helping to transform the self-regulating tendencies of players through adapting their behaviors to dynamic performance contexts.},

  abstract     = {The ability of robots to make efficient and effective behavior decisions is a critical prerequisite for completing various tasks in unknown and complex environments. When operating in continuously changing environments, robots often struggle to achieve satisfactory decision-making outcomes due to a lack of prior knowledge about the environment. Investigating how to endow robots with human-like learning and decision-making capabilities to make sound decisions in changing environments remains a significant topic in robotics research. This paper models the processes of memory replay and memory consolidation by mimicking the memory conversion mechanism of the human brain, from the cellular level (synaptic consolidation) and system level (system consolidation), and proposes a human-like brain memory consolidation model based on a motivated developmental network. By leveraging different neurotransmitters’ neuromodulatory effects and considering the dependency of memory conversion on the neocortex during the memory transformation process, the model simulates the conversion of short-term memory to long-term memory and the reconsolidation of long-term memory, enhancing memory plasticity and improving the robot’s learning and decision-making capabilities in dynamic environments. Physical experiments and comparative tests have verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Multistable perception, characterized by spontaneous alternations between perceptual states, has garnered increasing attention in autism research, because atypical performance in multistable perception tasks has been suggested as a behavioral marker of this population. However, previous studies in this field have yielded variable and conflicting results leading to inconsistent conclusions. Here we present a computational model integrating key neurocognitive mechanisms, all of which have been considered critical in accounting for atypical behavior in autism, such as bottom-up/top-down processes, the excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance, and neural noise. By systematically altering these mechanisms within an artificial neural network, we explored their functional roles on perceptual fluctuations. Our approach provides a clearer understanding of how specific behaviors may correlate with varied neural and cognitive alterations in autism. This model offers a perspective on key debates in autism research, such as the direction for the excitation/inhibition imbalance, and the possible dominance of bottom-up processing. Moreover, this model challenges heuristic single-mechanism theories of autism, favoring neurodiversity approaches by illustrating the spectrum’s complexity, where identical behaviors might result from diverse neurocognitive mechanisms. We highlight the need for future research to employ multiple behavioral tasks to map neurocognitive alterations in autism, aiming for more precise identification and management in therapeutic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In an article from 2023, Tom Froese suggests Irruption Theory as a new conceptual framework for understanding the causal efficacy of normative states, particularly concerning motivations for action in embodied agents. Froese’s theory is built on three central tenets, two of which—the Irruption and Scalability theses—are central to its claim that normative states causally affect behavior via the creation and amplification of the microscopic, stochastic processes after which the theory is named. According to Froese, this amplification process explains why agential behavior is underdetermined by its material basis, creating a causal gap that can be filled by causally-efficacious normative states. In this commentary, I argue that the Irruption and Scalability theses do not give a sufficiently detailed account of how underdetermination arises in material systems and how the scaling-up of irruptions causally affects normative behavior. However, the theses should not be rejected outright. Rather, I argue that Irruption Theory should adopt central concepts from complex systems theory in order to adequately describe the causal efficacy of normativity in embodied agents. To this end, I suggest that it should identify normative states as relations holding between embodied agents and similar-scale systems in their environment. These relations can be usefully described and modeled as topologies of a large-scale agent-environment system that top-down constrain an agent’s behavior. Accordingly, I propose interpreting irruptions as a boundary condition for normative behavior, with normative states as one of its control parameters (237 words).},

  abstract     = {The spinal diseases commonly faced by people in the 19th century included intervertebral disc degeneration, tuberculosis and congenital defects that resulted in neurological impairment and global disability. To address these issues, cervical spine surgery was performed. Modern techniques currently used in spine surgery include interbody devices, pedicle screws, artificial discs and bone grafts. The postoperative complications clinically reported during follow-up include nonunion and implant subsidence, which remain significant drawbacks. The objective of this study is to develop a 3-dimensional finite element model of the C2-C7 cervical spine and validate it against existing experimental studies. The loading conditions considered for this study include a compressive preload of 50 N and a 1 Nm moment applied to the C2 vertebra, with the C7 vertebra fixed at the bottom. In this study, the biomechanical alterations of 4 different cage morphologies were analysed using finite element analysis. Valeo cages with 4 distinct designs were implanted at the C5-C6 level, and physiological motion at the surgical site was studied. Cage subsidence and migration, which can lead to adjacent segment disc degeneration, were also examined. Subsidence was primarily attributed to higher stress encountered in the cage, so stress distribution within the cages was evaluated. Additionally, stress distribution in the anterior plate and screws was analysed. The study concludes that introducing anterior plate and screw fixation helps prevent cage subsidence. Physiological motion at the surgical level was reduced compared to the intact model. Adjacent disc stress was also evaluated and found to be lower than in the intact model.},

  abstract     = {We report on the development of an implementable physics-data hybrid dynamic model for an articulated manipulator to plan and operate in various scenarios. Meanwhile, the physics-based and data-driven based dynamic models are studied in this research to select the best model for planning. The physics-based model is constructed using the Lagrangian method, and the loss terms include inertia loss, viscous loss, and friction loss. As for the data-driven model, three methods are explored, including deep neural network, long short-term memory, and XGBoost. Our modeling results demonstrate that, after comprehensive hyperparameter optimization, the XGBoost architecture outperforms deep neural network and long short-term memory in accurately representing manipulator dynamics. With approximately 500k training data points, the XGBoost model closely matches the performance of the physics-based model, as assessed by the root mean square error between actual and estimated manipulator torque. The hybrid model with physics-based and data-driven terms has the best performance among all models based on the same root mean square error criteria, and it only needs about 24k of training data. In addition, we developed a virtual force sensor of a manipulator using the observed external torque derived from the dynamic model and designed a motion planner through the physics-data hybrid dynamic model. The external torque contributes to forces and torque on the end effector, facilitating interaction with the surroundings, while the internal torque governs manipulator motion dynamics and compensates for internal losses. By estimating external torque via the difference between measured joint torque and internal losses, we implement a sensorless control strategy which demonstrated through a peg-in-hole task. Lastly, a learning-based motion planner based on the hybrid dynamic model assists in planning time-efficient trajectories for the manipulator. This comprehensive approach underscores the efficacy of integrating physics-based and data-driven models for advanced manipulator control and planning in industrial environments.},

Consequently, the storage and communication security of abnormal transaction data pose significant challenges within the architecture and communication framework of the smart grid. To address these issues, this paper proposes a security protection scheme for abnormal transaction data in smart grid system. By employing a private blockchain network composed of consensus nodes, the scheme ensures the integrity and availability of abnormal transaction data. Additionally, the proposed authentication protocol facilitates secure communication among smart meters, consensus nodes, and servers within the blockchain-based smart grid system.

  abstract     = {In clinical practice, prostate particle implantation surgery is performed by a robot control puncture needle; it is a safe and effective treatment method for prostate cancer. During surgery, the tissue deformation is caused by interaction forces between the needle and soft tissue, which results in the displacement error between the needle tip and the target point in the axial direction, thus affecting the precision of particle implantation and treatment effect. Therefore, an axial compensation precision puncture control method for prostate puncture robot is proposed in this article. Firstly, the position action relationship between the puncture needle and the target point is analyzed in the needle’s entry into the tissue, and the force analysis is carried out by the biomechanical Kelvin model; the interaction model between the puncture needle and the soft tissue is established, so as to obtain the axial compensation precision puncture control model. Then, an improved adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on Levy Flight is proposed to identify parameters of this control model for puncture prostate in this article. Matlab–Adams co-simulation mode is used to simulate and analyze the axial compensation precision puncture control method when the puncture needle enters soft tissue, and thus the optimal parameters of this control model for puncture prostate are obtained. Finally, the experiment of puncture velocity with the axial compensation and comprehensive experiment of axial compensation puncture control method are carried out in combination with the robot. The results of the puncture velocity verification experiment show that when the puncture velocity is 12.3 mm/s, the parameters values (elastic coefficient of 2.165 N/m and damping coefficient of 0.754 Ns/m) obtained by identification are reasonable. In the experimental analysis for parameters identification, bionic soft tissue and pig kidney are used for experimental identification, and the results are basically consistent with the simulation. In the comparison experiment of axial compensation positioning performance, the coincidence degree between the tip of the puncture needle and the designated position reached 80% (higher than 35% of direct puncture). Meanwhile, in the comparison experiment of different puncture depths, the axial puncture deviation is 0.54–0.62 mm when the puncture depth is 50–80 mm, which is significantly smaller than the direct puncture of 1.58–2.15 mm. The experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the axial compensation precision puncture control method proposed in this article and the identification of parameter values, which can better improve the puncture accuracy and ensure the treatment effect of particle implantation for prostate cancer. The contents of this article can provide reference for the research of minimally invasive puncture surgery.},

  abstract     = {The ability of robots to detailed navigate and map environments is crucial for many industrial tasks. Traditional robotic control methods, using frameworks like ROS2 (Robot Operating System) combined with tools like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and NAV2 (Navigation 2), often require specialized programming knowledge, limiting accessibility for non-expert users. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), could offer a promising alternative, enabling robots to be controlled through natural language commands. These LLM-driven systems have the potential to simplify robot interaction by translating high-level language prompts into detailed movement, mapping, and exploration tasks. There is a lack of existing solutions for utilizing natural language commands in certain movement and trajectory tasks, particularly in exploration scenarios. Current approaches are not equipped to effectively translate contextual references (e.g. next to the corner, between doors, towards the nearest unexplored area, etc.) into concrete robot commands. This proposal integrates LLMs with ROS2, SLAM, and NAV2, allowing users to issue natural language commands for detailed navigation, path planning, and mapping tasks including unexplored areas. By reducing the technical barrier to robot control, our system enables more intuitive and flexible human–robot interaction in complex environments, making robotic systems accessible to a broader range of users. In the explored scenarios, the proposed approach successfully transforms most of the users’ textual prompts into a set of robot commands, achieving an F1-score of 0.913 for the successful transformation of entire prompts (composed of multiple sub-prompts) and an F1-score of 0.975 for individual commands.},

  abstract     = {Locking state recognition is one of the key tasks of railway freight monitoring. However, accurate localization and recognition of small locking mechanisms remain major challenges. Current approaches that focus on existing object recognition methods lead to high false detection and miss rates. This paper introduces TrainNet for efficient locking state detection for Open-top wagon doors. A dataset was collected using a robot with a camera to validate our method. We designed an efficient layer aggregation network (ELAN)-S module in our TrainNet, which can be used with YOLOv7. The module efficiently extracts curvilinear features and is integrated into the backbone feature extraction network to enhance the feature representation capability. An LSKCSPC module is also introduced to capture a dynamic receptive field, enabling TrainNet to adjust its receptive field dynamically to the scale of the object, improving its feature representation capacity. Furthermore, the detection head for small-scale objects is redesigned, the feature layer size is increased to enhance the ability to extract and detect fine-grained features. Finally, the loss function is modified to a dynamic fusion-based CNIOU, which reduces the sensitivity of original loss to small objects and improves performance. Experimental results show that the algorithm achieves a mean average precision (mAP50) of 91.5%, which is a 3.6% improvement over the baseline YOLOv7 algorithm. The model weight file size of new algorithm is 60.2MB with 19.5% reduction compared to the baseline. The proposed method achieves 91.5% for detecting the lock status of railway freight open-top wagon side doors, while reducing the complexity of the original algorithm and achieving a real-time detection speed of 39.8fps, meeting the requirements for practical application. The algorithm also exhibits good robustness as demonstrated by experiments on the WiderPerson dataset.},

Aiming at the motion planning problem involved in the decision-making layer of autonomous valet parking, this article proposes a trajectory planning method that obtains global time optimization by solving the optimization problem. The method is based on the path points obtained by the improved hybrid A-star algorithm as the reference waypoints. The global trajectory planning problem is segmented. In each section, the physical system constraints of the vehicle, the boundary condition constraints, and obstacle avoidance constraints in the parking process are comprehensively considered, and the parking trajectory planning task is described as an optimal control problem. The optimal problem is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem by the numerical optimization method. Finally, the global optimal trajectory is obtained on the basis of ensuring the continuity of state variables and control variables. Simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the algorithm for horizontal and vertical parking. The real vehicle test shows that the vehicle can be safely, quickly, and accurately parked in the parking space.},

This approach utilizes the contact-implicit differential dynamic programming (DDP) framework, merging the hard contact model with a linear complementarity constraint. We propose the analytical gradient of the contact impulse based on relaxed complementarity constraints to further the exploration of a variety of contact modes. By leveraging a hard contact model-based simulation and computation of search direction through a smooth gradient, our methodology identifies dynamically feasible state trajectories, control inputs, and contact forces while simultaneously unveiling new contact mode sequences. However, the broadened scope of contact modes does not always ensure real-world applicability. Recognizing this, we implemented differentiable cost terms to guide foot trajectories and make gait patterns. Furthermore, to address the challenge of unstable initial roll-outs in an MPC setting, we employ the multiple shooting variant of DDP. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world demonstrations using a 45 kg HOUND quadruped robot, performing various tasks in simulation and showcasing actual experiments involving a forward trot and a front-leg rearing motion.},

In this paper, we unify the concept of transfer learning in robotics and provide the first taxonomy of its kind considering the key concepts of robot, task, and environment. Through a review of the promises and challenges in the field, we identify the need of transferring at different abstraction levels, the need of quantifying the transfer gap and the quality of transfer, as well as the dangers of negative transfer.

  abstract = {Bats exhibit a remarkable ability to create periodic air jets, manifested as pulsating wake structures downstream of their flight path, as they navigate through their fluidic environment. This distinctive skill, driven by their fine-grained and dynamic wing motions, is integral to bats’ unparalleled agility and flight efficiency. We refer to flight led by these dynamic wing adjustments as “ dynamic morphing wing flight.” The robotic emulation of bats’ adept manipulation of their fluidic surroundings offers fresh perspectives for aerial robotics. Nevertheless, the design of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) following the bat’s style presents significant challenges, including constraints related to payload, actuation, and computation. While contemporary MAVs primarily consider body structures as mere hosts for components, our work explores a morphology-centric MAV design that aims to incorporate closed-loop motion control within the structural design itself, termed “computational structures.” To fulfill this objective, we have developed Aerobat, an MAV equipped with dynamic morphing wings, onboard electronics, including actuators, an inertial measurement unit, an onboard camera, and a powerful computer. In the design of Aerobat, we meticulously addressed two specific needs: (1) the generation of gaits using a limited number of high-power actuators, and (2) the regulation of gaits employing an arbitrary number of low-power actuators. Our contributions in this work encompass (1) the introduction of a morphology optimization-based design framework, (2) the demonstration of stable, untethered dynamic morphing flights, and (3) achieving an aerodynamic force enhancement mechanism through wing surface maximization and wing rise-up time minimization.},

  abstract = {Learning-based adaptive control methods hold the potential to empower autonomous agents in mitigating the impact of process variations with minimal human intervention. However, their application to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been constrained by two main challenges: (1) the presence of unknown dynamics in the form of sea current disturbances, which cannot be modelled or measured due to limited sensor capability, particularly on smaller low-cost AUVs, and (2) the nonlinearity of AUV tasks, where the controller response at certain operating points must be excessively conservative to meet specifications at other points. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a solution to these challenges by training versatile neural network policies. Nevertheless, the application of DRL algorithms to AUVs has been predominantly limited to simulated environments due to their inherent high sample complexity and the distribution shift problem. This paper introduces a novel approach by combining the Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning framework with a classic model-based control architecture to formulate an adaptive controller. In this framework, we propose a Sim-to-Real transfer strategy, incorporating a bio-inspired experience replay mechanism, an enhanced domain randomisation technique, and an evaluation protocol executed on a physical platform. Our experimental assessments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in learning proficient policies from suboptimal simulated models of the AUV. When transferred to a real-world vehicle, the approach exhibits a control performance three times higher compared to its model-based nonadaptive but optimal counterpart.},

Recently, Koopman operator theory has been shown capable of constructing control-oriented soft robot models from data. However, building these models requires extensive data collection and they do not necessarily generalize well outside of the training observations. This paper presents a more data-efficient and generalizable approach to soft robot modeling that first identifies a physics-based Koopman model then supplements it with a data-driven residual Koopman model. The resulting combined model is linear and thus compatible with real-time model-based control techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated on several simulated systems and on a real soft robot arm, where it is shown to generate models that are more accurate than purely physics-based models and require less data to construct than purely data-driven models. Using a model-based controller, the soft arm is able to successfully track end effector trajectories, perform a pick-and-place task, and write on a dry-erase board, showcasing the applicability of this framework to increase the capabilities of soft robotic systems.},

Some such relaxations exist in the literature for specific problem setups that assume the matrix von Mises-Fisher distribution (a.k.a., matrix Langevin distribution or chordal distance) for isotropic rotational uncertainty. However, another common way to represent uncertainty for rotations and poses is to define anisotropic noise in the associated Lie algebra. Starting from a noise model based on the Cayley map, we define our estimation problems, convert them to Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (QCQPs), then relax them to Semidefinite Programs (SDPs), which can be solved using standard interior-point optimization methods; global optimality follows from Lagrangian strong duality. We first show how to carry out basic rotation and pose averaging. We then turn to the more complex problem of trajectory estimation, which involves many pose variables with both individual and inter-pose measurements (or motion priors). Our contribution is to formulate SDP relaxations for all these problems based on the Cayley map (including the identification of redundant constraints) and to show them working in practical settings. We hope our results can add to the catalogue of useful estimation problems whose solutions can be a posteriori guaranteed to be globally optimal.},

Benchmark datasets enable the widespread development of state-of-the-art machine learning methods, which require large datasets for training, validation, and thorough comparison to competing approaches. Underwater environments impose several operational challenges that hinder efforts to collect large benchmark datasets for marine robot perception. Furthermore, a low abundance of targets of interest relative to the size of the search space leads to increased time and cost required to collect useful datasets for a specific task. As a result, there is limited availability of labeled benchmark datasets for underwater applications. We present the AI4Shipwrecks dataset, which consists of 28 distinct shipwrecks totaling 286 high-resolution labeled side scan sonar images to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous sonar image understanding. We leverage the unique abundance of targets in Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in Lake Huron, MI, to collect and compile a sonar imagery benchmark dataset through surveys with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We consulted with expert marine archaeologists for the labeling of robotically gathered data. We then leverage this dataset to perform benchmark experiments for comparison of state-of-the-art supervised segmentation methods, and we present insights on opportunities and open challenges for the field. The dataset and benchmarking tools will be released as an open-source benchmark dataset to spur innovation in machine learning for Great Lakes and ocean exploration.

Utilizing the MobileNetV2 architecture, this research leverages its efficiency and lightweight nature, making it suitable for mobile and embedded applications. Key techniques such as depthwise separable convolutions, linear bottlenecks, and inverted residuals help reduce the number of parameters and computational load while maintaining high performance in feature extraction. Additionally, the study employs comprehensive data augmentation methods, including horizontal and vertical flips, grayscale transformations, hue adjustments, brightness adjustments, and noise addition to enhance the model&#39;s robustness and generalization capabilities. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.53%∼100% with nearly perfect precision, recall of 95.7%, and F1-score of 94.6% for both “orange_good” and “orange_bad” classes, significantly outperforming previous models which typically achieved accuracies between 70% and 90%. While the classification performance was near-perfect in some aspects, there were minor errors in specific detection tasks. The confusion matrix shows that the model has high sensitivity and specificity, with very few misclassifications. Finally, this study highlights the practical applicability of the proposed model, particularly its easy deployment on resource-constrained devices and its effectiveness in agricultural product quality control processes. These findings affirm the model in this research as a reliable and highly efficient tool for agricultural product classification, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models in this field.},

  abstract     = {The Gaussian Q-function (GQF) is widely used in various scientific and engineering fields, especially in telecommunications and wireless communication. However, the lack of a closed-form expression for this function has led to considerable research efforts to achieve more accurate approximations. This study introduces a new approximate method that provides high accuracy for the boundaries of the GQF. The proposed approach utilizes parametric functions for both the lower and upper bounds of the GQF. The parameters of these functions are estimated using the Wild Horse Optimization (WHO), a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, with the aim of minimizing the distance between the proposed functions and the actual GQF. The optimization process targets the minimization of the maximum absolute error and the mean absolute error, ensuring that the proposed bounds provide a tight and accurate approximation of the GQF. Numerical experiments and comparisons with existing bounds demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method. The new lower and upper bounds achieve significantly lower maximum absolute error and mean absolute error values compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in estimating the symbol error probability (SEP) for various digital modulation schemes, showing that the new bounds provide more accurate estimates of the SEP compared to the existing bounds.

  abstract     = {The no-wait job shop scheduling problem (NWJSP) plays a crucial role in industrial production and is an NP-hard problem. We propose a hybrid discrete artificial bee colony (HDABC) algorithm for solving the NWJSP with the total tardiness criterion. In the proposed algorithm, we first design multiple discrete operations which combine with the basic framework of the artificial bee colony algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a new selection method that allows onlooker bee to select better food sources. To determine the start times of the jobs, we introduce and adapt the left timetabling method for the tardiness objective under consideration. Experimental results show that the HDABC algorithm has better search capability than two well-performing ABC algorithms as well as an iterated greedy algorithm in solving the NWJSP with the total tardiness criterion.},

Also, we assess the quality of the new approximation using two criteria namely the maximum absolute error and the mean absolute error. The approximation is expressed in closed form and it produces a maximum absolute error of 4.43 × 10 − 10 , while the mean absolute error is 9.62 × 10 − 11 . In addition, we propose an approximation of the inverse cumulative function of the standard normal distribution based on Polya approximation and compare the accuracy of our findings with some of the existing approximations. The results show that our approximations surpass other the existing ones based on the aforementioned accuracy measures.},

We examine data for the companies in the 2020 and 2022 Fortune Global 500 and find that corporate definitions of diversity are dynamic and vary across regions. Furthermore, while supplier diversity efforts are not yet widespread, these initiatives are increasingly common, especially in the form of references to diversity in companies’ supplier codes of conduct. Companies in North America and in certain economic sectors, such as the financial and healthcare sectors, are more likely to have such efforts in place. Based on our data, companies that report on their internal diversity and companies that have other forms of supplier sustainability initiatives are also more likely to have supplier diversity initiatives. We argue further that supplier diversity efforts will follow a trajectory similar to other supplier sustainability efforts. Finally, we suggest possible avenues for future research on supplier diversity.},

Using a novel measure of workplace EEO based on the textual analysis of online job postings, we show a lead–lag pattern of EEO practice between principal customers and their dependent suppliers. The leadlag effect is more pronounced when principal customers enjoy greater bargaining power, consistent with the view that dependent suppliers adjust EEO policies to cater to customer preferences. We use the 2017 Diversity Campaign of the “Big Three” institutional investors as our main identification strategy to support a causal interpretation. We demonstrate that the diffusion of EEO policies along supply chains improves the likelihood of retaining female employees, implying the presence of social benefits in addition to economic advantages.},

  abstract     = {Entrepreneurial activity is widely seen as an important tool for addressing the racial wealth gap. However, the survival of minority-owned businesses depends on their ability to win contracts from buyer firms—which might be impacted by buyers’ racial biases. Whether discrimination can exist in sourcing and affect this ability is an unexplored question, perhaps due to an implicit assumption that business-to-business settings are immune from discriminatory biases. In this paper, we use controlled experiments to study whether racial discrimination can affect sourcing decisions. We find that when a supplier&#39;s sales manager has a distinctively Black name, buyers are 6.5% less likely (statistically significant at 1% level) to select that supplier compared to a supplier with a sales manager with a distinctively white name. Our findings suggest that equal-opportunity legislation similar to that already in place in the labor market may be needed in the sourcing context. Our findings have implications for executives, suggesting that supplier diversity programs and procurement-bias training can boost corporate performance by expanding the supplier pool, and simultaneously enhance a firm&#39;s corporate social responsibility profile.},

Through interviews with representatives of minority- and majority-owned businesses, we uncover the difficulties that minority-owned businesses face in accessing LPOs. They receive fewer development opportunities and are less upwardly mobile than their majority-owned counterparts. Trust emerged as a critical factor required for minority-owned businesses to gain access to LPOs. We explore additional factors that may influence LPO procurement decisions beyond racial biases, such as the dense networks of minority-owned businesses, the risks associated with engaging minority-owned businesses, and the complexity of LPO organizational structures.

  abstract     = {Despite formal supplier diversity initiatives and lofty goals, corporate spending with diverse suppliers is about 7%. Conversely, the U.S. federal government&#39;s spending with these suppliers exceeds 25%. The government&#39;s use of set-asides, which limit the bidding on certain contracts to small or small and diverse suppliers, is one reason that might explain this difference. Although set-asides entail socioeconomic benefits for these suppliers, they are controversial. Our study contributes to this debate by investigating the types of federal procurement contracts typically awarded to small and diverse suppliers and whether set-asides help these suppliers win more complex contracts. We also examine contractual performance in terms of cost overruns and delays for contracts performed by small and diverse suppliers versus other suppliers and contracts awarded to small and diverse suppliers through set-asides versus no set-asides. We test these effects by analyzing 38,417 procurement contracts awarded by all U.S. federal departments and independent agencies between 2011 and 2022. Our results show that small and diverse suppliers are more likely to be selected for less complex contracts. Set-asides, however, have a boosting effect, increasing the likelihood that these suppliers are selected even for more complex contracts. Moreover, contracts performed by small and diverse suppliers exhibit (a) similar cost overruns and delays as contracts performed by other suppliers and (b) lower cost overruns and shorter delays when awarded through set-asides rather than without set-asides. Our results have implications for the sourcing literature, small and diverse suppliers, and procurement professionals.},

One specific call to action from stakeholders is the public disclosure of intersectional diversity data in EEO-1s, which companies with 100+ employees must report each year to the federal government, but which companies rarely make publicly available. Conducting five online experiments to examine how consumers perceive transparency into an operation’s workforce diversity, we find no evidence that disclosing workforce diversity data undermines customer attitudes or behaviors toward the company, even when the disclosures reveal racial disparities across job categories. Instead, we find that consumers perceive firms that disclose their workforce diversity data to be more committed to DEI initiatives, view disclosing firms more positively, and are more likely to choose their offerings over those of non-disclosing firms. We find these attitudinal and behavioral differences to be especially pronounced when the disclosures reveal progress in diversification.},

  abstract     = {Amidst stakeholder demands for transparency and the recent pandemic, the inner workings of supply chains have become more visible. This visibility has shone a spotlight on workplace corporate social irresponsibility (CSI)—actions within a company&#39;s internal supply chain operations perceived to harm the well-being of its employees. At the same time, companies scrambling to recruit new talent for operations and supply chain management (OM/SCM) face dual challenges in the shortage of diverse talent and the emergence of new generations in the workforce. Research indicates that younger generations and women more broadly expect social responsibility from their employers, but it is unclear how they perceive social irresponsibility when evaluating job offers. To begin to address this gap, we draw on attribution theory and develop hypotheses that examine prospective employees’ responses to workplace CSI in supply chain operations and whether their responses vary with gender and pay. Results from a conjoint task and mixed effects models reveal that both young men and young women respond negatively to job offers from firms with pervasive workplace CSI across their supply chain operations and atypical levels of workplace CSI relative to other firms. Although we do not find gender differences in general, supplementary analyses offer more nuanced insights (e.g., young men respond less favorably than young women when workplace CSI is pervasive, whereas young women respond more favorably than young men to above-average pay). Overall, our study advances understanding of the spillover effects of workplace CSI on new talent recruitment and highlights that the new generation&#39;s preferences run deeper than traditional gender-based expectations. In doing so, we offer timely guidance for executives and human resource managers as companies struggle to recruit diverse new OM/SCM talent.},

  abstract     = {Excellent service is often discussed with an assumption of equivalency in its application, yet the reality is far more complex. Customers have distinct needs that pose distinct challenges for frontline service employees. In hotel settings, providing excellent service to a diverse set of guests is more nuanced when frontline employees themselves are from a wide variety of backgrounds. Whereas the literature considers operational tactics to promote excellence in guest service, it is unclear whether training, policies and procedures, and leadership designed to advance excellence have the same impact on employees who, by virtue of their background, are more attuned to guests’ needs. We extend the literature by empirically demonstrating that operational tactics impact frontline employees’ perceptions of service equality, with racial/ethnic minority employees seeing statistically distinct impacts. Employing a sample of 25,698 employee-year observations across 32 luxury hotels in the United States over 3 years, we find that codified policies and procedures, as well as training, improve assessments of guest service equality. In contrast, racial/ethnic minority employees are less impacted than their White counterparts by leadership stances that seem to promote equality more broadly. After controlling for time and other relevant employee- and hotel-level variables, operational tactics (a) improve perceptions of service equality, and (b) reduce the disparity between White and racial/ethnic-minority service-quality assessments. Our findings provide further direction for managers to elevate such perceptions of customer service equality across the board by leveraging training and by reinforcing clear operating policies and procedures.},

In this study, we report on two laboratory experiments that induce routines to assess the stability of coordination and adaptability to organizational changes across mixed-gender teams of varying diversity and empirically examine operational performance via routines. Based on frequentist and Bayesian statistical approaches, our findings reveal that compared to other mixed-gender teams, balanced-gender teams (a) attain stability in routines faster, (b) exhibit varying levels of adaptability to internal and external changes, and (c) deliver better economic benefits via resource- and time-efficiencies under normal and change conditions, and this is attributable to their higher pace of routine formation. We find the operational-performance effect more prominent in situations of change than in normal conditions. Alongside our theoretical contributions, our study has several implications for management and effective operations management in terms of team composition, hiring, and staffing decisions.},

  abstract     = {Research suggests that workgroup diversity influences various group and organizational-level outcomes. However, few studies consider its impact at the individual level, particularly in knowledge-related work, where workers have considerable discretion in making decisions. Our study aims to fill this gap by examining two significant types of workgroup diversity—gender diversity, a kind of bio-demographic diversity, and specialization diversity, a kind of job-related diversity—in a healthcare setting. Using detailed data on the entire patient population of Florida hospitals (10.14 million patients), including 25,187 physicians across 240 hospitals over a period of 4 years, we find that physicians who work in departments with more diverse colleagues (in terms of gender and specialization) have better patient outcomes, for example, a shorter stay, lower cost of treatment and increased likelihood of discharge to home. We find that the impacts of colleague diversity are contingent on departmental focus. Our research shows that specialization diversity, a type of job-related and deep-level difference, especially helps physicians who work in more specialization-diverse departments perform better when their departments are less focused. In contrast, we find that physicians in more gender-diverse departments perform even better when in more focused departments. Our results are robust to alternate explanations and biases arising from patient selection, population demographics, and endogeneity in diversity measures. Our study adds to a relatively small literature in operations management that considers how workgroup diversity (beyond diversity in on-the-job experience) might influence individual performance. Our research also contributes to the emerging conversation on why hiring managers should actively work toward improving workplace diversity.},

  abstract     = {Language system diversity is a source of individual differences. Research on human cognition has established that writing direction influences non-linguistic mental schemata such as spatial orientation. However, there is little empirical evidence of its impact on task performance. We examine whether task performance in manual order-picking is higher when the in-aisle travel direction follows the writing direction of order pickers. We conducted this study in cooperation with a German brick-and-mortar grocery retailer, allowing us to employ a unique real-world data set comprising 3,200,534 storage-location visits by 113 order pickers, 61 of whom had a left-to-right and 52 a right-to-left writing direction. Our statistical analyses suggest that order-picking task performance improves when the in-aisle travel direction follows individual writing direction. This creates a path to diversity-inspired operations management that treats efficiency and the diversity and inclusion of human workers as equally important for optimization.},

  abstract     = {Despite an increasing emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), there is a noticeable gap in empirical research concerning its implications, particularly within the manufacturing sector. In response, we scrutinize the impact of DEI commitment on publicly traded manufacturing corporations through the lens of signaling theory. We employ an event study methodology and use structural topic modeling to analyze 233 DEI-commitment announcements issued by 161 firms over a 10-year period between 2013 and 2022. Our findings suggest that DEI-commitment announcements can yield positive abnormal stock returns during the announcement period (from day −1 to 0 and from day −1 to 5). The impact is heightened when the announcement places a stronger emphasis on DEI than non-DEI topics and when it focuses on specific DEI-related subjects, which are referred to here as signal strength and signal specificity. We also discuss the managerial implications of our findings.},

  abstract     = {How we manage operations—the domain of Operations Management (OM)—has important implications for the practice of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in organizations. Conversely, DEI goals have important implications for organizations’ OM practices. We outline the two-way links between DEI and OM to offer future research opportunities. In particular, we examine interactions between OM and DEI across four broad themes: (1) Workforce, (2) Supply Chains, (3) Health and Society, and (4) Technology, Platforms, and Innovation. We conclude with a discussion of DEI in OM as it relates to research and teaching. This article is a collaborative effort with the Senior Editors involved in the special issue of Production and Operations Management on “DEI in Operations and Supply Chain Management.”},
