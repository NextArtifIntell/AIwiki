  abstract     = {The collective homeostasis model, grounded in ecological dynamics, has recently been proposed to explain the self-regulating individual-environment interactions that are necessary to conceptualizing sports teams as collective homeostatic systems. Based on these insights and given the capacity of humans to construct and adapt their ecological niches, this article explores the creation of enriching sporting contexts for the development of adaptive player-environment interactions in competitive team sports. This model of adaptation emphasizes the importance of creating a sports niche rich in shared affordances to enable team coordination through the development of individual and collective homeostasis in different sub-phases of competitive performance. In a homeostatic sports system, principles of play advocated by coaches allow players to intentionally coordinate and adapt their actions to shape the collective identity of the team. The team’s identity is shaped by the synergetic development of collective attractors (stable system states) emerging at specific scales of complexity. This is facilitated through the manipulation of constraints by the coaching and support staff. These ideas have important implications for implementing team sports training and performance preparation, helping to transform the self-regulating tendencies of players through adapting their behaviors to dynamic performance contexts.},

  abstract     = {The ability of robots to make efficient and effective behavior decisions is a critical prerequisite for completing various tasks in unknown and complex environments. When operating in continuously changing environments, robots often struggle to achieve satisfactory decision-making outcomes due to a lack of prior knowledge about the environment. Investigating how to endow robots with human-like learning and decision-making capabilities to make sound decisions in changing environments remains a significant topic in robotics research. This paper models the processes of memory replay and memory consolidation by mimicking the memory conversion mechanism of the human brain, from the cellular level (synaptic consolidation) and system level (system consolidation), and proposes a human-like brain memory consolidation model based on a motivated developmental network. By leveraging different neurotransmitters’ neuromodulatory effects and considering the dependency of memory conversion on the neocortex during the memory transformation process, the model simulates the conversion of short-term memory to long-term memory and the reconsolidation of long-term memory, enhancing memory plasticity and improving the robot’s learning and decision-making capabilities in dynamic environments. Physical experiments and comparative tests have verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Multistable perception, characterized by spontaneous alternations between perceptual states, has garnered increasing attention in autism research, because atypical performance in multistable perception tasks has been suggested as a behavioral marker of this population. However, previous studies in this field have yielded variable and conflicting results leading to inconsistent conclusions. Here we present a computational model integrating key neurocognitive mechanisms, all of which have been considered critical in accounting for atypical behavior in autism, such as bottom-up/top-down processes, the excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance, and neural noise. By systematically altering these mechanisms within an artificial neural network, we explored their functional roles on perceptual fluctuations. Our approach provides a clearer understanding of how specific behaviors may correlate with varied neural and cognitive alterations in autism. This model offers a perspective on key debates in autism research, such as the direction for the excitation/inhibition imbalance, and the possible dominance of bottom-up processing. Moreover, this model challenges heuristic single-mechanism theories of autism, favoring neurodiversity approaches by illustrating the spectrum’s complexity, where identical behaviors might result from diverse neurocognitive mechanisms. We highlight the need for future research to employ multiple behavioral tasks to map neurocognitive alterations in autism, aiming for more precise identification and management in therapeutic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In an article from 2023, Tom Froese suggests Irruption Theory as a new conceptual framework for understanding the causal efficacy of normative states, particularly concerning motivations for action in embodied agents. Froese’s theory is built on three central tenets, two of which—the Irruption and Scalability theses—are central to its claim that normative states causally affect behavior via the creation and amplification of the microscopic, stochastic processes after which the theory is named. According to Froese, this amplification process explains why agential behavior is underdetermined by its material basis, creating a causal gap that can be filled by causally-efficacious normative states. In this commentary, I argue that the Irruption and Scalability theses do not give a sufficiently detailed account of how underdetermination arises in material systems and how the scaling-up of irruptions causally affects normative behavior. However, the theses should not be rejected outright. Rather, I argue that Irruption Theory should adopt central concepts from complex systems theory in order to adequately describe the causal efficacy of normativity in embodied agents. To this end, I suggest that it should identify normative states as relations holding between embodied agents and similar-scale systems in their environment. These relations can be usefully described and modeled as topologies of a large-scale agent-environment system that top-down constrain an agent’s behavior. Accordingly, I propose interpreting irruptions as a boundary condition for normative behavior, with normative states as one of its control parameters (237 words).},

  abstract     = {Over the past two decades, researchers have thoroughly investigated cooperation within social dilemmas to address societal challenges. However, there has been limited interdisciplinary review of this field. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of 2,232 articles from 2003 to 2023 within this research domain, utilizing CiteSpace. Our analysis includes statistical, collaboration, co-citation, and keyword co-occurrence analyses to elucidate current trends, key contributors, themes, and emerging areas. The findings indicate that: (1) The publications have shown a rising trend, meaning cooperation topics in social dilemmas receive wide attention. (2) Cooperation in social dilemmas is a prominent and interdisciplinary topic characterized by strong collaboration among regions, authors, and journals. (3) Key topics include social value orientation, spatial public goods games, procedural fairness, and group cooperation. Additionally, emerging research trends may encompass evolutionary dynamics of cooperation, complex networks of social dilemmas, sex differences in cooperation, and climate change. (4) Future research should focus on interdisciplinary theoretical integration, the brain mechanisms of cooperation, emerging social dilemmas in the real world, and cross-cultural comparative studies. This study provides a reference for researchers to understand the theme and research hotspot of cooperation within social dilemmas.},
