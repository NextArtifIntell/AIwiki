  abstract     = {Regression to the mean is said to have occurred when subjects having relatively high or low measurements are remeasured closer to the population mean. This phenomenon can influence the conclusion about the effectiveness of a treatment in a pre-post study design. The mean difference of the pre- and post-variables, conditioned on the initial variable being above or below a cut-point, is the sum of regression to the mean and treatment effects. Expressions for regression to the mean are available for the bivariate normal distribution under restrictive assumptions, and for the bivariate Poisson and binomial distributions, more generally. This article derives expressions for regression to the mean for any bivariate distribution while making fewer restrictive assumptions than previous methods. Maximum likelihood estimators are derived, and the unbiasedness, consistency, and asymptotic normality of these estimators are shown for exponential families, where possible. Data on the cholesterol levels in men aged 35-39 are used for decomposing the conditional mean difference in cholesterol level on pre-post occasions into regression to the mean and treatment effects. In another example, data on diastolic blood pressure for 341 patients are used to demonstrate the fraction of change due to regression to the mean and the treatment effects, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Laboratories use group (pooled) testing with multiplex assays to reduce the time and cost associated with screening large populations for infectious diseases. Multiplex assays test for multiple diseases simultaneously, and combining their use with group testing can lead to highly efficient screening protocols. However, these benefits come at the expense of a more complex data structure which can hinder surveillance efforts. To overcome this challenge, we develop a general Bayesian framework to estimate a mixed multivariate probit model with data arising from any group testing protocol that uses multiplex assays. In the formulation of this model, we account for the correlation between true disease statuses and heterogeneity across population subgroups, and we provide for automated variable selection through the adoption of spike and slab priors. To perform model fitting, we develop an attractive posterior sampling algorithm which is straightforward to implement. We illustrate our methodology through numerical studies and analyze chlamydia and gonorrhea group testing data collected by the State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa.},

  abstract     = {The joint analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data is vital in brain research, revealing complex interactions between brain structures and functions. Our study is motivated by the analysis of a vast dataset of brain functional connectivity (FC) and multimodal structural imaging (SI) features from the UK Biobank. Specifically, we aim to investigate the effects of SI features, such as white matter microstructure integrity (WMMI) and cortical thickness, on the whole-brain functional connectome network. This analysis is inherently challenging due to the extensive structural-functional associations and the intricate network patterns present in multimodal high-dimensional neuroimaging data. To bridge methodological gaps, we developed a novel multi-level sub-graph extraction method (dense bipartite with nested unipartite graph) within a matrix(network)-on-vector regression model. This method identifies subsets of spatially specific SI features that intensely and systematically influence FC sub-networks, while effectively suppressing false positives in large-scale datasets. Applying our method to a multimodal neuroimaging dataset of 4242 participants ffrom the UK Biobank, we evaluated the effects of whole-brain WMMI and cortical thickness on resting-state FC. Our findings indicate that the WMMI in corticospinal tracts and inferior cerebellar peduncle significantly affect functional connections of sensorimotor, salience, and executive sub-networks, with an average correlation of 0.81 ( ⁠|$p &lt; 0.001$|⁠ ).},

  abstract     = {An important aspect of precision medicine is the tailoring of treatments to specific patient types. Nowadays, various methods are available to estimate for this purpose so-called optimal treatment regimes, that is, decision rules for treatment assignment that map patterns of pretreatment characteristics to treatment alternatives and that maximize the expected patient benefit. However, the application of these methods to real-life data has been limited and comes with nonstandard statistical issues. In search of best practices, we reanalyzed data from a randomized clinical trial for the treatment of dysthymic disorder. While the original objective of this trial was to detect a marginally best treatment alternative, we wanted to estimate an optimal treatment regime using 2 prominent estimation methods: Q-learning and value search estimation. An important obstacle in the dataset under study was the occurrence of missing values. This was handled with multiple imputation, a thoughtful implementation of which, however, implied several challenges. Other challenges were implied by the concrete implementation of value search estimation. In this paper, all the choices we have made in the analysis to handle the aforementioned issues are detailed together with a motivation and a description of possible alternatives. Accordingly, this paper may serve as a guide to apply optimal treatment regime estimation in data-analytic practice.},

  abstract     = {A common practice for establishing the reliability of a new computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) device is to evaluate how well its clinical measurements agree with those of a gold standard test. However, in many clinical studies, a gold standard is unavailable, and one needs to aggregate information from multiple imperfect reference standards for evaluation. A key challenge here is the heterogeneity in diagnostic accuracy across different reference standards, which may lead to biased evaluation of a device if improperly accounted for during the aggregation process. We propose an intuitive and easy-to-use statistical framework for evaluation of a device by assessing agreement between its measurements and the weighted sum of measurements from multiple imperfect reference standards, where weights representing relative reliability of each reference standard are determined by a model-free, unsupervised inductive procedure. Specifically, the inductive procedure recursively assigns higher weights to reference standards whose assessments are more consistent with each other and form a majority opinion, while assigning lower weights to those with greater discrepancies. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not require any modeling assumptions or external data to quantify heterogeneous accuracy levels of reference standards. It only requires specifying an appropriate agreement index used for weight assignment and device evaluation. The framework is applied to evaluate a CAD device for kidney obstruction by comparing its diagnostic ratings with those of multiple nuclear medicine physicians.},

This endeavor is substantially challenged when the intermediate variable is continuously scaled and there are infinitely many basic principal strata. We employ a Bayesian nonparametric approach to flexibly evaluate treatment effects across flexibly modeled principal strata. The approach uses Bayesian Causal Forests (BCF) to simultaneously specify 2 Bayesian Additive Regression Tree models; one for the principal stratum membership and one for the outcome, conditional on principal strata. We show how the capability of BCF for capturing treatment effect heterogeneity is particularly relevant for assessing how treatment effects vary across the surface defined by continuously scaled principal strata, in addition to other benefits relating to targeted selection and regularization-induced confounding. The capabilities of the proposed approach are illustrated with a simulation study, and the methodology is deployed to investigate how causal effects of power plant emissions control technologies on ambient particulate pollution vary as a function of the technologies’ impact on sulfur dioxide emissions.},

Unlike many proposals that simply vectorize the matrix-valued connectivity predictors, thereby ignoring their geometric structure, the method presented here respects the Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices by using a tangent space modeling. Dimension reduction is performed in the tangent space, relating the resulting low-dimensional representations to the responses. The dimension reduction matrix is learned in a supervised manner with a sparsity-inducing prior imposed on a Stiefel manifold to prevent overfitting. Our method yields a parsimonious regression model that allows uncertainty quantification of all model parameters and identification of key brain regions that predict the outcomes. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in simulation settings and through a case study to predict Picture Vocabulary scores using data from the Human Connectome Project.},

Identifying PASC and its subphenotypes is challenging because available data are “negative-unlabeled” as uninfected individuals must be PASC negative, but those with prior infection have unknown PASC status. Moreover, feature selection among many potentially informative characteristics can facilitate reaching a concise and easily interpretable PASC definition. Therefore, to characterize PASC and the spectrum of PASC subphenotypes while identifying a minimal set of features, we propose a Bernoulli mixture model with novel parameterization to accommodate negative-unlabeled data and Bayesian priors to induce sparsity. We present an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm for estimation, and a grid search procedure to select the number of clusters and level of sparsity.

  abstract     = {Group sequential designs (GSDs), which involve preplanned interim analyses that allow for early stopping for efficacy or futility, are commonly used for ethical and efficiency reasons. Covariate adjustment, which involves appropriately adjusting for prespecified prognostic baseline variables, can improve precision and is generally recommended by regulators. Combining these, that is, using adjusted estimators at interim and final analyses of a GSD, has potential for dual benefits. We address 2 challenges involved in combining these methods. First, adjusted estimators may lack the independent increments structure (asymptotically) that is required to directly apply standard stopping boundaries for GSDs. We address this by applying a linear transformation to the sequence of adjusted estimators across analysis times, resulting in a new sequence of consistent, asymptotically normal estimators with the independent increments property that either improves or leaves precision unchanged. This approach generalizes foundational results on GSDs with semiparametric efficient estimators to any sequence of regular, asymptotically linear estimators. Second, we address the practical problem of handling uncertainty about how much (if any) precision gain will result from covariate adjustment. This is important for trial planning, since an incorrect projection of a covariate’s prognostic value risks an over- or underpowered trial. We propose using information-adaptive designs, that is, continuing the trial until the required information level is achieved. This design enables faster, more efficient trials, without sacrificing validity or power.},

Our non-parametric modeling of the response curves relies on radial basis function-nets with shared hidden neurons. Our model thus facilitates modeling commonality among the treatment outcomes. The estimation and inference schemes are developed under a Bayesian framework using thresholded best linear projections and implemented via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, appropriately accommodating uncertainty in all aspects of the analysis. The numerical performance of the method is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

  abstract     = {In longitudinal data analyses, the within-individual repeated measurements often exhibit large variations and these variations appear to change over time. Understanding the nature of the within-individual systematic and random variations allows us to conduct more efficient statistical inferences. Motivated by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral dynamic studies, we considered a nonlinear mixed effects model for modeling the longitudinal means, together with a model for the within-individual variances which also allows us to address outliers in the repeated measurements. Statistical inference was then based on a joint model for the mean and variance, implemented by a computationally efficient approximate method. Extensive simulations evaluated the proposed method. We found that the proposed method produces more efficient estimates than the corresponding method without modeling the variances. Moreover, the proposed method provides robust inference against outliers. The proposed method was applied to a recent HIV-related dataset, with interesting new findings.},

  abstract     = {Covariance is an important measure of marginal dependence among variables. However, heterogeneity in subject covariances and regression models for high-dimensional covariance matrices is not well studied. Compared to regression analysis for conditional means, modeling high-dimensional covariances is much more challenging due to the large set of free parameters and the intrinsic positive-definite property that puts constraints on the regression parameters. In this paper, we propose a regularized estimation method for the regression coefficients of covariances under sufficient and necessary constraints for the positive definiteness of the conditional average covariance matrices given covariates. The proposed estimator satisfies the sparsity and positive-definite properties simultaneously. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to solve the constrained and regularized optimization problem. We show the convergence of the proposed ADMM algorithm and derive the convergence rates of the proposed estimators for the regression coefficients and the heterogeneous covariances. The proposed method is evaluated by simulation studies, and its practical application is demonstrated by a case study on brain connectivity.},

  abstract     = {An interpretable model or method has several appealing features, such as reliability to adversarial examples, transparency of decision-making, and communication facilitator. However, interpretability is a subjective concept, and even its definition can be diverse. The same model may be deemed as interpretable by a study team, but regarded as a black-box algorithm by another squad. Simplicity, accuracy and generalizability are some additional important aspects of evaluating interpretability. In this work, we present a general, flexible and harmonious framework to construct interpretable functions in regression analysis with a focus on continuous outcomes. We formulate a functional skeleton in light of users’ expectations of interpretability. A new measure based on Mallows’s |$C_p$| -statistic is proposed for model selection to balance approximation, generalizability, and interpretability. We apply this approach to derive a sample size formula in adaptive clinical trial designs to demonstrate the general workflow, and to explain operating characteristics in a Bayesian Go/No-Go paradigm to show the potential advantages of using meaningful intermediate variables. Generalization to categorical outcomes is illustrated in an example of hypothesis testing based on Fisher’s exact test. A real data analysis of NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) is conducted to investigate relationships between some important laboratory measurements. We also discuss some extensions of this method.},

  abstract     = {In cluster randomized experiments, individuals are often recruited after the cluster treatment assignment, and data are typically only available for the recruited sample. Post-randomization recruitment can lead to selection bias, inducing systematic differences between the overall and the recruited populations and between the recruited intervention and control arms. In this setting, we define causal estimands for the overall and the recruited populations. We prove, under the assumption of ignorable recruitment, that the average treatment effect on the recruited population can be consistently estimated from the recruited sample using inverse probability weighting. Generally, we cannot identify the average treatment effect on the overall population. Nonetheless, we show, via a principal stratification formulation, that one can use weighting of the recruited sample to identify treatment effects on two meaningful subpopulations of the overall population: Individuals who would be recruited into the study regardless of the assignment, and individuals who would be recruited into the study under treatment but not under control. We develop an estimation strategy and a sensitivity analysis approach for checking the ignorable recruitment assumption, which we implement in the publicly available CRTrecruit R package. The proposed methods are applied to the ARTEMIS cluster randomized trial, where removing co-payment barriers increases the persistence of P2Y 12 inhibitor among the always-recruited population.},
