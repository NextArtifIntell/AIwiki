Our approach has uncertainty on a set of multivariate random variables dependent on the allocation decision. In our main result and contribution, we characterize the acceptance set, penalty term, and necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality. Moreover, we provide concrete examples for uncertainty sets, especially based on closed balls under -norms and Wasserstein distance. We also expose examples that relate our approach to the alternative where uncertainty is treated in a univariate setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with finite-dimensional models for the entire term structure for energy futures. As soon as a finite-dimensional set of possible yield curves is chosen, one likes to estimate the dynamic behavior of the yield curve evolution from data. The estimated model should be free of arbitrage which is known to result in some drift condition. If the yield curve evolution is modelled by a diffusion, then this leaves the diffusion coefficient open for estimation. From a practical perspective, this requires that the chosen set of possible yield curves is compatible with any obtained diffusion coefficient. In this paper, we show that this compatibility enforces an affine geometry of the set of possible yield curves.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study a reinsurance Stackelberg game in which both the insurer and the reinsurer adopt the mean-variance criterion in their decision-making and the reinsurance is irreversible. We apply a unified singular control framework where irreversible reinsurance contracts can be signed in both discrete and continuous times. The results theoretically illustrate that, rather than continuous-time contracts or a bunch of discrete-time contracts, a single once-for-all reinsurance contract is preferred. Moreover, the Stackelberg game turns out to be centering on the signing time of the single contract. The insurer signs the contract if the premium rate is lower than a time-dependent threshold and the reinsurer designs a premium that triggers the signing of the contract at his preferred time. Further, we find that reinsurance preference, discount, and reversion have a decreasing dominance in the reinsurer’s decision-making, which is not seen for the insurer.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a general framework for modeling the dynamics of limit order books, built on the combination of two modeling ingredients: the order flow, modeled as a general spatial point process, and market clearing, modeled via a deterministic “mass transport” operator acting on the distributions of buy and sell orders. At the mathematical level, this leads to a natural decomposition of the infinitesimal generator describing the evolution of the limit order book into two operators: the generator of the order flow and a clearing operator. This decomposition provides a flexible and modular framework for modeling and simulating order book dynamics and studying various scaling limits of discrete order book models. We show that our framework includes previous models as special cases and yields insights into the interplay between order flow and price dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Time inconsistency (TIC) often arises in multiperiod decision-making through the encoding of more realistic human preferences as objectives; TIC describes a situation in which a plan, consisting of current and future actions, that is optimal today may no longer be optimal in the future. The subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) solution is well-known to resolve such TIC, backed by evidence from behavioral economics and stochastic control literature. Motivated by TIC proliferation and SPE desirability in handling TIC, this paper establishes a subgame perfect equilibrium reinforcement learning (SPERL) framework to search for an SPE solution for TIC problems. We propose a new class of algorithms, called extended backward policy iteration (EBPI), that solves SPERL and concurrently addresses two algorithmic challenges in TIC-RL: the nonexistence of natural recursive relationships between value functions at different time points and the questionable applicability of standard policy iteration algorithms due to unprovable policy improvement theorems. To demonstrate the practical usage of EBPI as a training framework, we adopt standard RL sample-based methods and derive two EBPI-based training algorithms. We examine our derived training frameworks on a mean-variance portfolio selection problem and evaluate some performance metrics including convergence and model identifiability.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work we consider the exponential utility maximization problem in the framework of semistatic hedging. In addition to the usual setting considered in mathematical finance, we also consider an investor who is informed about the risky asset’s price changes with a delay. When the stock increments are independent, identically distributed, and follow a normal distribution, we compute explicitly the value of the problem and the corresponding optimal hedging strategy in a discrete- and a continuous-time setting. In discrete time, our approach is based on duality theory and tools from linear algebra which are related to banded matrices and Toeplitz matrices. Next, we study an analogous continuous-time model where it is possible to trade at fixed equally spaced times. In this model, we compute the scaling limit for both the trading strategy and the achieved value as the frequency of the trading events increases. Finally, we prove that this scaling limit coincides with the continuous-time hedging problem.},
