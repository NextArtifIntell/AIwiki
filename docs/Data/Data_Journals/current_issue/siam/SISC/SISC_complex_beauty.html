As a result, the regularization term is both dependent on and adaptive to the observed data and noise. We demonstrate that is a regularization method and rigorously establish both its convergence and stability properties. We present selected numerical experiments in two-dimensional computed tomography, wherein we integrate the method with various reconstruction techniques , including filtered back projection (graphLa+FBP), standard Tikhonov (graphLa+Tik), total variation (graphLa+TV), and a trained deep neural network (graphLa+Net). The approach significantly enhances the quality of the approximated solutions for each method .

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider in this work an inverse acoustic scattering problem when only phaseless total field data is available. The inverse problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed due to the lack of phase information. Solving inverse scattering problems with phaseless data is important in applications as the collection of accurate phased data is usually difficult and expensive. A novel direct sampling method (DSM) will be developed to effectively estimate the locations and shapes of the unknown scatterers from phaseless data generated by a very limited number of incident waves. With a careful theoretical analysis of the behavior of the index function and some representative numerical examples, the new DSM is shown to be computationally efficient, easy to implement, and robust to large noise, and it does not require any prior knowledge of the unknown scatterers. Furthermore, to fully exploit the index functions obtained from the DSM, we further combine the DSM with a deep learning technique (DSM-DL) to achieve high-quality reconstructions. Several challenging and representative numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of reconstructions by DSM-DL. The DSM-DL networks trained by phased data are further theoretically and numerically shown to be able to solve problems with phaseless data. Additionally, our numerical experiments also show the DSM-DL can solve inverse scattering problems with mixed types of scatterers, which renders its applications in many important practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we consider a deep learning approach to the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem. It is well known that traditional deep learning relies solely on data, which may limit its performance for the inverse problem when only indirect observation data and a physical model are available. A fundamental question arises in light of these limitations: is it possible to enable deep learning to work on inverse problems without labeled data and to be aware of what it is learning? This work proposes a deep decomposition method (DDM) for such purposes, which does not require ground truth labels. It accomplishes this by providing physical operators associated with the scattering model to the neural network architecture. Additionally, a deep learning based data completion scheme is implemented in DDM to prevent distorting the solution of the inverse problem for limited aperture data. Furthermore, apart from addressing the ill-posedness imposed by the inverse problem itself, DDM is the first physics-aware machine learning technique that has the interpretability property for obstacle detection. The convergence result of DDM is theoretically investigated. We also prove that adding small noise to the input limited aperture data can introduce additional regularization terms and effectively improve the smoothness of the learned inverse operator. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed DDM even when the incident and observation apertures are extremely limited.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are widely used in scientific computing to tackle high-dimensional systems. However, traditional ROM methods may only partially capture the intrinsic geometric characteristics of the data. These characteristics encompass the underlying structure, relationships, and essential features crucial for accurate modeling. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel ROM framework that integrates optimal transport (OT) theory and neural network–based methods. Specifically, we investigate the kernel proper orthogonal decomposition method exploiting the Wasserstein distance as the custom kernel, and we efficiently train the resulting neural network employing the Sinkhorn algorithm. By leveraging an OT-based nonlinear reduction, the presented framework can capture the geometric structure of the data, which is crucial for accurate learning of the reduced solution manifold. When compared with traditional metrics such as mean squared error or cross-entropy, exploiting the Sinkhorn divergence as the loss function enhances stability during training, robustness against overfitting and noise, and accelerates convergence. To showcase the approach’s effectiveness, we conduct experiments on a set of challenging test cases exhibiting a slow decay of the Kolmogorov n-width. The results show that our framework outperforms traditional ROM methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Urban wind flow simulation, based on numerical methods, serves as a powerful tool for understanding the intricate interactions between urban structures and atmospheric conditions. The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) stands out as a popular choice for simulating urban wind flow. However, traditional LBM approaches face limitations in terms of scalability on large parallel computing systems and their ability to support high-resolution wind flow simulations across vast megacities spanning hundreds of square kilometers. In response to these challenges, we introduce THLB (Tianhe lattice Boltzmann), a purpose-built LBM simulator tailored for large-scale urban wind flow simulations. THLB streamlines the preprocessing of extensive simulation data through an innovative scheme that automatically identifies flow regions along irregular boundaries. Additionally, THLB integrates a novel processing pipeline and employs parallel optimization techniques, enhancing scalability and performance for large-scale LBM simulations. Our assessment of THLB involves conducting wind flow simulations within a megacity covering an area of at an impressive one-meter simulation resolution, featuring 150,000 buildings. This simulation represents the most extensive urban wind flow analysis to date, comprising over two trillion simulation lattices. We gauge THLB’s performance on the Tianhe new-generation supercomputer, harnessing more than 155 million heterogeneous cores. Our experimental results demonstrate exceptional performance and scalability, achieving a peak computation throughput of 24,553.43 G Lattices Updates Per Second (GLUPS), setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for LBM simulations. Despite the inherent challenges of large-scale LBM simulations, our approach showcases robust scalability, delivering 90.48% and 69.91% of weak and strong scaling efficiency, respectively.},

Low-rank approximations are widely used to reduce the memory footprint and operational complexity of numerous linear algebra algorithms in scientific computing and data analysis. In some of our recent work we have demonstrated that low-rank approximations can be stored using multiple arithmetic precisions to further reduce the storage and execution time. In this work we present a method that can produce this mixed-precision representation directly; this relies on a mixed-precision truncated rank-revealing QR factorization with pivoting. We present a floating-point error analysis and provide bounds on the error of the approximation demonstrating that the use of multiple precisions does not alter the overall accuracy. Finally, we present experimental results showing the execution time reduction for the cases where either classical or randomized pivoting are used. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modern accelerators use hierarchical parallel programming models that enable massive multithreading within a processing element (PE), with multiple PEs per device driven by traditional processes. Batching is a technique for exposing PE-level parallelism in algorithms that have traditionally run on MPI processes or multiple threads within a single process. Opportunities for batching arise in, for example, kinetic discretizations of magnetized plasmas where collisions are advanced in velocity space at each spatial point independently. This paper builds on previous work on a high-performance, fully nonlinear, Landau collision operator by batching the linear solver, as well as batching the spatial point problems and adding new support for multiple grids for multiscale, multispecies problems. An anisotropic relaxation verification test that agrees well with previously published results and analytical models is presented. The performance results from NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI250X nodes are presented with hardware utilization analysis for each architecture. The entire implicit Landau operator time advance is implemented in Kokkos for performance portability, running entirely on the device and is available in the PETSc numerical library.

We use a substructured optimized nonoverlapping Schwarz domain decomposition method as a solver in order to significantly reduce the memory footprint required by such problems. To accelerate the convergence of the iterative solver we develop suitable transmission conditions based on local approximations of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, taking into account convection by strongly nonuniform mean flows. The development relies on the construction of absorbing boundary conditions through microlocal analysis and pseudodifferential calculus. We analyze the potential of the method in academic settings and subsequently propose a robust domain decomposition methodology for problems of industrial relevance modeled by the Pierce linearized acoustic operator. The algorithm is implemented in an open-source high-order finite element library. It allows solving challenging three-dimensional problems with more than one billion high-order unknowns, by taking full advantage of modern computer architectures.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modeling and simulation of multiphase flows in complex geometries are challenging due to the complexity in describing the interface topology changes among different phases and the difficulty in implementing the boundary conditions on the irregular solid surface. In this work, we first developed a diffuse-domain based phase-field model for multiphase flows in complex geometries. In this model, the irregular fluid region is embedded into a larger and regular domain by introducing a smooth characteristic function. Then, the reduction-consistent and conservative phase-field equation for the multiphase field and the consistent and conservative Navier–Stokes equations for the flow field are reformulated as the diffuse-domain based consistent and conservative (DD-CC) equations where some additional source terms are added to reflect the effects of boundary conditions. In this case, there is no need to directly treat the complex boundary conditions on the irregular solid surface, and additionally, based on a matched asymptotic analysis, it is also shown that the DD-CC equations can converge to the original governing equations as the interface width parameter tends to zero. Furthermore, to solve the DD-CC equations, we proposed a novel and simple lattice Boltzmann (LB) method with a Hermite-moment-based collision matrix which can not only keep consistent and conservation properties, but also improve the numerical stability with a flexible parameter. With the help of the direct Taylor expansion, the macroscopic DD-CC equations can be recovered correctly from the present LB method. Finally, to test the capacity of the LB method, several benchmarks and complex problems are considered, and the numerical results show that the present LB method is accurate and efficient for the multiphase flows in complex geometries.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Patient-specific brain mesh generation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be a time-consuming task and require manual corrections, e.g., meshing the ventricular system or defining subdomains. To address this issue, we consider an image registration approach. The idea is to use the registration of an input MR image to a respective target in order to obtain a new mesh from a template mesh. To obtain the transformation, we solve an optimization problem that is constrained by a linear hyperbolic transport equation. We use a higher order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for discretization and motivate the numerical upwind scheme and its limitations from the continuous weak space–time formulation of the transport equation. We present a numerical implementation that builds on the finite element packages FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, numerical results for the registration of an input to a target MRI of two distinct individuals are presented. Moreover, it is shown that the registration transforms a manually crafted input mesh into a new mesh for the target subject while preserving mesh quality. Challenges of the algorithm are discussed.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method that simultaneously evolves cell averages and point values at cell interfaces. Within the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based point value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation issue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind direction, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from decoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two issues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax–Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. In addition, a shock sensor–based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well. Several challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step and high Mach number jets.},

An extension procedure, which is essential for a narrow band level set method, is introduced based on a finite element - or -projection combined with the ghost penalty method. This procedure is formulated as a linear variational problem in a narrow band around the surface, making it computationally efficient and suitable for rigorous error analysis. The extension method is combined with a discontinuous Galerkin space discretization and a backward difference formula time-stepping scheme. The paper analyzes the stability and accuracy of the extension procedure and evaluates the performance of the resulting narrow band finite element method for the level set equation through numerical experiments.},

To achieve effective speed-up, the choice of the coarse propagator in the algorithm is vital. In this work, we investigate the use of optimized coarse propagators. Building upon the error estimation framework, we present a systematic procedure for constructing coarse propagators that enjoy desirable stability and consistent order. Additionally, we provide preliminary mathematical guarantees for the resulting parareal algorithm. Numerical experiments on a variety of settings, e.g., the linear diffusion model, the Allen–Cahn model, and the viscous Burgers model, show that the optimizing procedure can significantly improve parallel efficiency when compared with the more ad hoc choice of some conventional and widely used coarse propagators.

The intrinsic degenerate mobility in the equation yields a globally bounded solution. A pivotal feature of our methodology is an appropriate reformulation of the equation into an equivalent form. After applying a discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization method, we derive a fully nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a splitting structure. By introducing a linear term into the ODE, an exponential temporal discretization method, which involves only linear solvers, is proposed based on integrating factors and strong stability preserving Runge–Kutta methods. Our approach is proven to exhibit second-order accuracy, ensures bound preservation and mass conservation, and demonstrates a favorable CFL condition , where and are the temporal and spatial mesh sizes, respectively.

In this paper, we show how stencil composition can be applied to form finite difference stencils in order to numerically solve partial differential equations (PDEs). We present various properties of stencil composition and investigate the relationship between the order of accuracy of the composed stencil and that of the composing stencils. We also present comparisons between the stability restrictions of composed higher-order PDEs to their compact versions and numerical experiments wherein we verify the order of accuracy by convergence tests. To demonstrate an application to PDEs, a boundary value problem involving the two-dimensional biharmonic equation is numerically solved using stencil composition and the order of accuracy is verified by performing a convergence test. The method is then applied to the Cahn–Hilliard phase-field model. In addition to sample results in two and three dimensions for this benchmark problem, the stability, spectral properties, and sparsity are explored.},

The sPOD approximates transport-dominated flows by a sum of co-moving data fields. The proposed methods are derived from sPOD but optimize the co-moving fields directly and penalize their nuclear norm to promote a low rank of the individual data in the decomposition. A robustness term is added for handling interpolation errors and data noise. Using convex optimization tools, we derive three proximal algorithms to solve the decomposition problem. We report a numerical comparison with existing methods using synthetic data and then show the separation ability of our methods for incompressible and reactive flows. The resulting methodology is the basis of a new analysis paradigm that provides the same interpretability as POD for the individual co-moving fields.},

We show that the high-dimensional Markov operator can be obtained under a functional hierarchical tensor (FHT) ansatz with a hierarchical sketching algorithm. When the terminal condition admits an FHT ansatz, the proposed operator outputs an FHT ansatz for the PDE solution through an efficient functional tensor network contraction procedure. In addition, the proposed operator-based approach also provides an efficient way to solve the Kolmogorov forward equation when the initial distribution is in an FHT ansatz.
