  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper focuses on the homogenization of high-contrast dielectric elastomer composites, which are materials that deform in response to electrical stimulation. The considered heterogeneous material, consisting of an ambient material with inserted particles, is described by a weakly coupled system of an electrostatic equation with an elastic equation enriched with electrostriction. It is assumed that particles gradually become rigid as the fine-scale parameter approaches zero. This study demonstrates that the effective response of this system entails a homogeneous dielectric elastomer, described by a system of PDEs whose equations are fully decoupled. The coefficients of the homogenized equations depend on various factors, including the geometry of the composite, the periodicity of the original microstructure, and the coefficients characterizing the initial heterogeneous material. In particular, these coefficients are significantly influenced by the high-contrast nature of the coefficients of the fine-scale problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a new model reduction technique for multiscale scalar transport problems that exhibit dominant axial dynamics. Toward this aim, we rely on the separation of variables to combine a hierarchical model (HiMod) reduction with a two-scale asymptotic expansion. We extend the two-scale asymptotic expansion to an arbitrary order and exploit the high-order correctors to define the HiMod modal basis which approximates the transverse dynamics of the flow, while we adopt a finite element discretization to model the leading stream. The resulting method, which is named HiPhom (high-order projection-based homogenization), is successfully assessed both in steady and unsteady advection-diffusion-reaction settings. The numerical results confirm the very good performance of HiPhom, which improves the accuracy and the convergence rate of HiMod and extends the reliability of the standard homogenized solution to transient and preasymptotic regimes.},

The derived moment closure systems are well defined for all physically relevant moments, and the resultant approximations of the distribution function converge as the number of moments goes to infinity. The convergence makes our method stand out from most existing moment methods. Moreover, we devise a delicate moment inversion algorithm. As an application, the Vicsek model is studied for overdamped active particles, and the Poisson-EQMOM is validated with a series of numerical tests including spatially homogeneous, one-dimensional, and two-dimensional problems.},

This paper studies the physical observables of continuum Schrödinger operators for incommensurate systems. We characterize the density of states and local density of states in real and reciprocal spaces, and develop novel numerical methods to approximate them. In particular, we (i) justify the thermodynamic limit of the density of states and local density of states via the operator kernel characterization; and (ii) propose efficient numerical schemes based on plane wave approximation and the trapezoidal rule in reciprocal space.

Anal., 238 (2020), pp. 1413–1474], we show that total entropy can be decomposed into atomic site contributions and rigorously estimate the locality of site entropy. This analysis suggests that vibrational entropy can be effectively predicted using a surrogate model for site entropy. We employ machine learning to develop such a surrogate models employing the atomic cluster expansion model. We supplement our rigorous analysis with an empirical convergence study. In addition we demonstrate the performance of our method for predicting vibrational formation entropy and attempt frequency of the transition rates on point defects such as vacancies and interstitials.},

In the case of the KFE, a parabolic PDE in divergence form, we perform a matched asymptotic expansion up to first order in the small mean-reversion time. The solutions are expressed in terms of suitable PDEs with coefficients averaged over the ergodic distribution, in the spirit of extensive earlier work on the backward equation (see [J.-P. Fouque et al., Multiscale Stochastic Volatility for Equity, Interest Rate, and Credit Derivatives, Cambridge, University Press, 2011]). We then construct a sequence of approximations to the Zakai equation, a parabolic stochastic PDE (SPDE), and verify numerically for the first two terms weak convergence order half and order one, respectively, in the mean-reversion parameter. To this end, we give a novel numerical scheme for the original two-dimensional SPDE, which is robust in the small parameter regime, and compare derived functionals of marginals against those approximated by the solution of a sequence of homogenized one-dimensional SPDEs.},

The effective model is of micro-macro type and features strong nonlinear couplings. Here, we prove global existence in time and uniqueness for the effective micro-macro model under a smallness assumption for the data of the macroscopic elasticity subproblem. Moreover, we show numerically the convergence of microscopic solutions towards the solution of the effective model when the scale parameter becomes smaller and smaller, and also compute the approximation error. The numerical justification of the formally derived effective micro-macro model is particularly important, as rigorous analytical convergence proofs or error estimates are not available so far. Finally, we compare the effective micro-macro model with alternative, simpler effective descriptions of transport in elastic perforated media.},

The main idea is to first establish a local splitting of the solution over a local region by a local bubble part and local harmonic extension part, and then derive a global splitting by means of partition of unity. This facilitates a representation of the solution as a summation of a global bubble part and a global harmonic extension part, where the first part can be computed locally in parallel. To approximate the second part, we construct an edge multiscale ansatz space locally with hierarchical bases as the local boundary data that has a guaranteed approximation rate both inside and outside of the layers. The key innovation of this proposed WEMsFEM lies in a provable convergence rate with little restriction on the mesh size. Its convergence rate with respect to the computational degree of freedom is rigorously analyzed, which is verified by extensive 2-d and 3-d numerical tests.},

The high-order system turns out to be dispersive and exhibits solitary-wave formation, in close agreement with direct numerical simulations of the original system.

The presented method is based on a recently introduced localization technique that enforces a super-exponential decay of the basis functions relative to the underlying coarse mesh, resulting in considerable computational savings during the sampling phase. More generally, the collocation-type structure offers a particularly simple and computationally efficient construction in the stochastic setting with minimized communication between the patches where the basis functions of the method are computed. An error analysis that bridges numerical homogenization and the quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization is performed. In a series of numerical experiments, we study the effect of the correlation length and the discretization parameters on the approximation quality of the method.},

On a long time scale, the dynamics tend to a nonlinear diffusion-type equation called the Rosseland approximation. The main challenges for constructing numerical schemes that exhibit the correct limiting behavior are posed by the solution’s high-dimensional phase space and multiscale effects. In this work, we propose an asymptotic-preserving and rank-adaptive dynamical low-rank approximation scheme based on the macro-micro decomposition of the particle density and a modified augmented basis-update and Galerkin integrator. We show that this scheme, for linear particle emission by the material, dissipates energy over time under a step size restriction that captures the hyperbolic and parabolic CFL conditions.

Childs, Comm. Math. Phys., 294 (2010), pp. 581–603], and [R. Kothari, Efficient Simulation of Hamiltonians, M.S. thesis, University of Waterloo, 2010]), the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution is typically , which essentially states that one cannot go across the multiple scales as the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be strictly greater than the physical time. We demonstrated in the context of the semiclassical Schrödinger equation that the computational cost for a class of observables can be much lower than the state-of-the-art bounds. In the semiclassical regime (the effective Planck constant ), the operator norm of the Hamiltonian is . We show that the number of Trotter steps used for the observable evolution can be , that is, to simulate some observables of the Schrödinger equation on a quantum scale only takes the simulation time comparable to the classical scale. In terms of error analysis, we improve the additive observable error bounds in [C. Lasser and C. Lubich, Acta Numer., 29 (2020), pp. 229–401] to uniform-in- observable error bounds. This is, to our knowledge, the first uniform observable error bound for the semiclassical Schrödinger equation without sacrificing the convergence order of the numerical method. Based on semiclassical calculus and discrete microlocal analysis, our result showcases the potential improvements taking advantage of multiscale properties, such as the smallness of the effective Planck constant, and of the underlying dynamics, and sheds light on going across the scale for quantum dynamics simulation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is widely admitted in the heat transfer community that a steady laminar flow in a periodic channel becomes periodically developed after a small distance from the channel inlet. In this article, we provide a mathematical proof of this result for steady incompressible Stokes flows. Assuming the strip is a juxtaposition of periodic unit cells with a prescribed velocity at the inlet and a zero normal-stress boundary condition at the outlet, we prove that the velocity and pressure fields can be approximated up to exponentially small errors as by the sum of two terms: (i) a periodic velocity field driven by a constant pressure gradient propagating the input mass flow through the channel, and (ii) two boundary layer terms carrying zero mass and decaying exponentially away from the inlet and outlet boundaries. The periodically developed part of the flow can be computed by solving a periodic cell problem very similar to the one commonly encountered in periodic homogenization. The two boundary layer terms are the solutions to two Stokes problems posed in semi-infinite strips; they capture the transitory behavior between the inlet and outlet boundaries and the periodically developed region of the flow. We demonstrate the consistency of our mathematical result by numerical verifications on a number of two-dimensional flow geometries which showcase an excellent accuracy of the obtained asymptotic expansions. We complete our work by stating a homogenization result for a fluid flowing in a thin periodic strip of width with prescribed inlet and outlet boundary conditions. We obtain that the effective velocity and pressure fields are governed by Darcy’s law with a permeability constant predicted by classical periodic homogenization. Moreover, we identify the effective boundary conditions satisfied by the homogenized flow field, which are (i) a prescribed normal velocity at the inlet and (ii) a zero pressure boundary condition at the outlet.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a hyperbolic closure for the Grad moment expansion of the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) kinetic model using a neural network (NN) trained on BGK’s moment data. This closure is motivated by the exact closure for the free streaming limit that we derived in our paper on closures in transport [J. Huang et al., J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941]. The exact closure relates the gradient of the highest moment to the gradient of four lower moments. As with our past work, the model presented here learns the gradient of the highest moment in terms of the coefficients of gradients for all lower ones. By necessity, this means that the resulting hyperbolic system is not conservative in the highest moment. For stability, the output layers of the NN are designed to enforce hyperbolicity and Galilean invariance. This ensures the model can be run outside of the training window of the NN. Unlike our previous work on radiation transport that dealt with linear models, the BGK model’s nonlinearity demanded advanced training tools. These comprised an optimal learning rate discovery, one-cycle training, batch normalization in each neural layer, and the use of the AdamW optimizer. To address the nonconservative structure of the hyperbolic model, we adopt the FORCE numerical method to achieve robust solutions. This results in a comprehensive computing model combining learned closures with methods for solving hyperbolic models. The proposed model generalizes beyond the training time window for low to moderate Knudsen numbers. Our paper details the multiscale model construction and is run on a range of test problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the propagation of surface waves across structured surfaces with random, localized inhomogeneities. A discrete analogue of the Gurtin–Murdoch model is employed, and surface elasticity, in contrast to bulk elasticity, is captured by distinct point masses and elastic constants for nearest-neighbor interactions parallel to the surface. Expressions for the surface wave reflectance and transmittance, as well as the radiative loss, are provided for every localized patch of point mass perturbation on the surface. As the main result in the article, we provide the statistics of surface wave reflectance and transmittance and the radiative loss for an ensemble of random mass perturbations, independent and identically distributed with mean zero, on the surface. In the weakly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to be proportional to the size of the perturbed patch, to the variance of the mass perturbations, and to an effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum of the unperturbed system. In the strongly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to depend on another effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum, but not on the variance of the mass perturbations. Numerical simulations are found in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions for several illustrative values of the surface structure parameters.},

This is Part II of our paper in which we prove finite time blowup of the two-dimensional Boussinesq and three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with smooth initial data of finite energy and boundary. In Part I of our paper [Chen and Hou, preprint, arXiv:2210.07191, 2022], we establish an analytic framework to prove the nonlinear stability of an approximate self-similar blowup profile using a combination of weighted and weighted energy estimates. We reduce proving nonlinear stability to verifying several inequalities for the constants in the energy estimate which depend on the approximate steady state and the weights in the energy functional only. In Part II of our paper, we construct approximate space-time solutions with rigorous error control, which are used to obtain sharp stability estimates of the linearized operator in Part I. We also obtain sharp estimates of the velocity in the regular case using numerical integration with computer assistance. These results enable us to verify that the constants in the energy estimate obtained in Part I [Chen and Hou, preprint, arXiv:2210.07191, 2022] indeed satisfy the inequalities for nonlinear stability. The nonlinear stability further implies the finite time singularity of the axisymmetric three-dimensional Euler equations with smooth initial data and boundary.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In biomechanics, local phenomena, such as tissue perfusion, are strictly related to the global features of the surrounding blood circulation. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous model where a local, accurate, three-dimensional (3D) description of tissue perfusion by means of fluid flows through deformable porous media equations is coupled with a systemic, 0D, lumped model of the remainder of the circulation, where the fluid flow through a vascular network is described via its analogy with a current flowing through an electric circuit. This represents a multiscale strategy, which couples an initial boundary value problem to be used in a specific tissue region with an initial value problem in the surrounding circulatory system. This PDE/ODE coupling leads to interface conditions enforcing the continuity of mass and the balance of stresses across models at different scales, and careful consideration is taken to address this interface mismatch. The resulting system involves PDEs of mixed type with interface conditions depending on nonlinear ODEs. A new result on local existence of solutions for this multiscale interface coupling is provided in this article.},
