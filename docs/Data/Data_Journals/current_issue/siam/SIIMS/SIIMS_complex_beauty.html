Two prominent algorithms in this area are Plug-and-Play (PnP) and Regularization-by-Denoising (RED). We consider two specific algorithms, PnP-FISTA and RED-APG, where regularization is performed by replacing the proximal operator in the FISTA algorithm with a powerful denoiser. The iterate convergence of FISTA is known to be challenging with no universal guarantees. Yet, we show that for linear inverse problems and a class of linear denoisers, global linear convergence of the iterates of PnP-FISTA and RED-APG can be established through simple spectral analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Previous Retinex-based methods simultaneously estimate illumination and reflectance, complicating model design and potentially impacting image enhancement due to flawed prior assumptions. In this paper, we explore the physical basis of low-light image enhancement, focusing on contrast, saturation, and brightness, and propose an adaptive contrast-saturation (ConSat) model. Our ConSat innovation simplifies model design by focusing solely on a brightness enhancement function, allowing for precise image brightness control while keeping colors natural and realistic. We design a new saturation metric that assesses pixel dispersion from the mean of RGB channels, accurately depicting exposure variations across the image. On this basis, we propose a smart contrast stretching function that adapts contrast adjustments to enhance images under varying light. It boosts contrast in dark, low-saturation areas to clarify details and textures, while curbing it in bright, high-saturation areas to prevent overexposure and color distortion. Finally, we employ a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoiser to achieve satisfactory visual appeal. Numerical experiments show that our ConSat is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in brightness improvement, noise removal, and artifact elimination.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article introduces a novel approach to learning monotone neural networks (NNs) through a newly defined penalization loss. The proposed method is particularly effective in solving classes of variational problems, specifically monotone inclusion problems, commonly encountered in image processing tasks. The forward-backward-forward (FBF) algorithm is employed to address these problems, offering a solution even when the Lipschitz constant of the NN is unknown. Notably, the FBF algorithm provides convergence guarantees under the condition that the learned operator is monotone. Building on plug-and-play methodologies, our objective is to apply these newly learned operators to solving nonlinear inverse problems. To achieve this, we initially formulate the problem as a variational inclusion problem. Subsequently, we train a monotone NN to approximate an operator that may not inherently be monotone. Leveraging the FBF algorithm, we then show simulation examples where the nonlinear inverse problem is successfully solved.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Homogeneous diffusion inpainting can reconstruct missing image areas with high quality from a sparse subset of known pixels, provided that their location as well as their gray or color values are well optimized. This property is exploited in inpainting-based image compression, which is a promising alternative to classical transform-based codecs such as JPEG and JPEG2000. However, optimizing the inpainting data is a challenging task. Current approaches are either fairly slow or do not produce high quality results. As a remedy we propose fast spatial and tonal optimization algorithms for homogeneous diffusion inpainting that efficiently utilize GPU parallelism, with a careful adaptation of some of the most successful numerical concepts. We propose a densification strategy using ideas from error-map dithering combined with a Delaunay triangulation for the spatial optimization. For the tonal optimization we design a domain decomposition solver that solves the corresponding normal equations in a matrix-free fashion and supplement it with a Voronoi-based initialization strategy. With our proposed methods we are able to generate high quality inpainting masks for homogeneous diffusion and optimized tonal values in a runtime that outperforms prior state-of-the-art by a wide margin.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multilayer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC) is a powerful technique for obtaining parsimonious representations of signals in machine learning applications. However, achieving maximum parsimony without sacrificing data fidelity requires learning a dictionary from data, resulting in the nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem of multilayer convolutional dictionary learning (ML-CDL). Existing ML-CDL solvers derived from traditional dictionary learning employ the convex function as the sparsity-inducing function to promote convergence; nevertheless, analyzing the convergence of candidate alternate optimization schemes is still challenging. In this paper, we reformulate the ML-CDL problem by replacing the convolution with the Hadamard product to reduce computational complexity, and to achieve this without destroying the consistency between the variables in the time and frequency domains, additional constraints are introduced to the reformulated problem. We also modify a forward-backward splitting algorithm to solve the reformulated ML-CDL problem using simultaneous coefficients and dictionary element updates across all layers. In contrast, these variables are updated alternately in the previous approaches. The proposed algorithm includes a parameter adaptation scheme to improve optimization performance and ensure convergence. In numerical simulations, the proposed method outperforms existing methods by achieving convergence in fewer iterations and generating a smaller final functional value. The high quality of recovered images demonstrates the applicability of multilayer sparse representation to image reconstruction.},

Finding a transformation between two unknown probability distributions from finite samples is crucial for modeling complex data distributions and performing tasks such as sample generation, domain adaptation, and statistical inference. One powerful framework for such transformations is normalizing flow, which transforms an unknown distribution into a standard normal distribution using an invertible network. In this paper, we introduce a novel model called SyMOT-Flow, which trains an invertible transformation by minimizing the symmetric maximum mean discrepancy between samples from two unknown distributions, and an optimal transport cost is incorporated as regularization to obtain a short-distance and interpretable transformation. The resulting transformation leads to more stable and accurate sample generation. Several theoretical results are established for the proposed model, and its effectiveness is validated with illustrative low-dimensional examples as well as high-dimensional bimodality medical image generation through the forward and reverse flows.},

We propose a novel model for decomposing grayscale images into three distinct components: the structural part, representing sharp boundaries and regions with strong light-to-dark transitions; the smooth part, capturing soft shadows and shades; and the oscillatory part, characterizing textures and noise. To capture the homogeneous structures, we introduce a combination of -gradient and curvature regularization on level lines. This new regularization term enforces strong sparsity on the image gradient while reducing the undesirable staircase effects as well as preserving the geometry of contours. For the smoothly varying component, we utilize the -norm of the Laplacian that favors isotropic smoothness. To capture the oscillation, we use the inverse Sobolev seminorm. To solve the associated minimization problem, we design an efficient operator-splitting algorithm. Our algorithm effectively addresses the challenging nonconvex nonsmooth problem by separating it into subproblems. Each subproblem can be solved either directly using closed-form solutions or efficiently using the fast Fourier transform. We provide systematic experiments, including ablation and comparison studies, to analyze our model’s behaviors and demonstrate its effectiveness as well as efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Interactive segmentation allows users to provide meaningful input to guide the segmentation process. However, an important problem in interactive segmentation lies in determining how to incorporate minimal yet meaningful user guidance into the segmentation model. In this paper, we propose the quasi-conformal interactive segmentation (QIS) model, which incorporates user input in the form of positive and negative clicks. Users mark a few pixels belonging to the object region as positive clicks, indicating that the segmentation model should include a region around these clicks. Conversely, negative clicks are provided on pixels belonging to the background, instructing the model to exclude the region near these clicks from the segmentation mask. By solving our proposed theoretical supported model, the segmentation mask is obtained by deforming a template mask with the same topology as the object of interest using a quasi-conformal mapping. This approach makes each user input effectively used and helps to avoid topological errors in the segmentation results. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed model for its ability to include or exclude regions of interest or disinterest based on the user’s indication. To evaluate the performance of QIS, we conduct experiments on synthesized images, medical images, and natural images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.},

Our new theoretical results provide convergence guarantees of the direct extension of ADMM (E-ADMM) without Lipschitz continuity of the gradient and Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property, and establish the worst-case convergence rate in the nonergodic sense. Under further conditions such as Lipschitz continuity and nonsingularity, we derive the global linear rate of convergence.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce two quasi-Newton forward-backward splitting algorithms to solve a class of monotone inclusion problems. The bottleneck is the evaluation of the resolvent operator. Changing the metric makes its computation even harder, and this is even true for a simple operator whose resolvent is known for the standard metric. To fully exploit the advantage of adapting the metric, we develop a new efficient resolvent calculus for a low-rank perturbed standard metric, which accounts exactly for quasi-Newton metrics. Moreover, we prove the convergence of our algorithms, including linear convergence rates in case one of the two considered operators is strongly monotone. As a by-product of our general monotone inclusion framework, we introduce two variants of the quasi-Newton primal-dual hybrid gradient method (PDHG) for solving saddle point problems. The favorable performance of these two quasi-Newton PDHG methods is demonstrated on several numerical experiments in image processing.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we address the problem of registering multiple point clouds corrupted with high anisotropic localization noise. Our approach follows the widely used framework of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) reconstruction with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Existing methods are based on an implicit assumption of spatially invariant isotropic Gaussian noise. However, this assumption is violated in practice in applications such as single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). To address this issue, we propose to introduce an explicit localization noise model that decouples shape modeling with the GMM from noise handling. We use this model for multiview point cloud registration by designing an EM algorithm that considers noise-free data as a latent variable, with closed-form solutions at each EM step. The first advantage of our approach is to handle spatially varying and anisotropic Gaussian noise. The second advantage is to leverage the explicit noise model to impose prior knowledge about the noise that may be available from physical sensors. We show on various simulated data that our noise handling strategy improves significantly the robustness to high levels of anisotropic noise. We also demonstrate the performance of our method on real SMLM data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multispectral images contain light information in different wavelengths of objects, which convey spectral-spatial information and help improve the performance of various image processing tasks. Numerous techniques have been developed to extend the application of total variation regularization in restoring multispectral images, for example, based on channel coupling and adaptive total variation regularization. The primary contribution of this paper is to propose and develop a new multispectral total variation regularization in a generalized opponent transformation domain instead of the original multispectral image domain. Here, opponent transformations for multispectral images are generalized from a well-known opponent transformation for color images. We will explore the properties of generalized opponent transformation total variation (GOTTV) regularization and the corresponding optimization method for multispectral image restoration. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed GOTTV method, we provide numerical examples that showcase its superior performance compared to existing multispectral image total variation methods, using criteria such as mean peak signal-to-noise ratio and mean structural similarity index.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Blind image deblurring is one of the most critical issues in digital image processing. The main goal of blind image deblurring is to estimate the blur kernel and the intermediate image with a blurry image as input. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for blind image deblurring based on the image smoothing priors. We notice that the salient edge is significant in estimating the blur kernel. If we can find a strategy that can preserve the salient edges of images and smooth out unnecessary details in the deblurring process, the estimated blur kernel will be more accurate. According to this observation, we draw on the experience of image smoothing and propose a new model based on the smoothing priors. For binary images, we extend our model by considering binary constraints. We also extend our method to the nonuniform deblurring problem. Numerically, we use the half-quadratic splitting method to minimize the optimization problem. We also propose a new template-based interpolated algorithm to solve the minimization problem. In the experiment part, we test our method on various datasets to show its effectiveness. Compared with other related methods, our method can estimate blur kernels more accurately and generate fewer artifacts.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recently, the problem of one-bit tensor completion (1BTC) has garnered increasing attention and has been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally. However, prior works heavily relied on the precise knowledge on the distribution of the dither (i.e., the noise prior to one-bit quantization), which is not applicable to applications that involve unknown prequantization noise. The main goal of this paper is to address this limitation and develop a 1BTC method robust to both noise and corruption. Within the framework of tensor SVD, we demonstrate the robustness by studying the following two settings: (i) 1BTC under sub-Gaussian noises, and (ii) a more challenging scenario where sparse corruptions (besides sub-Gaussian noise) also are present. Built upon a novel usage of an -loss function in 1BTC, we propose regularized Lasso for the first setting and a constrained Lasso for the second setting, and both recovery programs are accompanied by theoretical recovery guarantees. We establish nearly matching minimax lower bounds for both settings with unquantized observations, which demonstrates that our recovery methods are near-optimal and the proposed quantization scheme only induces minor information loss. Moreover, we propose optimization algorithms and conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to validate our theory and the robustness of our method.},

Motivated by a class of nonlinear imaging inverse problems, for instance, multispectral computed tomography (MSCT), this paper studies the convergence theory of the nonlinear Kaczmarz method (NKM) for solving the system of nonlinear equations with componentwise convex mapping, namely, the function corresponding to each equation being convex. Such kind of nonlinear mapping may not satisfy the commonly used componentwise tangential cone condition (TCC). For this purpose, we propose a novel condition named relative gradient discrepancy condition (RGDC) and make use of it to prove the convergence and even the convergence rate of the NKM with several general index selection strategies, where these strategies include the cyclic strategy and the maximum residual strategy. Particularly, we investigate the application of the NKM for solving nonlinear systems in MSCT image reconstruction. We prove that the nonlinear mappings in this context fulfill the proposed RGDC rather than the componentwise TCC and provide a global convergence of the NKM based on the previously obtained results. Numerical experiments further illustrate the numerical convergence of the NKM for MSCT image reconstruction.},

We propose a unified view of nonlocal methods for single-image denoising, for which BM3D is the most popular representative, that operate by gathering noisy patches together according to their similarities in order to process them collaboratively. Our general estimation framework is based on the minimization of the quadratic risk, which is approximated in two steps, and adapts to photon and electronic noises. Relying on an unbiased risk estimate (URE) for the first step and on “internal adaptation,” a concept borrowed from deep learning theory, for the second, we show that our approach enables one to reinterpret and reconcile previous state-of-the-art nonlocal methods. Within this framework, we propose a novel denoiser called NL-Ridge that exploits linear combinations of patches. While conceptually simpler, we show that NL-Ridge can outperform well-established state-of-the-art single-image denoisers.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cardiac pulsations in the human brain have received recent interest due to their possible role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Further interest stems from their possible application as an endogenous signal source that can be utilized for brain imaging in general. The (pulse-)wave describing the blood flow velocity along an intracranial artery consists of a forward (anterograde) and a backward (retrograde, reflected) part, but measurements of this wave usually consist of a superposition of these components. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for the inverse problem of estimating the pulse wave velocity, as well as the forward and backward components of the pulse wave separately from MRI measurements on intracranial arteries. After a mathematical analysis of this problem, we consider possible reconstruction approaches and derive an alternate direction approach for its solution. The resulting methods provide estimates for anterograde/retrograde wave forms and the pulse wave velocity under specified assumptions on a cerebrovascular model system. Numerical experiments on simulated and experimental data demonstrate the applicability and preliminary in vivo feasibility of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we study the subspace clustering and recovery of multidimensional images. Existing matrix-based/tensor-based subspace clustering methods successfully consider unilateral information (i.e., the similarity between image samples) to cluster samples into subspaces by using low-rank representation. The key issue of the unilateral representation-based methods is that the number of samples in each subspace should be sufficient for subspace representation. In practice, the clustering performance can be degraded when there is only a small number of observed samples in each subspace. To address the problem of insufficient observed samples, we propose to introduce hidden tensor data to supplement an insufficient number of observed samples. We employ both observed samples and hidden tensor data under low-rank constraints so that a new bilateral tensor low-rank representation (BTLRR) in subspace clustering is formulated. We show that a closed-form solution of block-diagonal tensor structure is obtained in subspace clustering of observed samples and hidden tensor data. Also the proposed BTLRR optimization problem can be solved by using the convex relaxation technique and augmented Lagrangian multiplier algorithm. The proposed BTLRR can fully explore the bilateral information of observations, including not only the similarity between samples but also the relationship among features. Extensive numerical results on multidimensional image data clustering and recovery illustrate that the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed bilateral representation are better than those of state-of-the-art methods (e.g., the popular LRR and TLRR methods).},

The sliced-Wasserstein flow is an evolution equation where a probability density evolves in time, advected by a velocity field computed as the average among directions in the unit sphere of the optimal transport displacements from its one-dimensional projections to the projections of a fixed target measure. This flow happens to be the gradient flow in the usual Wasserstein space of the squared sliced-Wasserstein distance to the target. We consider the question whether in long-time the flow converges to the target (providing a positive result when the target is Gaussian) and the question of the long-time limit of the flow map obtained by following the trajectories of each particle. We prove that this limit is, in general, not the optimal transport map from the starting measure to the target.
