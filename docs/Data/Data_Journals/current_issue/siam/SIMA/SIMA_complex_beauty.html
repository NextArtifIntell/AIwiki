A uniform estimate with respect to the Knudsen number is established globally in time, which eventually leads to the global existence of solutions to the one-species Vlasov‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann system and hydrodynamic limit to the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes‚ÄìFourier‚ÄìMaxwell system.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary value problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness, and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Kantorovich potentials denote the dual solutions of the renowned optimal transportation problem. Uniqueness of these solutions is relevant from both a theoretical and an algorithmic point of view and has recently emerged as a necessary condition for asymptotic results in the context of statistical and entropic optimal transport. In this work, we challenge the common perception that uniqueness in continuous settings is reliant on the connectedness of the support of at least one of the involved measures, and we provide mild sufficient conditions for uniqueness even when both measures have disconnected support. Since our main finding builds upon the uniqueness of Kantorovich potentials on connected components, we revisit the corresponding arguments and provide generalizations of well-known results. To this end, we introduce the notion of induced regularity and employ it to extend the regularity theory of Kantorovich potentials advanced by Gangbo and McCann [Acta Math., 177 (1996), pp. 113‚Äì161] to more general cost functions in and to geodesic spaces.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns the scattering problem for a nonlinear medium of compact support, with second-harmonic generation. Such a medium, when probed with monochromatic light beams at frequency , generates additional waves at frequency . The response of the medium is governed by a system of two coupled semilinear PDEs for the electric fields at frequencies and . We investigate whether there are situations in which the generated wave is localized inside , that is, whether the nonlinear interaction of the medium with the probing wave is invisible to an outside observer. This leads to the analysis of a semilinear elliptic system formulated in with nonstandard boundary conditions. The analysis presented here sets up a mathematical framework needed to investigate a multitude of questions related to nonlinear scattering with second-harmonic generation.},

Under some assumptions on the initial data that can be arbitrarily large, a global existence-uniqueness result on the strong solution with far field vacuum is derived. The interaction between the degenerate viscosity and the pressure is the main issue. A series of new global a priori estimates for both the velocity and the effective velocity allow that the adiabatic index can be equal to 1 which is exactly the isothermal case. This work can be viewed as the first result on the global existence and uniqueness of a large solution to the isothermal case with degenerate viscosity and vacuum.},

Both the total initial energy and the initial mass are allowed to be unbounded, and the doping profile is allowed to be of large variation. This is achieved by adapting a class of degenerate density-dependent viscosity terms, so that a rigorous proof of the inviscid limit of global weak solutions of the Navier‚ÄìStokes‚ÄìPoisson equations with the density-dependent viscosity terms to the corresponding global solutions of the Euler‚ÄìPoisson equations for plasma with doping profile can be established. New difficulties arise when tackling the nonzero varied doping profile, which have been overcome by establishing some novel estimates for the electric field terms so that the neutrality assumption on the initial data is avoided. In particular, we prove that no concentration is formed in the inviscid limit for the finite relative-energy solutions of the compressible Euler‚ÄìPoisson equations with large doping profiles in plasma physics.},
