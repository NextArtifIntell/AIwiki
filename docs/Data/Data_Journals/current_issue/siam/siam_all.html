We present a systematic study of conditional triangular transport maps in function spaces from the perspective of optimal transportation and with a view towards amortized Bayesian inference. More specifically, we develop a theory of constrained optimal transport problems that describe block-triangular Monge maps that characterize conditional measures along with their Kantorovich relaxations. This work generalizes the theory of optimal triangular transport to separable infinite dimensional function spaces with general cost functions. We further tailor our results to the case of Bayesian inference problems and obtain regularity estimates on the conditioning maps from the prior to the posterior. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the computational applicability of our theoretical results for amortized and likelihood-free inference of functional parameters.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many recent and often (adaptive) Markov chain Monte Carlo (A)MCMC methods are associated in practice to unknown rates of convergence. We propose a simulation-based methodology to estimate and compare MCMC’s performance in terms of shortest burn-in time, using a Kullback divergence criterion requiring an estimate of the entropy of the algorithm densities at each iteration, computed from i.i.d. simulated chains. In previous works, we proved some consistency results in an MCMC setup for an entropy estimate based on Monte Carlo integration of a kernel density estimate proposed in [L. Györfi and E. C. Van Der Meulen, An entropy estimate based on a kernel density estimation, in Limit Theorems in Probability and Statistics, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1989, pp. 229–240], and we investigate an alternative nearest neighbor (NN) entropy estimate from [L. Kozachenko and N. N. Leonenko, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii, 23 (1987), pp. 9–16]. This estimate has been used mostly in univariate situations until recently, when entropy estimation in higher dimensions has been considered in other fields like neuroscience or system biology. Unfortunately, in higher dimensions, both estimators converge slowly with a noticeable bias. The present work goes several steps further, with bias reduction and automatic (A)MCMC burn-in time analysis in mind. First, for bias reduction, we apply in our situation a “crossed NN-type” nonparametric estimate of the Kullback divergence between two densities, based on i.i.d. samples from each, introduced by [Q. Wang, S. R. Kulkarni, and S. Verdú, A nearest-neighbor approach to estimating divergence between continuous random vectors, in IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, Seattle, WA, 2006, pp. 242–246], [Q. Wang, S. R. Kulkarni, and S. Verdú, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 55 (2009), pp. 2392–2405]. We prove the consistency of these entropy estimates under recent uniform control conditions, for the successive densities of a generic class of MCMC algorithm to which most of the methods proposed in the recent literature belong. Second, we propose an original solution based on a PCA for reducing relevant dimension and bias in even higher dimensions whenever PCA is efficient. Our algorithms for MCMC simulation and entropy estimation are progressively added to the R package EntropyMCMC, taking advantage of recent advances in high-performance (parallel) computing.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Optimization under uncertainty is important in many applications, particularly to inform policy and decision making in areas such as public health. A key source of uncertainty arises from the incorporation of environmental variables as inputs into computational models or simulators. Such variables represent uncontrollable features of the optimization problem, and reliable decision making must account for the uncertainty they propagate to the simulator outputs. Often, multiple, competing objectives are defined from these outputs such that the final optimal decision is a compromise between different goals. Here, we present emulation-based optimization methodology for such problems that extends expected quantile improvement (EQI) to address multiobjective optimization. Focusing on the practically important case of two objectives, we use a sequential design strategy to identify the Pareto front of optimal solutions. Uncertainty from the environmental variables is integrated out using Monte Carlo samples from the simulator. Interrogation of the expected output from the simulator is facilitated by use of (Gaussian process) emulators. The methodology is demonstrated on an optimization problem from public health involving the dispersion of anthrax spores across a spatial terrain. Environmental variables include meteorological features that impact the dispersion, and the methodology identifies the Pareto front even when there is considerable input uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Functional data are ubiquitous in scientific modeling. For instance, quantities of interest are modeled as functions of time, space, energy, density, etc. Uncertainty quantification methods for computer models with functional response have resulted in tools for emulation, sensitivity analysis, and calibration that are widely used. However, many of these tools do not perform well when the computer model’s parameters control both the amplitude variation of the functional output and its alignment (or phase variation). This paper introduces a framework for Bayesian model calibration when the model responses are misaligned functional data. The approach generates two types of data out of the misaligned functional responses: (1) aligned functions so that the amplitude variation is isolated and (2) warping functions that isolate the phase variation. These two types of data are created for the computer simulation data (both of which may be emulated) and the experimental data. The calibration approach uses both types so that it seeks to match both the amplitude and phase of the experimental data. The framework is careful to respect constraints that arise, especially when modeling phase variation, and is framed in a way that it can be done with readily available calibration software. We demonstrate the techniques on two simulated data examples and on two dynamic material science problems: a strength model calibration using flyer plate experiments and an equation of state model calibration using experiments performed on the Sandia National Laboratories’ Z-machine.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Inspired by multifidelity methods in computer simulations, this article introduces procedures for designing surrogates for the input/output relationship of a high-fidelity code. These surrogates should be learned from runs of both the high-fidelity and low-fidelity codes and be accompanied by error guarantees that are deterministic rather than stochastic. For this purpose, the article advocates a framework tied to a theory focusing on worst-case guarantees, namely optimal recovery. The multifidelity considerations triggered new theoretical results in three scenarios: the globally optimal estimation of linear functionals, the globally optimal approximation of arbitrary quantities of interest in Hilbert spaces, and their locally optimal approximation, still within Hilbert spaces. The latter scenario boils down to the determination of the Chebyshev center for the intersection of two hyperellipsoids. It is worth noting that the mathematical framework presented here, together with its possible extension, seems to be relevant in several other contexts briefly discussed.},

The use of reduced order modeling techniques in combination with ensemble-based methods for estimating the state of systems described by nonlinear partial differential equations has been of great interest in recent years in the data assimilation community. Methods such as the multifidelity ensemble Kalman filter and the multilevel ensemble Kalman filter are recognized as state-of-the-art techniques. However, in many cases, the construction of low-fidelity models in an offline stage, before solving the data assimilation problem, prevents them from being both accurate and computationally efficient. In our work, we investigate the use of adaptive reduced basis techniques in which the approximation space is modified online by combining information extracted from a limited number of full order solutions and information extracted from reduced models trained at previous time steps. This allows us to simultaneously ensure good accuracy and low cost for the employed models and thus improve the performance of the multifidelity and multilevel methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We address the computational efficiency of finding the A-optimal Bayesian experimental design, where the observation map is based on partial differential equations and thus computationally expensive to evaluate. A-optimality is a widely used and easily interpreted criterion, that seeks the optimal experimental design by minimizing the expected conditional variance. Our study presents a novel likelihood-free approach to the A-optimal experimental design that does not require sampling or integration over the Bayesian posterior distribution. In our proposed approach, we estimate the expected conditional variance via the variance of the conditional expectation and approximate the conditional expectation using its orthogonal projection property. We derive an asymptotic error estimate for the proposed estimator of the expected conditional variance and verify it with numerical experiments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the case where the domain of the experimental design parameters is continuous. Specifically, we propose a nonlocal approximation of the conditional expectation using an artificial neural network and apply transfer learning and data augmentation to reduce the number of evaluations of the measurement model. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method greatly reduces the number of measurement model evaluations compared with widely used importance sampling-based approaches.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent studies have confirmed cardiovascular diseases remain responsible for the highest mortality rate among noncommunicable diseases. The accurate left ventricular (LV) volume estimation is critical for valid diagnosis and management of various cardiovascular conditions, but poses a significant challenge due to inherent uncertainties associated with the segmentation algorithms in magnetic resonance imaging. Recent machine learning advancements, particularly U-Net-like convolutional networks, have facilitated automated segmentation for medical images, but struggles under certain pathologies and/or different scanner vendors and imaging protocols. This study proposes a novel methodology for post-hoc uncertainty estimation in the LV volume prediction using Itô stochastic differential equations to model pathwise behavior for the prediction error. The model describes the area of the left ventricle along the heart’s long axis. The method is agnostic to the underlying segmentation algorithm, facilitating its use with various existing and future segmentation technologies. The proposed approach provides a mechanism for quantifying uncertainty, enabling medical professionals to intervene for unreliable predictions. This is of utmost importance in critical applications such as medical diagnosis, where prediction accuracy and reliability can directly impact patient outcomes. The method is also robust to dataset changes, enabling application for medical centers with limited access to labeled data. Our findings highlight the proposed uncertainty estimation methodology’s potential to enhance automated segmentation robustness and generalizability, paving the way for more reliable and accurate LV volume estimation in clinical settings as well as opening new avenues for uncertainty quantification in biomedical image segmentation, providing promising directions for future research.},

It approximates a translationally invariant covariance kernel by complex exponentials on an equispaced Cartesian frequency grid of nodes. This results in a weight-space system matrix with Toeplitz structure, which can thus be applied to a vector in operations via the fast Fourier transform (FFT), independent of the number of data points . The linear system can be set up in operations using nonuniform FFTs. This enables efficient massive-scale regression via an iterative solver, even for kernels with fat-tailed spectral densities (large ). We provide bounds on both kernel approximation and posterior mean errors. Numerical experiments for squared-exponential and Matérn kernels in one, two, and three dimensions often show 1–2 orders of magnitude acceleration over state-of-the-art rank-structured solvers at comparable accuracy. Our method allows two-dimensional Matérn- regression from data points to be performed in two minutes on a standard desktop, with posterior mean accuracy .

  abstract     = {Abstract. Engineering and applied science rely on computational experiments to rigorously study physical systems. The mathematical models used to probe these systems are highly complex, and sampling-intensive studies often require prohibitively many simulations for acceptable accuracy. Surrogate models provide a means of circumventing the high computational expense of sampling such complex models. In particular, polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) have been successfully used for uncertainty quantification studies of deterministic models where the dominant source of uncertainty is parametric. We discuss an extension to conventional PCE surrogate modeling to enable surrogate construction for stochastic computational models that have intrinsic noise in addition to parametric uncertainty. We develop a PCE surrogate on a joint space of intrinsic and parametric uncertainty, enabled by Rosenblatt transformations, which are evaluated via kernel density estimation of the associated conditional cumulative distributions. Furthermore, we extend the construction to random field data via the Karhunen–Loève expansion. We then take advantage of closed-form solutions for computing PCE Sobol indices to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the model which quantifies the intrinsic noise contribution to the overall model output variance. Additionally, the resulting joint PCE is generative in the sense that it allows generating random realizations at any input parameter setting that are statistically approximately equivalent to realizations from the underlying stochastic model. The method is demonstrated on a chemical catalysis example model and a synthetic example controlled by a parameter that enables a switch from unimodal to bimodal response distributions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper focuses on the homogenization of high-contrast dielectric elastomer composites, which are materials that deform in response to electrical stimulation. The considered heterogeneous material, consisting of an ambient material with inserted particles, is described by a weakly coupled system of an electrostatic equation with an elastic equation enriched with electrostriction. It is assumed that particles gradually become rigid as the fine-scale parameter approaches zero. This study demonstrates that the effective response of this system entails a homogeneous dielectric elastomer, described by a system of PDEs whose equations are fully decoupled. The coefficients of the homogenized equations depend on various factors, including the geometry of the composite, the periodicity of the original microstructure, and the coefficients characterizing the initial heterogeneous material. In particular, these coefficients are significantly influenced by the high-contrast nature of the coefficients of the fine-scale problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a new model reduction technique for multiscale scalar transport problems that exhibit dominant axial dynamics. Toward this aim, we rely on the separation of variables to combine a hierarchical model (HiMod) reduction with a two-scale asymptotic expansion. We extend the two-scale asymptotic expansion to an arbitrary order and exploit the high-order correctors to define the HiMod modal basis which approximates the transverse dynamics of the flow, while we adopt a finite element discretization to model the leading stream. The resulting method, which is named HiPhom (high-order projection-based homogenization), is successfully assessed both in steady and unsteady advection-diffusion-reaction settings. The numerical results confirm the very good performance of HiPhom, which improves the accuracy and the convergence rate of HiMod and extends the reliability of the standard homogenized solution to transient and preasymptotic regimes.},

The derived moment closure systems are well defined for all physically relevant moments, and the resultant approximations of the distribution function converge as the number of moments goes to infinity. The convergence makes our method stand out from most existing moment methods. Moreover, we devise a delicate moment inversion algorithm. As an application, the Vicsek model is studied for overdamped active particles, and the Poisson-EQMOM is validated with a series of numerical tests including spatially homogeneous, one-dimensional, and two-dimensional problems.},

This paper studies the physical observables of continuum Schrödinger operators for incommensurate systems. We characterize the density of states and local density of states in real and reciprocal spaces, and develop novel numerical methods to approximate them. In particular, we (i) justify the thermodynamic limit of the density of states and local density of states via the operator kernel characterization; and (ii) propose efficient numerical schemes based on plane wave approximation and the trapezoidal rule in reciprocal space.

This analysis suggests that vibrational entropy can be effectively predicted using a surrogate model for site entropy. We employ machine learning to develop such a surrogate models employing the atomic cluster expansion model. We supplement our rigorous analysis with an empirical convergence study. In addition we demonstrate the performance of our method for predicting vibrational formation entropy and attempt frequency of the transition rates on point defects such as vacancies and interstitials.},

In the case of the KFE, a parabolic PDE in divergence form, we perform a matched asymptotic expansion up to first order in the small mean-reversion time. The solutions are expressed in terms of suitable PDEs with coefficients averaged over the ergodic distribution, in the spirit of extensive earlier work on the backward equation (see [J.-P. Fouque et al., Multiscale Stochastic Volatility for Equity, Interest Rate, and Credit Derivatives, Cambridge, University Press, 2011]). We then construct a sequence of approximations to the Zakai equation, a parabolic stochastic PDE (SPDE), and verify numerically for the first two terms weak convergence order half and order one, respectively, in the mean-reversion parameter. To this end, we give a novel numerical scheme for the original two-dimensional SPDE, which is robust in the small parameter regime, and compare derived functionals of marginals against those approximated by the solution of a sequence of homogenized one-dimensional SPDEs.},

The effective model is of micro-macro type and features strong nonlinear couplings. Here, we prove global existence in time and uniqueness for the effective micro-macro model under a smallness assumption for the data of the macroscopic elasticity subproblem. Moreover, we show numerically the convergence of microscopic solutions towards the solution of the effective model when the scale parameter becomes smaller and smaller, and also compute the approximation error. The numerical justification of the formally derived effective micro-macro model is particularly important, as rigorous analytical convergence proofs or error estimates are not available so far. Finally, we compare the effective micro-macro model with alternative, simpler effective descriptions of transport in elastic perforated media.},

The main idea is to first establish a local splitting of the solution over a local region by a local bubble part and local harmonic extension part, and then derive a global splitting by means of partition of unity. This facilitates a representation of the solution as a summation of a global bubble part and a global harmonic extension part, where the first part can be computed locally in parallel. To approximate the second part, we construct an edge multiscale ansatz space locally with hierarchical bases as the local boundary data that has a guaranteed approximation rate both inside and outside of the layers. The key innovation of this proposed WEMsFEM lies in a provable convergence rate with little restriction on the mesh size. Its convergence rate with respect to the computational degree of freedom is rigorously analyzed, which is verified by extensive 2-d and 3-d numerical tests.},

The high-order system turns out to be dispersive and exhibits solitary-wave formation, in close agreement with direct numerical simulations of the original system.

This paper proposes a novel collocation-type numerical stochastic homogenization method for prototypical stochastic homogenization problems with random coefficient fields of small correlation lengths. The presented method is based on a recently introduced localization technique that enforces a super-exponential decay of the basis functions relative to the underlying coarse mesh, resulting in considerable computational savings during the sampling phase. More generally, the collocation-type structure offers a particularly simple and computationally efficient construction in the stochastic setting with minimized communication between the patches where the basis functions of the method are computed. An error analysis that bridges numerical homogenization and the quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization is performed. In a series of numerical experiments, we study the effect of the correlation length and the discretization parameters on the approximation quality of the method.},

On a long time scale, the dynamics tend to a nonlinear diffusion-type equation called the Rosseland approximation. The main challenges for constructing numerical schemes that exhibit the correct limiting behavior are posed by the solution’s high-dimensional phase space and multiscale effects. In this work, we propose an asymptotic-preserving and rank-adaptive dynamical low-rank approximation scheme based on the macro-micro decomposition of the particle density and a modified augmented basis-update and Galerkin integrator. We show that this scheme, for linear particle emission by the material, dissipates energy over time under a step size restriction that captures the hyperbolic and parabolic CFL conditions.

Kothari, Efficient Simulation of Hamiltonians, M.S. thesis, University of Waterloo, 2010]), the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution is typically , which essentially states that one cannot go across the multiple scales as the simulation time for the Hamiltonian evolution needs to be strictly greater than the physical time. We demonstrated in the context of the semiclassical Schrödinger equation that the computational cost for a class of observables can be much lower than the state-of-the-art bounds. In the semiclassical regime (the effective Planck constant ), the operator norm of the Hamiltonian is . We show that the number of Trotter steps used for the observable evolution can be , that is, to simulate some observables of the Schrödinger equation on a quantum scale only takes the simulation time comparable to the classical scale. In terms of error analysis, we improve the additive observable error bounds in [C. Lasser and C. Lubich, Acta Numer., 29 (2020), pp. 229–401] to uniform-in- observable error bounds. This is, to our knowledge, the first uniform observable error bound for the semiclassical Schrödinger equation without sacrificing the convergence order of the numerical method. Based on semiclassical calculus and discrete microlocal analysis, our result showcases the potential improvements taking advantage of multiscale properties, such as the smallness of the effective Planck constant, and of the underlying dynamics, and sheds light on going across the scale for quantum dynamics simulation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is widely admitted in the heat transfer community that a steady laminar flow in a periodic channel becomes periodically developed after a small distance from the channel inlet. In this article, we provide a mathematical proof of this result for steady incompressible Stokes flows. Assuming the strip is a juxtaposition of periodic unit cells with a prescribed velocity at the inlet and a zero normal-stress boundary condition at the outlet, we prove that the velocity and pressure fields can be approximated up to exponentially small errors as by the sum of two terms: (i) a periodic velocity field driven by a constant pressure gradient propagating the input mass flow through the channel, and (ii) two boundary layer terms carrying zero mass and decaying exponentially away from the inlet and outlet boundaries. The periodically developed part of the flow can be computed by solving a periodic cell problem very similar to the one commonly encountered in periodic homogenization. The two boundary layer terms are the solutions to two Stokes problems posed in semi-infinite strips; they capture the transitory behavior between the inlet and outlet boundaries and the periodically developed region of the flow. We demonstrate the consistency of our mathematical result by numerical verifications on a number of two-dimensional flow geometries which showcase an excellent accuracy of the obtained asymptotic expansions. We complete our work by stating a homogenization result for a fluid flowing in a thin periodic strip of width with prescribed inlet and outlet boundary conditions. We obtain that the effective velocity and pressure fields are governed by Darcy’s law with a permeability constant predicted by classical periodic homogenization. Moreover, we identify the effective boundary conditions satisfied by the homogenized flow field, which are (i) a prescribed normal velocity at the inlet and (ii) a zero pressure boundary condition at the outlet.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a hyperbolic closure for the Grad moment expansion of the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) kinetic model using a neural network (NN) trained on BGK’s moment data. This closure is motivated by the exact closure for the free streaming limit that we derived in our paper on closures in transport [J. Huang et al., J. Comput. Phys., 453 (2022), 110941]. The exact closure relates the gradient of the highest moment to the gradient of four lower moments. As with our past work, the model presented here learns the gradient of the highest moment in terms of the coefficients of gradients for all lower ones. By necessity, this means that the resulting hyperbolic system is not conservative in the highest moment. For stability, the output layers of the NN are designed to enforce hyperbolicity and Galilean invariance. This ensures the model can be run outside of the training window of the NN. Unlike our previous work on radiation transport that dealt with linear models, the BGK model’s nonlinearity demanded advanced training tools. These comprised an optimal learning rate discovery, one-cycle training, batch normalization in each neural layer, and the use of the AdamW optimizer. To address the nonconservative structure of the hyperbolic model, we adopt the FORCE numerical method to achieve robust solutions. This results in a comprehensive computing model combining learned closures with methods for solving hyperbolic models. The proposed model generalizes beyond the training time window for low to moderate Knudsen numbers. Our paper details the multiscale model construction and is run on a range of test problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the propagation of surface waves across structured surfaces with random, localized inhomogeneities. A discrete analogue of the Gurtin–Murdoch model is employed, and surface elasticity, in contrast to bulk elasticity, is captured by distinct point masses and elastic constants for nearest-neighbor interactions parallel to the surface. Expressions for the surface wave reflectance and transmittance, as well as the radiative loss, are provided for every localized patch of point mass perturbation on the surface. As the main result in the article, we provide the statistics of surface wave reflectance and transmittance and the radiative loss for an ensemble of random mass perturbations, independent and identically distributed with mean zero, on the surface. In the weakly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to be proportional to the size of the perturbed patch, to the variance of the mass perturbations, and to an effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum of the unperturbed system. In the strongly scattering regime, the mean radiative loss is found to depend on another effective parameter that depends on the continuous spectrum, but not on the variance of the mass perturbations. Numerical simulations are found in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions for several illustrative values of the surface structure parameters.},

In Part II of our paper, we construct approximate space-time solutions with rigorous error control, which are used to obtain sharp stability estimates of the linearized operator in Part I. We also obtain sharp estimates of the velocity in the regular case using numerical integration with computer assistance. These results enable us to verify that the constants in the energy estimate obtained in Part I [Chen and Hou, preprint, arXiv:2210.07191, 2022] indeed satisfy the inequalities for nonlinear stability.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In biomechanics, local phenomena, such as tissue perfusion, are strictly related to the global features of the surrounding blood circulation. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous model where a local, accurate, three-dimensional (3D) description of tissue perfusion by means of fluid flows through deformable porous media equations is coupled with a systemic, 0D, lumped model of the remainder of the circulation, where the fluid flow through a vascular network is described via its analogy with a current flowing through an electric circuit. This represents a multiscale strategy, which couples an initial boundary value problem to be used in a specific tissue region with an initial value problem in the surrounding circulatory system. This PDE/ODE coupling leads to interface conditions enforcing the continuity of mass and the balance of stresses across models at different scales, and careful consideration is taken to address this interface mismatch. The resulting system involves PDEs of mixed type with interface conditions depending on nonlinear ODEs. A new result on local existence of solutions for this multiscale interface coupling is provided in this article.},

Using normal form transformations, we establish rigorously the existence of such solutions with oscillating tails (in the time domain) that can be made arbitrarily small but finite. Due to the presence of the oscillating tails, these solutions are coined generalized -gap breathers. Using a multiple-scale analysis, we also derive a tractable amplitude equation that describes the dynamics of breathers in the limit of small amplitude. In the presence of damping, we demonstrate the existence of transition fronts that connect the trivial state to the time-periodic ones.

We examine this comparison in the wider context of discretizing stochastic differential equations with and without the Lévy area. We study stochastic advection by Lie transport and its derivation from homogenization theory, which introduces drift corrections of the same class naturally. From a numerical viewpoint, we demonstrate that performing higher order discretizations with the use of a Lévy area can also lead to the loss of conserved area and angle quantities. Such behavior is not physically expected in the Stratonovich model. From the viewpoint of homogenization, the qualitative properties of the Wong–Zakai anomaly are physically motivated as arising due to correlations from a fast and mean scale fluid decomposition.},

Here we investigate the existence of families of symmetric periodic solutions as continuation of the elliptic orbits of the three-dimensional Kepler problem for certain symmetric differentiable perturbations using Delaunay coordinates. We consider spatial perturbations of the nonrotating and the rotating Kepler problem that are invariant with respect to some discrete reflection symmetries or have axial symmetry. More precisely, we characterize the sufficient conditions for their existence, and their type of stability is studied by estimating the characteristic multipliers of the symmetric periodic solutions. In addition, we present some results which establish a relation between symmetric periodic solutions obtained by the analytical continuation method and those obtained by the averaging method for 3-DOF Hamiltonian systems. Our study first takes into account that in each method it is necessary to find points from which the initial conditions that generating the families of periodic solutions bifurcate. By imposing a discrete symmetry on the average function, we can relate the previous points. Second, we show that the non-degeneracy condition for the application of the averaging method implies the non-degeneracy condition of the Poincaré continuation method. Finally, we compare the periods and characteristic multipliers of the family of periodic solutions obtained by each method. New families of periodic solutions for the generalized hydrogen atom in external electric and magnetic fields and for the hydrogen atom in van der Waals potential combined with a magnetic field are obtained as an application of our main results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper deals with the problem of simulating dense dispersed systems composed of large numbers of particles undergoing ballistic aggregation. The most classical approaches for dealing with such problems are represented by the so-called event-driven methods. Despite being more accurate, these methods become computationally very expensive as the number of particles increases. Typically, their computational cost is proportional to the square of the number of particles, and thus they become extremely demanding as soon as this number becomes sufficiently large. An alternative approach, called time stepping, consists in evolving the problem over small time intervals and handling all collisions occurring during each time interval simultaneously. In this work, we follow this second direction and introduce a new time stepping method which recasts the problem of the multiple collisions in a minimization framework. The objective of this work is twofold: The first goal is to show that the statistical description of the resulting aggregates obtained with this new time stepping method is sufficiently close to that of the event-driven methods. The second goal consists in showing that, in terms of computational performances, this new approach is competitive and may outperform standard methodologies, especially when the number of particles becomes sufficiently large. Numerical results obtained in the case of spherical particles moving in a two-dimensional box show that these two properties are indeed satisfied.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate an interacting particle model to simulate a foraging colony of ants, where each ant is represented as an active Brownian particle. The interactions among ants are mediated through chemotaxis, aligning their orientations with the upward gradient of the pheromone field. Unlike conventional models, our study introduces a parameter that enables the reproduction of two distinctive behaviors, the well-known Keller–Segel aggregation into spots and the formation of traveling clusters, without relying on external constraints such as food sources or nests. We consider the associated mean-field limit partial differential equation (PDE) of this system and establish the analytical and numerical foundations for understanding these particle behaviors. Remarkably, the mean-field PDE not only supports aggregation spots and lane formation but also unveils a bistable region where these two behaviors compete. The patterns associated with these phenomena are elucidated by the shape of the growing eigenfunctions derived from linear stability analysis. This study not only contributes to our understanding of complex ant colony dynamics but also introduces a novel parameter-dependent perspective on pattern formation in collective systems.},

We consider a class of birth/death like process corresponding to coupled biochemical reactions and consider the problem of quantifying the variance of the molecular species in terms of the rates of the reactions. In particular, we address this problem in a configuration where a species is formed with a rate that depends nonlinearly on another spontaneously formed species. By making use of an appropriately formulated expansion based on the Newton series, in conjunction with spectral properties of the master equation, we derive an analytical expression that provides a hard bound for the variance. We show that this bound is exact when the propensities are linear, with numerical simulations demonstrating that this bound is also very close to the actual variance. An analytical expression for the covariance of the species is also derived.},

We will assume the dynamical equations of the network are known, and that the dynamics are not necessarily low-dimensional. The case of linear dynamics is treated first and leads to a definition of observation error magnification factor (OEMF) that measures the magnification of noise in the reconstruction process. Subsequently, the definition is applied to nonlinear and chaotic dynamics. Comparison of OEMF for different target/observer combinations can lead to better understanding of how to optimally observe a network. As part of the study, a computational method for reconstructing time series from partial observations is presented and analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many important qualities of plasma confinement devices can be determined via the Poincaré plot of a symplectic return map. These qualities include the locations of periodic orbits, magnetic islands, and chaotic regions of phase space. However, every evaluation of the magnetic return map requires solving an ODE, meaning a detailed Poincaré plot can be expensive to create. Here, we propose a kernel-based method of learning a single labeling function that is approximately invariant under the symplectic map. From the labeling function, we can recover the locations of invariant circles, islands, and chaos with few evaluations of the underlying symplectic map. Additionally, the labeling function comes with a residual, which serves as a measure of how invariant the label function is and therefore as an indirect measure of chaos and map complexity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Control-based continuation (CBC) is a general and systematic method to explore the dynamic response of a physical system and perform bifurcation analysis directly during experimental tests. Although CBC has been successfully demonstrated on a wide range of systems, rigorous and general approaches to designing a noninvasive controller underpinning the methodology are still lacking. In this paper, a noninvasive adaptive control strategy for a wide class of nonlinear systems with unknown parameters is proposed. We prove that the proposed adaptive control methodology is such that the states of the dynamical system track a reference signal in a noninvasive manner if and only if the reference is a response of the uncontrolled system to an excitation force. Compared to the existing literature, the proposed method does not require any a priori knowledge of some system parameters, does not require a persistent excitation, and is not restricted to linearly stable systems, facilitating the application of CBC to a much larger class of systems than before. Rigorous mathematical analyses are provided, and the proposed control method is numerically demonstrated on a range of single- and multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear systems, including a Duffing oscillator with multiple static equilibria. It is especifically shown that the unstable periodic orbits of the uncontrolled systems can be stabilized and reached, noninvasively, in controlled conditions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Suppose one wants to monitor a domain with sensors, each sensing a small ball-shaped region, but the domain is hazardous enough that one cannot control the placement of the sensors. A prohibitively large number of randomly placed sensors could be required to obtain static coverage. Instead, one can use fewer sensors by providing mobile coverage, a generalization of the static setup wherein every possible evader is detected by the moving sensors in a bounded amount of time. Here, we use topology in order to implement algorithms certifying mobile coverage that use only local data to solve the global problem. Our algorithms do not require knowledge of the sensors’ locations, only their connectivity information. We experimentally study the statistics of mobile coverage in two dynamical scenarios. We allow the sensors to move independently (billiard dynamics and Brownian motion), or to locally coordinate their dynamics (collective animal motion models). Our detailed simulations show, for example, that collective motion can enhance performance: The expected time until the mobile sensor network achieves mobile coverage is lower for the D’Orsogna collective motion model than for the billiard motion model. Further, we show that even when the probability of static coverage is low, all possible evaders can nevertheless be detected relatively quickly by the mobile sensor network.},

We prove the existence of a family of traveling wave solutions in a variant of the Zeldovich–Frank-Kamenetskii (ZFK) equation, a reaction-diffusion equation which models the propagation of planar laminar premixed flames in combustion theory. Our results are valid in an asymptotic regime which corresponds to a reaction with high activation energy, and they provide a rigorous and geometrically informative counterpart to formal asymptotic results that have been obtained for similar problems using high activation energy asymptotics. We also go beyond the existing results by (i) proving smoothness of the minimum wave speed function , where is the small parameter, and (ii) providing an asymptotic series for a flat slow manifold which plays a role in the construction of traveling wave solutions for nonminimal wave speeds . The analysis is complicated by the presence of an exponential nonlinearity which leads to two different scaling regimes as , which we refer to herein as the convective-diffusive and diffusive-reactive zones. The main idea of the proof is to use the geometric blow-up method to identify and characterize a -family of heteroclinic orbits which traverse both of these regimes, and correspond to traveling waves in the original ZFK equation. More generally, our analysis contributes to a growing number of studies which demonstrate the utility of geometric blow-up approaches to the study of dynamical systems with singular exponential nonlinearities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a well-established method to generate a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for analysis and prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems. Recently, kernel EDMD (kEDMD) has gained popularity due to its ability to resolve the challenging task of choosing a suitable dictionary by using the kernel’s canonical features and, thus, data-informed observables. In this paper, we provide the first pointwise bounds on the approximation error of kEDMD. The main idea consists of two steps. First, we show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Wendland functions are invariant under the Koopman operator. Second, exploiting that the learning problem given by regression in the native norm can be recast as an interpolation problem, we prove our novel error bounds by using interpolation estimates. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we present a purely data-driven method that uses the Loewner framework along with nonlinear optimization techniques to infer quadratic dynamical systems with affine control that admit Volterra series (VS) representations from input-output time-domain measurements. The proposed method extensively employs optimization tools for interpolating the symmetric generalized frequency response functions (GFRFs) derived in the VS framework. The GFRF estimations are obtained from the Fourier spectrum (phase and amplitude) of the quasi-steady-state system response under harmonic excitation. Appropriate treatment of these measurements under the developed framework allows the identification of low-order in-state dimension quadratic state-space models with nontrivial stable equilibria, such as in the Lorenz ’63 forced system. We thus can achieve low-order global model identification for certain classes of systems that can bifurcate to multiple equilibria after collecting measurements solely from a local stable operational regime. The advanced framework rigorously tests the identification and reduction features across various examples with increasing dimensions and varying complexities. It effectively addresses the inference of a reduced model from measurements of a viscous flow, assuming adherence to the Burgers’ model with Robin boundary conditions. These results provide new prospects for developing low-order predictive models based on input-output data suitable for control.},

Here, we present a method for the projection-based model reduction of canonical Hamiltonian systems that is variationally consistent for any choice of linear reduced basis: Hamiltonian models project to Hamiltonian models. Applicable in both intrusive and nonintrusive settings, the proposed method is energy-conserving and symplectic, with error provably decomposable into a data projection term and a term measuring deviation from canonical form. Examples from linear elasticity with realistic material parameters are used to demonstrate the advantages of a variationally consistent approach, highlighting the steady convergence exhibited by consistent models where previous methods reliant on inconsistent techniques or specially designed bases exhibit unacceptably large errors.},

First, periodic orbits in the Circular Restricted 3-Body Problem (CR3BP) representation of the Earth-Moon (EM) system were identified. A Melnikov-type function was used to identify a set of candidate points on the EM CR3BP periodic orbits to start a continuation algorithm. A pseudo-arclength continuation scheme was then used to obtain the corresponding periodic orbit families in the HR4BP when including the effect of the Sun. Bifurcation points were identified in the computed families to obtain additional orbit families.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to a combination of noise and time-varying forcing can exhibit sudden changes, critical transitions, or tipping points, where large or rapid dynamic effects arise from changes in a parameter that are small or slow. Noise-induced tipping can occur where extremes of the forcing cause the system to leave one attractor and transition to another. We consider tipping in the presence of bounded chaotic forcing; previous work has primarily modelled noise forcing via a stochastic differential equation, but this is only a good model of chaotic forcing in the “fast chaos” limit. We argue that for low amplitude chaotic forcing close to a parameter value where there is a bifurcation of the unforced system, there will be a chaotic tipping window outside of which tipping cannot happen in the limit of asymptotically slow change of that parameter. This window is trivial for a stochastically forced system. Entry into the chaotic tipping window can be via a boundary crisis/nonautonomous saddle-node bifurcation and corresponds to an exceptional trajectory of the forcing, typically by an unstable periodic orbit. We discuss an illustrative example of a chaotically forced bistable map that highlights the richness of the geometry and bifurcation structure of the dynamics in this case. If there is also a ramping of a parameter we note there is a dynamic tipping window that can also be determined in terms of unstable periodic orbits.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When the planar circular restricted 3-body problem (PCRTBP) is periodically perturbed, as occurs in many useful astrodynamics models, most unstable periodic orbits persist as whiskered tori. Intersections between stable and unstable manifolds of such tori provide natural heteroclinic pathways, enabling spacecraft to greatly modify their orbits without using propellant. However, the 2D Poincaré sections used in PCRTBP studies no longer work to find these intersections. Thus, in this study, we develop new fast methods to search for and compute such heteroclinics. First, the dynamics are used to restrict the intersection search to only certain manifold subsets, greatly reducing the required computational effort. Next, we present a massively parallel procedure for carrying out this search by representing the manifolds as discrete meshes and adapting methods from computer graphics collision detection algorithms. Implementing the method in Julia and OpenCL, we obtain a 5–7x speedup by leveraging GPUs versus CPU-only execution. Finally, we show how to use manifold parameterizations to refine the approximate intersections found in the mesh search to very high accuracy, as well as to numerically continue the connections through families of tori; the families’ Whitney differentiability enables interpolation of needed parameterizations. The ability to very rapidly find a heteroclinic intersection between tori of fixed frequencies thus allows the systematic exploration of intersections for tori of nearby frequencies as well, yielding a variety of potential zero-fuel spacecraft trajectories. We demonstrate the tools on the Jupiter–Europa planar elliptic RTBP.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. While many well-established approaches exist for phase-based reduced order modeling of tonically firing neurons, comparatively few general approaches exist for the consideration of bursting neurons in a reduced order setting. Many formal analysis strategies exploit the separation of fast and slow timescales present in most bursting neurons, but these approaches are typically ill-suited to consider emergent behavior resulting from inter-neuron coupling or other external perturbations. This work considers the development and analysis of two different model order reduction approaches valid for two different topological classes of bursting neurons. For parabolic bursters, a persistent invariant circle allows for the relatively straightforward application of the extended phase reduction approach. For elliptic bursters, the perturbed dynamics can be considered relative to a carefully chosen set of reference trajectories. Mathematical analysis and accompanying numerical illustrations demonstrate the utility of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The cyclicity problem, crucial in analyzing planar vector fields, consists of estimating the number of limit cycles emanating from monodromic singularities. Traditionally, this estimation relies on Lyapunov coefficients. However, in nonsmooth systems, besides the limit cycles bifurcating by varying the Lyapunov coefficients, monodromic singularities on the switching curve can always be split apart, yielding, under suitable conditions, a sliding region and an additional limit cycle surrounding it. This bifurcation phenomenon, known as pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, has enhanced lower-bound cyclicity estimations for monodromic singularities in Filippov systems. In this study, we push beyond the pseudo-Hopf bifurcation, demonstrating that the destruction of -monodromic tangential singularities yields at least limit cycles surrounding sliding segments. This new bifurcation phenomenon expands our understanding of limit cycle bifurcations in nonsmooth systems and, in addition to the theoretical significance, has practical relevance in various applied models involving switches and abrupt processes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Oscillations of free intracellular calcium concentration are thought to be important in the control of a wide variety of physiological phenomena, and there is long-standing interest in understanding these oscillations via the investigation of suitable mathematical models. Many of these models have the feature that different variables or terms in the model evolve on very different time-scales, which often results in the accompanying oscillations being temporally complex. Cloete et al. [J. Theoret. Biol., 503 (2020), 110390] constructed an ordinary differential equation model of calcium oscillations in hepatocytes in an attempt to understand the origin of two distinct types of oscillation observed in experiments: narrow-spike oscillations, in which rapid spikes of calcium concentration alternate with relatively long periods of quiescence, and broad-spike oscillations, in which there is a fast rise in calcium levels followed by a slower decline, then a period of quiescence. These two types of oscillation can be observed in the model if a single system parameter is varied, but the mathematical mechanisms underlying the different types of oscillations were not explored in detail in [Cloete et al., J. Theoret. Biol., 503 (2020), 1103905]. We use ideas from geometric singular perturbation theory to investigate the origin of broad-spike solutions in this model. We find that the analysis is intractable in the full model, but are able to uncover structure in particular singular limits of a related model that point to the origin of the broad-spike solutions.},

Tracking is proved using a Lyapunov stability approach. When the phases of the training network are not clustered, then the adaptive strategy also guarantees convergence of the learning weights and frequencies to those of the training network. When the phases of the training network are clustered, the adaptive strategy achieve partial convergence of the learning weights and frequencies characterized by the type of clustering of the training network. The results are illustrated by 4-node training and learning networks with a variety of clustering configurations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A numerical investigation is undertaken into the existence and stability of localized patterned states of a two-species activator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system posed on the real line. The specific system studied, originally proposed as a glycolisys model, was recently shown to feature a two-parameter bifurcation structure common to many Schnakenberg-like systems. This structure arises from a codimension-two point at which the fundamental pattern forming Turing bifurcation changes criticality. In this paper, we compute the rung states of a “snakes-and-ladders” bifurcation diagram. Owing to the nonvariational structure of reaction-diffusion systems, they represent traveling-wave solutions. Moreover, considering a parameter regime where the localized patterned solutions exist for a wide range of parameters, numerical evidence suggests a more complex topology of the bifurcation diagram reminiscent of, but different from, what has been described as foliated snaking. Finally, we investigate the emergence of branches of breather solutions, as the ratio of diffusion parameters is increased from small values. It is shown how these branches also inherit the snake structure which leads to multiplicity of stable localized breathers of arbitrary wide spatial extent. The results are argued to have wider implications for nonvariational pattern formation systems. In particular, the nascence of traveling and breather states is a first step in the onset for complex spatio-temporal localized structures with permanent dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Lambert problem originated in orbital mechanics. It is concerned with determining the initial velocity for a boundary value problem involving the dynamical constraint due to gravitational potential with additional time horizon and endpoint position constraints. Its solution has application in transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within a prescribed flight time via velocity control. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors is replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is a generalized SBP and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schrödinger factors, as we do in this work. Our analysis leads to solving a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate.},

These states are in correspondence with the explicit twisted states found in WSG and other highly symmetric networks, but in our situation there is no explicit formula due to the lack of symmetry. The method of proof is simple and robust. It allows other types of graphs like nn graphs or the boolean model and holds also for graphs defined in any simple closed curve or even a small neighborhood of the curve and for weighted graphs. It seems plausible that the method can be extended also to higher dimensions, but a more careful analysis is required.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motion polynomials (polynomials over the dual quaternions with nonzero real norm) describe rational motions. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for reduced bounded motion polynomials to admit factorizations into monic linear factors, and we give an algorithm to compute them. We can use those linear factors to construct mechanisms because the factorization corresponds to the decomposition of the rational motion into simple rotations or translations. Bounded motion polynomials always admit a factorization into linear factors after multiplying with a suitable real or quaternion polynomial. Our criterion for factorizability allows us to improve on earlier algorithms to compute a suitable real or quaternion polynomial co-factor.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is well known that the densest lattice sphere packings also typically have large kissing numbers. The sphere packing density maximization problem is known to have a solution among well-rounded lattices, of which the integer lattice is the simplest example. The integer lattice is also an example of a generic well-rounded lattice, i.e., a well-rounded lattice with a minimal kissing number. However, the integer lattice has the worst density among well-rounded lattices. In this paper, the problem of constructing explicit generic well-rounded lattices with dense sphere packings is considered. To this end, so-called tame lattices recently introduced by Damir and Mantilla-Soler are utilized. Tame lattices came to be as a generalization of the ring of integers of certain abelian number fields. The sublattices of tame lattices constructed in this paper are shown to always result in either a generic well-rounded lattice or the lattice , with density ranging between that of and . In order to find generic well-rounded lattices with densities beyond that of , explicit deformations of some known densest lattice packings are constructed, yielding a family of generic well-rounded lattices with densities arbitrarily close to the optimum. In addition to being an interesting mathematical problem in its own right, the constructions are also motivated from a more practical point of view. Namely, generic well-rounded lattices with high packing density make good candidates for lattice codes used in secure wireless communications.},

Bacterial motion is guided by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is termed a chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, experimental data was collected to infer this kernel. In this article, a PDE-constrained optimization framework is deployed to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidence supports the theoretical findings.},

We prove that, under suitable assumptions on , our model has an extreme specificity, i.e., it is capable of discriminating between different ligands, and has a high sensitivity, i.e., the response of the system does not change in a significant manner for ranges of ligands varying within several orders of magnitude. Additional quantities like the amount of energy used by the network or the time required to yield a response will be also computed.

Indeed, over the last two decades, the phenomenon has appeared in many physical applications, from acoustic and optical wave phenomena and gravity-capillary ripples to models of crystal growth and equatorial Kelvin waves. It emerges in a generic fashion in the exponential asymptotics of higher-order ordinary and partial differential equations. The intention of this work is to highlight its importance, and develop further practical methodologies for the study of higher-order Stokes phenomena, primarily for general nonintegrable problems. Our formal methodology is demonstrated through application to a second-order linear inhomogeneous ODE that exemplifies the simplest example of higher-order Stokes phenomena. In this model problem, the Borel transform can be derived explicitly, and this gives insight into the beyond-all-orders structure. We review and study additional examples, with physically important connections, including higher-order ODEs and eigenvalue problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Onsager–Machlup action functional is an important concept in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics to describe the probability of fluctuations in nonequilibrium systems. It provides a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex stochastic systems. For the diffusion process, the path integral method and the Girsanov transformation are two main approaches to construct the Onsager–Machlup functional. However, it is a long-standing challenge to apply these two methods to the jump-diffusion process, because the complexity of jump noise presents intrinsic technical barriers to deriving the Onsager–Machlup functional. In this work, we propose a new strategy to solve this problem by utilizing the equivalent probabilistic flow between the pure diffusion process and the jump-diffusion process. For the first time, we rigorously establish the closed-form expression of the Onsager–Machlup functional for jump-diffusion processes with finite jump activity, which includes an important term of the Lévy intensity at the origin. The same probability flow approach is further applied to the Lévy process with infinite jump activity and yields a time-discrete version of the Onsager–Machlup functional.},

The current series of two papers focus on a three-dimensional Lotka–Volterra competition model of differential equations with seasonal succession, which exhibits that populations experience an external periodically forced environment. In the first part of the series, we first use a novel technique to construct an index formula for the associated Poincaré map, by which we thoroughly classify the dynamics of the model into 33 classes via the equivalence relation relative to boundary dynamics. More precisely, we show that in classes 1–18, there is no positive fixed point and that every orbit tends to a certain boundary fixed point, while for classes 19–33, there exists at least one (but not necessarily unique) positive fixed point, that is, a positive harmonic time-periodic solution of the model. Among them, the dynamics is trivial in classes 19–25 and 33 provided that the positive fixed point is unique. We emphasize that, unlike the corresponding two-dimensional system, a major significant difference and difficulty for the analysis of the global dynamics for the three-dimensional system is that it may not possess the uniqueness of the positive fixed point. In the forthcoming second part of the series, we shall address the issues of (non)uniqueness of the positive fixed points for the associated Poincaré map.},

The line inclusion resists stretching and bending and is mathematically modeled using the Steigmann–Ogden surface elasticity model. The bimaterial plane consists of two linearly elastic isotropic semiplanes with different material parameters. The problem is solved by utilizing Fourier transforms of the unknown functions in each of the semiplanes. It is shown that in the most general case, the problem can be reduced to a system of two singular integral equations on the segment occupied by the inclusion. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of this system are studied by reduction to the system of Fredholm equations of the second kind. The behavior of the solutions at the ends of the inclusion is investigated. The numerical solution is obtained by using Chebyshev polynomial series approximations of the unknown functions. Parametric studies and comparisons with the known results are given.},

This integral converges if certain quantities decay at horizontal infinity, but can also be summed over periodic images in the horizontally periodic case. However, nondecaying, nonperiodic cases are also of interest, such as the interaction of periodic wave trains with noncommensurate periods (i.e., spatially quasiperiodic solutions), or nonperiodic disturbances to periodic wave trains. We therefore develop a more general single formula for the Birkhoff–Rott integral, which unifies and extends the cases of decay and periodicity. We verify that under some reasonable conditions this new version of the Birkhoff–Rott integral is the restriction to the vortex sheet of an incompressible, irrotational velocity field, with continuous normal component but with a jump in tangential velocity across the vortex sheet. We give a number of examples of nondecaying, nonperiodic sheet positions and sheet strengths for which our assumptions may be verified. While we develop this in the case of two-dimensional fluids, we expect the methodology will apply equally well to three-dimensional fluids.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The drift-diffusion model (DDM) has long been recognized as a useful representation of the algorithmic process of decision-making. Specifically, the process of selecting between two options can be considered as the accumulation of evidence subject to noise until one of two accumulation thresholds or boundaries is reached, with past experience setting a bias or drift toward one of the boundaries. In this work, we provide a mathematical analysis to compare two notions of expected reward rate associated with the DDM: the standard formulation based on a ratio of averages, and an alternative based on direct averaging of rate, where denotes reward size and denotes decision time. Both theoretical and empirical results suggest that may in fact better describe behavior in many cases. This analysis leads to a new formula for the expected frequency of decisions for arbitrary DDM parameters. It also provides insights about what criteria should be used to select DDM parameters in various settings, which may be helpful both for the design of systems that gather evidence in order to select between available options and for analyzing experimental data related to decision-making tasks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Due to their flexibility to represent almost any kind of relational data, graph-based models have enjoyed tremendous success over the past decades. While graphs are inherently only combinatorial objects, however, many prominent analysis tools are based on the algebraic representation of graphs via matrices such as the graph Laplacian, or on associated graph embeddings. Such embeddings associate to each node a set of coordinates in a vector space, a representation that can then be employed for learning tasks such as the classification or alignment of the nodes of the graph. As the geometric picture provided by embedding methods enables the use of a multitude of methods developed for vector space data, embeddings have thus gained interest from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. Inspired by trace optimization problems, often encountered in the analysis of graph-based data, here we present a method to derive ellipsoidal embeddings of the nodes of a graph, in which each node is assigned a set of coordinates in a hyperellipsoid. Our method may be seen as an alternative to popular spectral embedding techniques, with which it shares certain similarities we discuss. To illustrate the utility of the embedding we conduct a case study in which we analyze synthetic and real world networks with modular structure, and compare the results obtained with known methods in the literature.},

Given a dataset with independent observations from an unknown distribution , a sampling algorithm must output a single observation from a distribution that is close in total variation distance to while satisfying differential privacy. Sampling abstracts the goal of generating small amounts of realistic-looking data. We provide tight upper and lower bounds for the dataset size needed for this task for three natural families of distributions: arbitrary distributions on , arbitrary product distributions on , and product distributions on with bias in each coordinate bounded away from 0 and 1. We demonstrate that, in some parameter regimes, private sampling requires asymptotically fewer observations than learning a description of nonprivately; in other regimes, however, private sampling proves to be as difficult as private learning. Notably, for some classes of distributions, the overhead in the number of observations needed for private learning compared to nonprivate learning is completely captured by the number of observations needed for private sampling.},

Our algorithm is based on the unique linkage/treewidth reduction theorem for planar graphs by Adler et al. [J. Combin. Theory Ser.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Agreement tests are a generalization of low degree tests that capture a local-to-global phenomenon, which forms the combinatorial backbone of most probabilistically checkable proof (PCP) constructions. In an agreement test, a function is given by an ensemble of local restrictions. The agreement test checks that the restrictions agree when they overlap, and the main question is whether average agreement of the local pieces implies that there exists a global function that agrees with most local restrictions. There are very few structures that support agreement tests, essentially either coming from algebraic low degree tests or from direct product tests (and recently also from high-dimensional expanders). In this work, we prove a new agreement theorem which extends direct product tests to higher dimensions, analogously to how low degree tests extend linearity testing. As a corollary of our main theorem, it follows that an ensemble of small graphs on overlapping sets of vertices can be glued together to one global graph assuming they agree with each other on average. We prove the agreement theorem by (re)proving the agreement theorem for dimension 1, and then generalizing it to higher dimensions (with the dimension 1 case being the direct product test and dimension 2 being the graph case). A key technical step in our proof is the reverse union bound, which allows us to treat dependent events as if they are disjoint, and may be of independent interest. An added benefit of the reverse union bound is that it can be used to show that the “majority decoded” function also serves as a global function that explains the local consistency of the agreement theorem, a fact that was not known even in the direct product setting (dimension 1) prior to our work. Beyond the motivation to understand fundamental local-to-global structures, our main theorem allows us to lift structure theorems from the standard uniform distribution to the -biased distribution . As a simple demonstration of this paradigm, we show how the low degree testing result of Alon et al. [IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 51 (2005), pp. 4032–4039,] and Bhattacharyya et al. [Proc. 51st FOCS, IEEE, 2010, pp. 488–497], originally proved for , can be extended to the -biased hypercube , even for very small subconstant .},

In this paper, we present new algorithms that improve the state-of-the-art for provable classical/quantum algorithms for . We present the following results: (1) A new algorithm for that provides a smooth tradeoff between time complexity and memory requirement. For any positive integer , our algorithm takes time and requires memory. This tradeoff, which ranges from enumeration to sieving ( constant), is a consequence of a new time-memory tradeoff for discrete Gaussian sampling above the smoothing parameter. (2) A quantum algorithm for that runs in time and requires classical memory and qubits. In a quantum random access memory (QRAM) model, this algorithm takes only time and requires a QRAM of size , qubits and classical space. This improves over the previously fastest classical (which is also the fastest quantum) algorithm due to [D. Aggarwal et al., Solving the shortest vector problem in 2n time using discrete Gaussian sampling: Extended abstract, in Proceedings of the Forty-Seventh Annual ACM on Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), 2015, pp. 733–742] that has a time and space complexity . (3) A classical algorithm for that runs in time time and space. This improves over an algorithm of [Y. Chen, K. Chung, and C. Lai, Quantum Inf. Comput., 18 (2018), pp. 285–306] that has the same space complexity. The time complexity of our classical and quantum algorithms are obtained using a known upper bound on a quantity related to the lattice kissing number, which is . We conjecture that for most lattices this quantity is a . Assuming that this is the case, our classical algorithm runs in time , our quantum algorithm runs in time , and our quantum algorithm in a QRAM model runs in time . As a direct application of our result, using the reduction in [L. Ducas, Des. Codes. Cryptogr., 92 (2024), pp. 909–916], we obtain a provable quantum algorithm for the lattice isomorphism problem in the case of the trivial lattice (LIP) that runs in time .

  abstract     = {Abstract. In 1979, Hylland and Zeckhauser [J. Polit. Econ., 87 (1979), pp. 293–314] gave a simple and general mechanism for a one-sided matching market, given cardinal utilities of agents over goods. They use the power of a pricing mechanism, which endows their mechanism with several desirable properties—it produces an allocation that is Pareto optimal and envy free, and the mechanism is incentive compatible in the large. It therefore provides an attractive, off-the-shelf method for running an application involving such a market. With matching markets becoming ever more prevalent and impactful, it is imperative to characterize the computational complexity of this mechanism. We present the following results: (1) A combinatorial, strongly polynomial time algorithm for the dichotomous case, i.e., utilities, and more generally, when each agent’s utilities come from a bivalued set. (2) An example that has only irrational equilibria; hence this problem is not in PPAD. (3) A proof of membership of the problem in the class FIXP; as a corollary we get that a Hylland–Zeckhauser (HZ) equilibrium can always be expressed via algebraic numbers. For this purpose, we give a new proof of the existence of an HZ equilibrium using Brouwer’s fixed point theorem; the proof of Hylland and Zeckhauser used Kakutani’s fixed point theorem, which is more involved. (4) A proof of membership of the problem of computing an approximate HZ equilibrium in the class PPAD. In subsequent work [T. Chen et al., SODA 2022, SIAM, Philadelphia, pp. 2253–2268], the problem of computing an approximate HZ equilibrium was shown to be PPAD-hard, thereby establishing it to be PPAD-complete. We leave open the (difficult) question of determining if computing an exact HZ equilibrium is FIXP-hard. We also give pointers to the substantial body of work on cardinal-utility matching markets which followed [V. V. Vazirani and M. Yannakakis, LIPIcs. Leibniz Int. Proc.

The open-loop solvability is characterized by the solvability of a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) in infinite horizon and the convexity of the cost functional, and the closed-loop solvability is shown to be equivalent to the open-loop solvability, which, in turn, is equivalent to the existence of a static stabilizing solution to the associated constrained coupled algebra Riccati equations (CAREs). Under the uniform convexity assumption, we obtain the unique solvability of associated CAREs and construct the corresponding closed-loop optimal strategy.

A nonconventional shape optimization approach is introduced to address the identification of an obstacle immersed in a fluid described by the Stokes equation within a larger bounded domain, relying on boundary measurements on the accessible surface. The approach employs tools from shape optimization, utilizing the coupled complex boundary method to transform the overspecified problem into a complex boundary value problem by incorporating a complex Robin boundary condition. This condition is derived by coupling the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions along the accessible boundary. The identification of the obstacle involves optimizing a cost function constructed based on the imaginary part of the solution across the entire domain. The subsequent calculation of the shape gradient of this cost function, rigorously performed via the rearrangement method, enables the iterative solution of the optimization problem using a Sobolev gradient descent algorithm. The feasibility of the method is illustrated through numerical experiments in both two and three spatial dimensions, demonstrating its effectiveness in reconstructing obstacles with pronounced concavities under high-level noise-contaminated data, all without perimeter or volume functional penalization.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For a general entropy-regularized stochastic control problem on an infinite horizon, we prove that a policy iteration algorithm (PIA) converges to an optimal relaxed control. Contrary to the standard stochastic control literature, classical Hölder estimates of value functions do not ensure the convergence of the PIA, due to the added entropy-regularizing term. To circumvent this, we carry out a delicate estimation by moving back and forth between appropriate Hölder and Sobolev spaces. This requires new Sobolev estimates designed specifically for the purpose of policy iteration and a nontrivial technique to contain the entropy growth. Ultimately, we obtain a uniform Hölder bound for the sequence of value functions generated by the PIA, thereby achieving the desired convergence result. Characterization of the optimal value function as the unique solution to an exploratory Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation comes as a by-product.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) theory plays a significant role in formulating multifarious delay-dependent stability criteria for general systems with time delays. However, the existing delay-dependent results in the framework of LKF for delayed directed networks (DDNs) are generally dependent on the number of nodes in the networks, which are inapplicable to networks with a large size due to the computational complexity of exponential growth. For handling this situation, an interesting property of the Kronecker product is discovered and summarized in this work. Then, by constructing the topology-dependent multiple LKF approach and an ameliorative combined switching strategy, a delay-dependent but -independent pinning synchronization criterion is skillfully developed for the addressed switched delayed directed networks, where “-independent” indicates that the synchronization criterion is independent of the number of nodes. With the ameliorative combined switching strategy, different minimum dwell times are assured for each subnetwork, and none of the subnetworks are required to be synchronized in advance. Apart from that, a simple -independent pinning synchronization criterion for nonswitched DNNs is also discussed. Finally, the applicability of the proposed pinning synchronization approach is verified through a simulation example.},

Each -by- matrix admits the CSR expansion that decomposes the matrix into a sum of at most periodic terms after times of powers. In this study, we propose an time algorithm for the CSR expansion, where is the number of nonzero entries in the matrix, which improves the algorithm known for this problem. Our algorithm is based on finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the max-plus matrix. These roots play a similar role to the eigenvalues of the matrix and become the growth rates of the terms in the CSR expansion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods to multiple agents and focus on the proportionality, which is one of the classical fairness notions. Since proportional allocations do not always exist when goods are indivisible, approximate concepts of proportionality have been considered in previous work. Among them, proportionality up to the maximin good (PROPm) has been the best approximate notion of proportionality that can be achieved for all instances [A. Baklanov et al., PROPm allocations of indivisible goods to multiple agents, in Proceedings of the 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021, pp. 24–30]. In this paper, we introduce the notion of proportionality up to the least valued good on average (PROPavg), which is a stronger notion than PROPm, and show that a PROPavg allocation always exists for all instances and can be computed in polynomial time. Our results establish PROPavg as a notable nontrivial fairness notion that can be achieved for all instances. Our proof is constructive and is based on a new technique that generalizes the cut-and-choose protocol and uses a recursive technique.},

We establish that this extremal value is at most if is a tree, if is bipartite and can be made acyclic with the removal of one vertex, if is an even cycle of length at least 6, and if . Moreover, we exhibit an infinite family of obstructions that each induces a different asymptotic behavior for this extremal value.

Minimizing the weight of an edge set satisfying parity constraints is a challenging branch of combinatorial optimization as witnessed by the binary hypergraph chapter of Alexander Schrijver’s book [Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, 2003, Chapter 80]. This area contains relevant graph theory problems including open cases of the Max Cut problem and some multiflow problems. We clarify the interconnections between some of these problems and establish three levels of difficulty. On the one hand, we prove that the Shortest Odd Path problem in undirected graphs without cycles of negative total weight and several related problems are NP-hard, settling a long-standing open question asked by Lovász (Open Problem 27 in Schrijver’s book [Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, 2003]). On the other hand, we provide an algorithm for the closely related and well-studied Minimum-weight Odd -Join problem for nonnegative weights: our algorithm runs in FPT time parameterized by , where is the number of connected components in some efficiently computed minimum-weight -join. If negative weights are also allowed, then finding a minimum-weight odd -join is equivalent to the Minimum-weight Odd -Join problem for arbitrary weights, whose complexity is still only conjectured to be polynomially solvable. The analogous problems for digraphs are also considered.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For a fixed graph , the -Recoloring problem asks whether, given two homomorphisms from a graph to , one homomorphism can be transformed into the other by changing the image of a single vertex in each step and maintaining a homomorphism to throughout. The most general algorithmic result for -Recoloring so far was proposed by Wrochna in 2014, who introduced a topological approach to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for any undirected loopless square-free graph . We show that the topological approach can be used to recover essentially all previous algorithmic results for -Recoloring and that it is applicable also in the more general setting of digraph homomorphisms. In particular, we show that -Recoloring admits a polynomial-time algorithm if (i) is a loopless digraph that does not contain a 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0 and (ii) is a reflexive digraph that contains no triangle of algebraic girth 1 and no 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0. In both cases, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for finding shortest transformations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. MAX NAE-SAT is a natural optimization problem, closely related to its better-known relative MAX SAT. The approximability status of MAX NAE-SAT is almost completely understood if all clauses have the same size for some . We refer to this problem as MAX NAE--SAT. For , it is a slight extension of the celebrated MAX CUT problem. For , it is related to the MAX CUT problem in graphs that can be fractionally covered by triangles. For , it is known that an approximation ratio of , obtained by choosing a random assignment, is optimal, assuming . For every , an approximation ratio of at least can be obtained for MAX NAE--SAT. There was some hope, therefore, that there is also a -approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, where clauses of all sizes are allowed simultaneously. Our main result is that there is no -approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). In fact, even for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE--SAT (i.e., MAX NAE-SAT where all clauses have size 3 or 5), the best approximation ratio that can be achieved, assuming UGC, is at most . Using calculus of variations, we extend the analysis of O’Donnell and Wu for MAX CUT to MAX NAE--SAT. We obtain an optimal algorithm, assuming UGC, for MAX NAE--SAT, slightly improving on previous algorithms. The approximation ratio of the new algorithm is about 0.9089. This gives a full understanding of MAX NAE--SAT for every . Interestingly, the rounding function used by this optimal algorithm is the solution of an integral equation. We complement our theoretical results with some experimental results. We describe an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE--SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8728, and an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE-SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8698. We further conjecture that these are essentially the best approximation ratios that can be achieved for these problems, assuming the UGC. Somewhat surprisingly, the rounding functions used by these approximation algorithms are nonmonotone step functions that assume only the values .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the following variant of the edge-augmentation problem: Given a -edge-connected graph with no loops or multiple edges, find a smallest edge set in the complement whose addition to results in a -edge-connected graph. We establish the following dichotomy for this problem: If the complement of contains a matching covering all vertices of -degree (and possibly more), then the complement also contains a matching whose addition to results in a -edge-connected graph. A smallest matching which augments the minimum degree can be found, in polynomial time, by Edmonds’ matching algorithm, but it need not augment the edge-connectivity. Indeed, it is NP-hard to find a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting edge set, by a result of Tibor Jordán. On the other hand, if the complement of contains no matching covering all vertices of -degree , then the complement has a minimum degree augmenting path system consisting of paths of length 1 or 2. Again we can find such a path system with as few edges as possible by Edmonds’ matching algorithm. We can, in polynomial time, modify it to an edge-connectivity augmenting path system of paths of length 1 or 2 with the same number of edges, and this time it yields a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting set of edges. Combining these results, we conclude that a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting edge set in the complement of a -regular, -edge-connected simple graph has size , where is the number of vertices of , and is the size of a maximum matching in the complement of . Another corollary is that the complement of every simple noncomplete graph with vertices has a set of at most edges whose addition to results in a graph of larger edge-connectivity, with equality holding if and only the complement of is a disjoint union of 3-cycles.},

Defant, Li, Propp, and Young recently resolved two enumerative conjectures of Propp concerning the tilings of regions in the hexagonal grid called benzels using two types of prototiles called stones and bones (with varying constraints on allowed orientations of the tiles). Their primary tool, a bijection called compression that converts certain -ribbon tilings to -ribbon tilings, allowed them to reduce their problems to the enumeration of dimers (i.e., perfect matchings) of certain graphs. We present a generalized version of compression that no longer relies on the perspective of partitions and skew shapes. Using this strengthened tool, we resolve three more of Propp’s conjectures and recast several others as problems about perfect matchings.},

More precisely, for vertices and of , and an integer , they gave FPT algorithms parameterized by deciding whether there is an -path in whose vertex set contains a subset of elements of of rank . These algorithms are based on the Schwartz–Zippel lemma for polynomial identity testing and thus are randomized, and therefore the existence of a deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem remains open. We present the first deterministic FPT algorithm that solves the problem in frameworks whose underlying graph is planar. While the running time of our algorithm is worse than the running times of the recent randomized algorithms, our algorithm works on more general classes of matroids. In particular, this is the first FPT algorithm for the case when matroid is represented over rationals. We complement this result by proving that if the input matroids are given by their independence oracles, then there is no algorithm solving the problem with oracle queries. Furthermore, this computational lower bound holds even if the input graphs are planar graphs of treewidth at most two.},

We introduce a generalized setting where the cake is represented by an arbitrary undirected graph, which allows us to model the division of road networks. Unlike in the interval setting, common fairness criteria such as proportionality cannot always be satisfied in graphical cake cutting if each agent must receive a connected subgraph. We determine the optimal approximation of proportionality that can be obtained for any number of agents with additive valuations, and exhibit a tight guarantee for each graph in the case of two agents. We also study several variants and extensions, including when more than one connected piece per agent is allowed as well as when the item to be divided is undesirable.},

As soon as a finite-dimensional set of possible yield curves is chosen, one likes to estimate the dynamic behavior of the yield curve evolution from data. The estimated model should be free of arbitrage which is known to result in some drift condition. If the yield curve evolution is modelled by a diffusion, then this leaves the diffusion coefficient open for estimation. From a practical perspective, this requires that the chosen set of possible yield curves is compatible with any obtained diffusion coefficient. In this paper, we show that this compatibility enforces an affine geometry of the set of possible yield curves.},

The results theoretically illustrate that, rather than continuous-time contracts or a bunch of discrete-time contracts, a single once-for-all reinsurance contract is preferred. Moreover, the Stackelberg game turns out to be centering on the signing time of the single contract. The insurer signs the contract if the premium rate is lower than a time-dependent threshold and the reinsurer designs a premium that triggers the signing of the contract at his preferred time. Further, we find that reinsurance preference, discount, and reversion have a decreasing dominance in the reinsurer’s decision-making, which is not seen for the insurer.},

At the mathematical level, this leads to a natural decomposition of the infinitesimal generator describing the evolution of the limit order book into two operators: the generator of the order flow and a clearing operator. This decomposition provides a flexible and modular framework for modeling and simulating order book dynamics and studying various scaling limits of discrete order book models. We show that our framework includes previous models as special cases and yields insights into the interplay between order flow and price dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Time inconsistency (TIC) often arises in multiperiod decision-making through the encoding of more realistic human preferences as objectives; TIC describes a situation in which a plan, consisting of current and future actions, that is optimal today may no longer be optimal in the future. The subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) solution is well-known to resolve such TIC, backed by evidence from behavioral economics and stochastic control literature. Motivated by TIC proliferation and SPE desirability in handling TIC, this paper establishes a subgame perfect equilibrium reinforcement learning (SPERL) framework to search for an SPE solution for TIC problems. We propose a new class of algorithms, called extended backward policy iteration (EBPI), that solves SPERL and concurrently addresses two algorithmic challenges in TIC-RL: the nonexistence of natural recursive relationships between value functions at different time points and the questionable applicability of standard policy iteration algorithms due to unprovable policy improvement theorems. To demonstrate the practical usage of EBPI as a training framework, we adopt standard RL sample-based methods and derive two EBPI-based training algorithms. We examine our derived training frameworks on a mean-variance portfolio selection problem and evaluate some performance metrics including convergence and model identifiability.},

In addition to the usual setting considered in mathematical finance, we also consider an investor who is informed about the risky asset’s price changes with a delay. When the stock increments are independent, identically distributed, and follow a normal distribution, we compute explicitly the value of the problem and the corresponding optimal hedging strategy in a discrete- and a continuous-time setting. In discrete time, our approach is based on duality theory and tools from linear algebra which are related to banded matrices and Toeplitz matrices. Next, we study an analogous continuous-time model where it is possible to trade at fixed equally spaced times. In this model, we compute the scaling limit for both the trading strategy and the achieved value as the frequency of the trading events increases. Finally, we prove that this scaling limit coincides with the continuous-time hedging problem.},

Previous Retinex-based methods simultaneously estimate illumination and reflectance, complicating model design and potentially impacting image enhancement due to flawed prior assumptions. In this paper, we explore the physical basis of low-light image enhancement, focusing on contrast, saturation, and brightness, and propose an adaptive contrast-saturation (ConSat) model. Our ConSat innovation simplifies model design by focusing solely on a brightness enhancement function, allowing for precise image brightness control while keeping colors natural and realistic. We design a new saturation metric that assesses pixel dispersion from the mean of RGB channels, accurately depicting exposure variations across the image. On this basis, we propose a smart contrast stretching function that adapts contrast adjustments to enhance images under varying light. It boosts contrast in dark, low-saturation areas to clarify details and textures, while curbing it in bright, high-saturation areas to prevent overexposure and color distortion. Finally, we employ a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoiser to achieve satisfactory visual appeal. Numerical experiments show that our ConSat is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in brightness improvement, noise removal, and artifact elimination.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article introduces a novel approach to learning monotone neural networks (NNs) through a newly defined penalization loss. The proposed method is particularly effective in solving classes of variational problems, specifically monotone inclusion problems, commonly encountered in image processing tasks. The forward-backward-forward (FBF) algorithm is employed to address these problems, offering a solution even when the Lipschitz constant of the NN is unknown. Notably, the FBF algorithm provides convergence guarantees under the condition that the learned operator is monotone. Building on plug-and-play methodologies, our objective is to apply these newly learned operators to solving nonlinear inverse problems. To achieve this, we initially formulate the problem as a variational inclusion problem. Subsequently, we train a monotone NN to approximate an operator that may not inherently be monotone. Leveraging the FBF algorithm, we then show simulation examples where the nonlinear inverse problem is successfully solved.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Homogeneous diffusion inpainting can reconstruct missing image areas with high quality from a sparse subset of known pixels, provided that their location as well as their gray or color values are well optimized. This property is exploited in inpainting-based image compression, which is a promising alternative to classical transform-based codecs such as JPEG and JPEG2000. However, optimizing the inpainting data is a challenging task. Current approaches are either fairly slow or do not produce high quality results. As a remedy we propose fast spatial and tonal optimization algorithms for homogeneous diffusion inpainting that efficiently utilize GPU parallelism, with a careful adaptation of some of the most successful numerical concepts. We propose a densification strategy using ideas from error-map dithering combined with a Delaunay triangulation for the spatial optimization. For the tonal optimization we design a domain decomposition solver that solves the corresponding normal equations in a matrix-free fashion and supplement it with a Voronoi-based initialization strategy. With our proposed methods we are able to generate high quality inpainting masks for homogeneous diffusion and optimized tonal values in a runtime that outperforms prior state-of-the-art by a wide margin.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns diffraction-tomographic reconstruction of an object characterized by its scattering potential. We establish a rigorous generalization of the Fourier diffraction theorem in arbitrary dimension, giving a precise relation in the Fourier domain between measurements of the scattered wave and reconstructions of the scattering potential. With this theorem at hand, Fourier coverages for different experimental setups are investigated taking into account parameters such as object orientation, direction of incidence, and frequency of illumination. Allowing for simultaneous and discontinuous variation of these parameters, a general filtered backpropagation formula is derived resulting in an explicit approximation of the scattering potential for a large class of experimental setups.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multilayer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC) is a powerful technique for obtaining parsimonious representations of signals in machine learning applications. However, achieving maximum parsimony without sacrificing data fidelity requires learning a dictionary from data, resulting in the nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem of multilayer convolutional dictionary learning (ML-CDL). Existing ML-CDL solvers derived from traditional dictionary learning employ the convex function as the sparsity-inducing function to promote convergence; nevertheless, analyzing the convergence of candidate alternate optimization schemes is still challenging. In this paper, we reformulate the ML-CDL problem by replacing the convolution with the Hadamard product to reduce computational complexity, and to achieve this without destroying the consistency between the variables in the time and frequency domains, additional constraints are introduced to the reformulated problem. We also modify a forward-backward splitting algorithm to solve the reformulated ML-CDL problem using simultaneous coefficients and dictionary element updates across all layers. In contrast, these variables are updated alternately in the previous approaches. The proposed algorithm includes a parameter adaptation scheme to improve optimization performance and ensure convergence. In numerical simulations, the proposed method outperforms existing methods by achieving convergence in fewer iterations and generating a smaller final functional value. The high quality of recovered images demonstrates the applicability of multilayer sparse representation to image reconstruction.},

Finding a transformation between two unknown probability distributions from finite samples is crucial for modeling complex data distributions and performing tasks such as sample generation, domain adaptation, and statistical inference. One powerful framework for such transformations is normalizing flow, which transforms an unknown distribution into a standard normal distribution using an invertible network. In this paper, we introduce a novel model called SyMOT-Flow, which trains an invertible transformation by minimizing the symmetric maximum mean discrepancy between samples from two unknown distributions, and an optimal transport cost is incorporated as regularization to obtain a short-distance and interpretable transformation. The resulting transformation leads to more stable and accurate sample generation. Several theoretical results are established for the proposed model, and its effectiveness is validated with illustrative low-dimensional examples as well as high-dimensional bimodality medical image generation through the forward and reverse flows.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a novel model for decomposing grayscale images into three distinct components: the structural part, representing sharp boundaries and regions with strong light-to-dark transitions; the smooth part, capturing soft shadows and shades; and the oscillatory part, characterizing textures and noise. To capture the homogeneous structures, we introduce a combination of -gradient and curvature regularization on level lines. This new regularization term enforces strong sparsity on the image gradient while reducing the undesirable staircase effects as well as preserving the geometry of contours. For the smoothly varying component, we utilize the -norm of the Laplacian that favors isotropic smoothness. To capture the oscillation, we use the inverse Sobolev seminorm. To solve the associated minimization problem, we design an efficient operator-splitting algorithm. Our algorithm effectively addresses the challenging nonconvex nonsmooth problem by separating it into subproblems. Each subproblem can be solved either directly using closed-form solutions or efficiently using the fast Fourier transform. We provide systematic experiments, including ablation and comparison studies, to analyze our model’s behaviors and demonstrate its effectiveness as well as efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Interactive segmentation allows users to provide meaningful input to guide the segmentation process. However, an important problem in interactive segmentation lies in determining how to incorporate minimal yet meaningful user guidance into the segmentation model. In this paper, we propose the quasi-conformal interactive segmentation (QIS) model, which incorporates user input in the form of positive and negative clicks. Users mark a few pixels belonging to the object region as positive clicks, indicating that the segmentation model should include a region around these clicks. Conversely, negative clicks are provided on pixels belonging to the background, instructing the model to exclude the region near these clicks from the segmentation mask. By solving our proposed theoretical supported model, the segmentation mask is obtained by deforming a template mask with the same topology as the object of interest using a quasi-conformal mapping. This approach makes each user input effectively used and helps to avoid topological errors in the segmentation results. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed model for its ability to include or exclude regions of interest or disinterest based on the user’s indication. To evaluate the performance of QIS, we conduct experiments on synthesized images, medical images, and natural images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.},

This paper focuses on the convergence of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving linearly constrained optimization problems whose objective function is the sum of one weakly convex and two strongly convex functions. Many applications in image denoising and machine learning fields with a sparsity-driven regularization term can be approximated unbiasedly by weakly convex functions. Our new theoretical results provide convergence guarantees of the direct extension of ADMM (E-ADMM) without Lipschitz continuity of the gradient and Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property, and establish the worst-case convergence rate in the nonergodic sense. Under further conditions such as Lipschitz continuity and nonsingularity, we derive the global linear rate of convergence. The numerical results on tensor robust principal component analysis and generalized elastic net regression illustrate that E-ADMM is efficient compared with some popular methods such as the difference-of-convex approach and accelerated proximal gradient descent.},

In this work, we analyze a new data-driven regularized stochastic gradient descent for the efficient numerical solution of a class of nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. At each step of the iteration, the method randomly selects one equation from the nonlinear system combined with a corresponding equation from the learned system based on training data to obtain a stochastic estimate of the gradient and then performs a descent step with the estimated gradient. We prove the regularizing property of this method under the tangential cone condition and a priori parameter choice and then derive the convergence rates under the additional source condition and range invariance conditions.

Based on the linearized problem, a reconstruction algorithm is proposed aiming at the recovery of the Fourier modes of the potential function and the efficiency is verified by several numerical examples.},

To fully exploit the advantage of adapting the metric, we develop a new efficient resolvent calculus for a low-rank perturbed standard metric, which accounts exactly for quasi-Newton metrics. Moreover, we prove the convergence of our algorithms, including linear convergence rates in case one of the two considered operators is strongly monotone. As a by-product of our general monotone inclusion framework, we introduce two variants of the quasi-Newton primal-dual hybrid gradient method (PDHG) for solving saddle point problems.

Our approach follows the widely used framework of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) reconstruction with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Existing methods are based on an implicit assumption of spatially invariant isotropic Gaussian noise. However, this assumption is violated in practice in applications such as single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). To address this issue, we propose to introduce an explicit localization noise model that decouples shape modeling with the GMM from noise handling. We use this model for multiview point cloud registration by designing an EM algorithm that considers noise-free data as a latent variable, with closed-form solutions at each EM step. The first advantage of our approach is to handle spatially varying and anisotropic Gaussian noise. The second advantage is to leverage the explicit noise model to impose prior knowledge about the noise that may be available from physical sensors. We show on various simulated data that our noise handling strategy improves significantly the robustness to high levels of anisotropic noise. We also demonstrate the performance of our method on real SMLM data.},

Numerous techniques have been developed to extend the application of total variation regularization in restoring multispectral images, for example, based on channel coupling and adaptive total variation regularization. The primary contribution of this paper is to propose and develop a new multispectral total variation regularization in a generalized opponent transformation domain instead of the original multispectral image domain. Here, opponent transformations for multispectral images are generalized from a well-known opponent transformation for color images. We will explore the properties of generalized opponent transformation total variation (GOTTV) regularization and the corresponding optimization method for multispectral image restoration. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed GOTTV method, we provide numerical examples that showcase its superior performance compared to existing multispectral image total variation methods, using criteria such as mean peak signal-to-noise ratio and mean structural similarity index.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Blind image deblurring is one of the most critical issues in digital image processing. The main goal of blind image deblurring is to estimate the blur kernel and the intermediate image with a blurry image as input. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for blind image deblurring based on the image smoothing priors. We notice that the salient edge is significant in estimating the blur kernel. If we can find a strategy that can preserve the salient edges of images and smooth out unnecessary details in the deblurring process, the estimated blur kernel will be more accurate. According to this observation, we draw on the experience of image smoothing and propose a new model based on the smoothing priors. For binary images, we extend our model by considering binary constraints. We also extend our method to the nonuniform deblurring problem. Numerically, we use the half-quadratic splitting method to minimize the optimization problem. We also propose a new template-based interpolated algorithm to solve the minimization problem. In the experiment part, we test our method on various datasets to show its effectiveness. Compared with other related methods, our method can estimate blur kernels more accurately and generate fewer artifacts.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recently, the problem of one-bit tensor completion (1BTC) has garnered increasing attention and has been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally. However, prior works heavily relied on the precise knowledge on the distribution of the dither (i.e., the noise prior to one-bit quantization), which is not applicable to applications that involve unknown prequantization noise. The main goal of this paper is to address this limitation and develop a 1BTC method robust to both noise and corruption. Within the framework of tensor SVD, we demonstrate the robustness by studying the following two settings: (i) 1BTC under sub-Gaussian noises, and (ii) a more challenging scenario where sparse corruptions (besides sub-Gaussian noise) also are present. Built upon a novel usage of an -loss function in 1BTC, we propose regularized Lasso for the first setting and a constrained Lasso for the second setting, and both recovery programs are accompanied by theoretical recovery guarantees. We establish nearly matching minimax lower bounds for both settings with unquantized observations, which demonstrates that our recovery methods are near-optimal and the proposed quantization scheme only induces minor information loss. Moreover, we propose optimization algorithms and conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to validate our theory and the robustness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by a class of nonlinear imaging inverse problems, for instance, multispectral computed tomography (MSCT), this paper studies the convergence theory of the nonlinear Kaczmarz method (NKM) for solving the system of nonlinear equations with componentwise convex mapping, namely, the function corresponding to each equation being convex. Such kind of nonlinear mapping may not satisfy the commonly used componentwise tangential cone condition (TCC). For this purpose, we propose a novel condition named relative gradient discrepancy condition (RGDC) and make use of it to prove the convergence and even the convergence rate of the NKM with several general index selection strategies, where these strategies include the cyclic strategy and the maximum residual strategy. Particularly, we investigate the application of the NKM for solving nonlinear systems in MSCT image reconstruction. We prove that the nonlinear mappings in this context fulfill the proposed RGDC rather than the componentwise TCC and provide a global convergence of the NKM based on the previously obtained results. Numerical experiments further illustrate the numerical convergence of the NKM for MSCT image reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a unified view of nonlocal methods for single-image denoising, for which BM3D is the most popular representative, that operate by gathering noisy patches together according to their similarities in order to process them collaboratively. Our general estimation framework is based on the minimization of the quadratic risk, which is approximated in two steps, and adapts to photon and electronic noises. Relying on an unbiased risk estimate (URE) for the first step and on “internal adaptation,” a concept borrowed from deep learning theory, for the second, we show that our approach enables one to reinterpret and reconcile previous state-of-the-art nonlocal methods. Within this framework, we propose a novel denoiser called NL-Ridge that exploits linear combinations of patches. While conceptually simpler, we show that NL-Ridge can outperform well-established state-of-the-art single-image denoisers.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cardiac pulsations in the human brain have received recent interest due to their possible role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Further interest stems from their possible application as an endogenous signal source that can be utilized for brain imaging in general. The (pulse-)wave describing the blood flow velocity along an intracranial artery consists of a forward (anterograde) and a backward (retrograde, reflected) part, but measurements of this wave usually consist of a superposition of these components. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for the inverse problem of estimating the pulse wave velocity, as well as the forward and backward components of the pulse wave separately from MRI measurements on intracranial arteries. After a mathematical analysis of this problem, we consider possible reconstruction approaches and derive an alternate direction approach for its solution. The resulting methods provide estimates for anterograde/retrograde wave forms and the pulse wave velocity under specified assumptions on a cerebrovascular model system. Numerical experiments on simulated and experimental data demonstrate the applicability and preliminary in vivo feasibility of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we study the subspace clustering and recovery of multidimensional images. Existing matrix-based/tensor-based subspace clustering methods successfully consider unilateral information (i.e., the similarity between image samples) to cluster samples into subspaces by using low-rank representation. The key issue of the unilateral representation-based methods is that the number of samples in each subspace should be sufficient for subspace representation. In practice, the clustering performance can be degraded when there is only a small number of observed samples in each subspace. To address the problem of insufficient observed samples, we propose to introduce hidden tensor data to supplement an insufficient number of observed samples. We employ both observed samples and hidden tensor data under low-rank constraints so that a new bilateral tensor low-rank representation (BTLRR) in subspace clustering is formulated. We show that a closed-form solution of block-diagonal tensor structure is obtained in subspace clustering of observed samples and hidden tensor data. Also the proposed BTLRR optimization problem can be solved by using the convex relaxation technique and augmented Lagrangian multiplier algorithm. The proposed BTLRR can fully explore the bilateral information of observations, including not only the similarity between samples but also the relationship among features. Extensive numerical results on multidimensional image data clustering and recovery illustrate that the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed bilateral representation are better than those of state-of-the-art methods (e.g., the popular LRR and TLRR methods).},

The sliced-Wasserstein flow is an evolution equation where a probability density evolves in time, advected by a velocity field computed as the average among directions in the unit sphere of the optimal transport displacements from its one-dimensional projections to the projections of a fixed target measure. This flow happens to be the gradient flow in the usual Wasserstein space of the squared sliced-Wasserstein distance to the target. We consider the question whether in long-time the flow converges to the target (providing a positive result when the target is Gaussian) and the question of the long-time limit of the flow map obtained by following the trajectories of each particle. We prove that this limit is, in general, not the optimal transport map from the starting measure to the target. Both questions come from the folklore about sliced-Wasserstein and had never been properly treated.},

A uniform estimate with respect to the Knudsen number is established globally in time, which eventually leads to the global existence of solutions to the one-species Vlasov–Maxwell–Boltzmann system and hydrodynamic limit to the incompressible Navier–Stokes–Fourier–Maxwell system.

To analyze this nonlocal boundary value problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness, and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data.

Uniqueness of these solutions is relevant from both a theoretical and an algorithmic point of view and has recently emerged as a necessary condition for asymptotic results in the context of statistical and entropic optimal transport. In this work, we challenge the common perception that uniqueness in continuous settings is reliant on the connectedness of the support of at least one of the involved measures, and we provide mild sufficient conditions for uniqueness even when both measures have disconnected support. Since our main finding builds upon the uniqueness of Kantorovich potentials on connected components, we revisit the corresponding arguments and provide generalizations of well-known results. To this end, we introduce the notion of induced regularity and employ it to extend the regularity theory of Kantorovich potentials advanced by Gangbo and McCann [Acta Math., 177 (1996), pp. 113–161] to more general cost functions in and to geodesic spaces.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional isothermal compressible Navier–Stokes equation with vacuum and degenerate viscosity that depends on the density. Under some assumptions on the initial data that can be arbitrarily large, a global existence-uniqueness result on the strong solution with far field vacuum is derived. The interaction between the degenerate viscosity and the pressure is the main issue. A series of new global a priori estimates for both the velocity and the effective velocity allow that the adiabatic index can be equal to 1 which is exactly the isothermal case. This work can be viewed as the first result on the global existence and uniqueness of a large solution to the isothermal case with degenerate viscosity and vacuum.},

Both the total initial energy and the initial mass are allowed to be unbounded, and the doping profile is allowed to be of large variation. This is achieved by adapting a class of degenerate density-dependent viscosity terms, so that a rigorous proof of the inviscid limit of global weak solutions of the Navier–Stokes–Poisson equations with the density-dependent viscosity terms to the corresponding global solutions of the Euler–Poisson equations for plasma with doping profile can be established. New difficulties arise when tackling the nonzero varied doping profile, which have been overcome by establishing some novel estimates for the electric field terms so that the neutrality assumption on the initial data is avoided. In particular, we prove that no concentration is formed in the inviscid limit for the finite relative-energy solutions of the compressible Euler–Poisson equations with large doping profiles in plasma physics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Paterson–Stockmeyer method is an evaluation scheme for matrix polynomials with scalar coefficients that arise in many state-of-the-art algorithms based on polynomial or rational approximation, for example, those for computing transcendental matrix functions. We derive a mixed-precision version of the Paterson–Stockmeyer method that is particularly useful for evaluating matrix polynomials with scalar coefficients of decaying magnitude. The new method is mainly of interest in the arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and it is attractive for high-precision computations. The key idea is to perform computations on data of small magnitude in low precision, and rounding error analysis is provided for the use of precisions lower than the working precision. We focus on the evaluation of the Taylor approximants of the matrix exponential and show the applicability of our method to the existing scaling and squaring algorithms. We also demonstrate through experiments the general applicability of our method to other problems, such as computing the polynomials from the Padé approximant of the matrix exponential and the Taylor approximant of the matrix cosine. Numerical experiments show our mixed-precision Paterson–Stockmeyer algorithms can be more efficient than its fixed-precision counterpart while delivering the same level of accuracy.

The CUR decomposition approximates a matrix using a subset of columns and rows of the matrix. When the number of columns and rows is the same, the CUR decomposition can become unstable and less accurate due to the presence of the matrix inverse in the core matrix. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the CUR decomposition can be implemented in a numerically stable manner and illustrate that oversampling, which increases the number of either columns or rows in the CUR decomposition, can enhance its accuracy and stability. Additionally, this work devises an algorithm for oversampling motivated by the theory of the CUR decomposition and the cosine-sine decomposition, whose competitiveness is illustrated through experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Methods and algorithms that work with data on nonlinear manifolds are collectively summarized under the term “Riemannian computing.&quot; In practice, curvature can be a key limiting factor for the performance of Riemannian computing methods. Yet curvature can also be a powerful tool in the theoretical analysis of Riemannian algorithms. In this work, we investigate the sectional curvature of the Stiefel and Grassmann manifold. On the Grassmannian, tight curvature bounds have been known since the late 1960s. On the Stiefel manifold under the canonical metric, it was believed that the sectional curvature does not exceed 5/4. Under the Euclidean metric, the maximum was conjectured to be at 1. For both manifolds, the sectional curvature is given by the Frobenius norm of certain structured commutator brackets of skew-symmetric matrices. We provide refined inequalities for such terms and pay special attention to the maximizers of the curvature bounds. In this way, we prove for the Stiefel manifold that the global bounds of 5/4 (canonical metric) and 1 (Euclidean metric) hold indeed. With this addition, a complete account of the curvature bounds in all admissible dimensions is obtained. We observe that “high curvature means low-rank&quot;; more precisely, for the Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds under the canonical metric, the global curvature maximum is attained at tangent plane sections that are spanned by rank-two matrices, while the extreme curvature cases of the Euclidean Stiefel manifold occur for rank-one matrices.

Then we generalize this approach to the block and normalization lagging variants and prove the same order of accuracy. For the Cholesky-based block variant, we investigate the causes of instability and suggest a more stable ICWY algorithm.

As such, this method augments an unprojected Krylov subspace. Furthermore, it combines randomized sketching and deflated restarting in a way that avoids orthogononalizing a full Krylov basis. We call this new method GMRES-SDR (sketched deflated restarting). With this new method, we provide new theory which initially characterizes unaugmented sketched GMRES as a projection method for which the projectors involve the sketching operator. We demonstrate that sketched GMRES and its sibling method sketched FOM are an MR/OR pairing, just like GMRES and FOM. We furthermore obtain residual convergence estimates. Building on this, we characterize GMRES-SDR also in terms of sketching-based projectors. Compression of the augmented Krylov subspace for recycling is performed using a sketched version of harmonic Ritz vectors.

We show that one must be extremely careful when discretizing nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Using examples from the NLEVP collection, we demonstrate that discretization can lead to several issues, including (1) introduction of spurious eigenvalues, (2) omission of spectra, (3) severe ill-conditioning, and (4) emergence of ghost essential spectra. While many eigensolvers are available for solving finite matrix nonlinear eigenvalue problems, we propose InfBeyn, a solver for general holomorphic infinite-dimensional nonlinear eigenvalue problems that circumvents these discretization issues. We prove that InfBeyn is stable and converges. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm that computes the problem’s pseudospectra with explicit error control, enabling verification of computed spectra.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new projected Rayleigh quotient iteration aimed at improving the convergence behavior of classic Rayleigh quotient iteration (RQI) by incorporating approximate information about the target eigenvector at each step. While classic RQI exhibits local cubic convergence for Hermitian matrices, its global behavior can be unpredictable, whereby it may converge to an eigenvalue far away from the target, even when started with accurate initial conditions. This problem is exacerbated when the eigenvalues are closely spaced. The key idea of the new algorithm is at each step to add a complex-valued projection to the original matrix (that depends on the current eigenvector approximation), such that the unwanted eigenvalues are lifted into the complex plane while the target stays close to the real line, thereby increasing the spacing between the target eigenvalue and the rest of the spectrum. Making better use of the eigenvector approximation leads to more robust convergence behavior, and the new method converges reliably to the correct target eigenpair for a significantly wider range of initial vectors than does classic RQI. We prove that the method converges locally cubically, and we present several numerical examples demonstrating the improved global convergence behavior. In particular, we apply it to compute eigenvalues in a band-gap spectrum of a Sturm–Liouville operator used to model photonic crystal fibers, where the target and unwanted eigenvalues are closely spaced. The examples show that the new method converges to the desired eigenpair even when the eigenvalue spacing is very small, often succeeding when classic RQI fails.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) is a technique in data analysis and machine learning that approximates a symmetric matrix with a product of a nonnegative, low-rank matrix and its transpose. To design faster and more scalable algorithms for SymNMF, we develop two randomized algorithms for its computation. The first algorithm uses randomized matrix sketching to compute an initial low-rank approximation to the input matrix and proceeds to rapidly compute a SymNMF of the approximation. The second algorithm uses randomized leverage score sampling to approximately solve constrained least squares problems. Many successful methods for SymNMF rely on (approximately) solving sequences of constrained least squares problems. We prove theoretically that leverage score sampling can approximately solve nonnegative least squares problems to a chosen accuracy with high probability. Additionally, we prove sampling complexity results for previously proposed hybrid sampling techniques which deterministically include high leverage score rows. This hybrid scheme is crucial for obtaining speedups in practice. Finally, we demonstrate that both methods work well in practice by applying them to graph clustering tasks on large real world data sets. These experiments show that our methods approximately maintain solution quality and achieve significant speedups for both large dense and large sparse problems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem (GOPP) plays a fundamental role in several scientific disciplines including statistics, imaging science, and computer vision. Despite its tremendous practical importance, it is generally an NP-hard problem to find the least squares estimator. We study the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and an iterative method named generalized power method (GPM) to find the least squares estimator, and we investigate the performance under a signal-plus-noise model. We show that the SDR recovers the least squares estimator exactly, and moreover, the generalized power method with a proper initialization converges linearly to the global minimizer to the SDR, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is large. The main technique follows from showing the nonlinear mapping involved in the GPM is essentially a local contraction mapping, and then applying the well-known Banach fixed-point theorem finishes the proof. In addition, we analyze the low-rank factorization algorithm and show the corresponding optimization landscape is free of spurious local minimizers under nearly identical conditions that enable the success of the SDR approach. The highlight of our work is that the theoretical guarantees are purely algebraic and do not assume any statistical priors of the additive adversaries, and thus it applies to various interesting settings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The fast multipole method (FMM) is a powerful method for accelerating some kernel matrix-vector multiplications. In this paper, we show an intuitive matrix version of the FMM in two dimensions via degenerate Taylor series expansions and, furthermore, give a simple stabilization strategy to balance relevant low-rank factors so that the factors and some translation operators satisfy certain norm bounds. Based on these, we provide the long-overdue backward stability analysis for the FMM. The matrix version FMM translates the original FMM terminology into simple matrix language with the aim of being more accessible to nonexperts and more convenient to perform backward stability analysis. The stabilization strategy leads to entrywise backward errors that depend only logarithmically on the matrix size, which shows the superior stability benefit of the FMM on top of its efficiency advantage as compared with usual dense matrix-vector multiplications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we develop a novel multilevel Tau matrix-based preconditioned method for a class of nonsymmetric multilevel Toeplitz systems. This method not only accounts for but also improves upon an ideal preconditioner pioneered by Pestana [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 40 (2019), pp. 870–887]. The ideal preconditioning approach was primarily examined numerically in that study, and an effective implementation was not included. To address these issues, we first rigorously show in this study that this ideal preconditioner can indeed achieve optimal convergence when employing the minimal residual (MINRES) method, with a convergence rate that is independent of the mesh size. Then, building on this preconditioner, we develop a practical and optimal preconditioned MINRES method. To further illustrate its applicability and develop a fast implementation strategy, we consider solving Riemann–Liouville fractional diffusion equations as an application. Specifically, following standard discretization on the equation, the resultant linear system is a nonsymmetric multilevel Toeplitz system, affirming the applicability of our preconditioning method. Through a simple symmetrization strategy, we transform the original linear system into a symmetric multilevel Hankel system. Subsequently, we propose a symmetric positive definite multilevel Tau preconditioner for the symmetrized system, which can be efficiently implemented using discrete sine transforms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that mesh-independent convergence can be achieved. In particular, we prove that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are bounded within disjoint intervals containing , without any outliers. Numerical examples are provided to critically discuss the results, showcase the spectral distribution, and support the efficacy of our preconditioning strategy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Johnson–Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction in modern algorithm design. The lemma states that any set of high-dimensional points in a Euclidean space can be projected into lower dimensions while approximately preserving pairwise Euclidean distances. Random matrices satisfying this lemma are called JL transforms (JLTs). Inspired by existing -hashing JLTs with exactly nonzero elements on each column, the present work introduces an ensemble of sparse matrices encompassing so-called -hashing-like matrices whose expected number of nonzero elements on each column is . The independence of the sub-Gaussian entries of these matrices and the knowledge of their exact distribution play an important role in their analyses. Using properties of independent sub-Gaussian random variables, these matrices are demonstrated to be JLTs, and their smallest nontrivial singular values and largest singular values are estimated nonasymptotically using a technique from geometric functional analysis. As the dimensions of the matrix grow to infinity, these singular values are proved to converge almost surely to fixed quantities (by using the universal Bai–Yin law) and in distribution to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble Tracy–Widom law after proper rescalings. Understanding the behaviors of extreme singular values is important in general because they are often used to define a measure of stability of matrix algorithms. For example, JLTs were recently used in derivative-free optimization algorithmic frameworks to select random subspaces in which are constructed random models or poll directions to achieve scalability, and hence estimating their smallest singular value in particular helps determine the dimension of these subspaces.},

One of their main features is their high degree of parallelism that makes them extremely effective for high performance computing. One of their main drawbacks, however, is that the set-up cost grows very quickly with the density, so that it is practically impossible to increase their accuracy by just allowing more entries. In this work, we consider approximate inverses in factored form and show that nesting more factors can greatly enhance their effectiveness at a reasonable computational cost. We additionally provide strategies and theoretical insights aimed at mitigating the computational burden associated with the triple matrix product required in the initial stage of nesting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments arising from a broad spectrum of real-world applications.},

We provide novel theoretical evidence, supported by extensive experimental evaluation, that with high probability, the smallest singular value of a stochastically rounded matrix is well bounded away from zero—regardless of how close is to being rank-deficient and even if is rank-deficient. In other words, stochastic rounding implicitly regularizes tall-and-thin matrices so that the rounded version has full column rank.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Block classical Gram–Schmidt (BCGS) is commonly used for orthogonalizing a set of vectors in distributed computing environments due to its favorable communication properties relative to other orthogonalization approaches, such as modified Gram–Schmidt or Householder. However, it is known that BCGS (as well as recently developed low-synchronization variants of BCGS) can suffer from a significant loss of orthogonality in finite-precision arithmetic, which can contribute to instability and inaccurate solutions in downstream applications such as -step Krylov subspace methods. A common solution to improve the orthogonality among the vectors is reorthogonalization. Focusing on the “Pythagorean” variant of BCGS, introduced in [E. Carson, K. Lund, and M. Rozložník, SIAM J.

These variants feature favorable communication properties, with asymptotically two synchronization points per block column, as well as an improved bound on the loss of orthogonality. Our bounds are derived in a general fashion to additionally allow for the analysis of mixed-precision variants.

Theoretical results and extensive numerical experiments suggest that H-CMRH exhibits comparable performance to the established hybrid GMRES method in terms of stabilizing semiconvergence, but H-CMRH does not require any inner products, and requires less work and storage per iteration.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The recent decade has witnessed a surge of research in modelling and computing from two-way data (matrices) to multiway data (tensors). However, there is a drastic phase transition for most tensor computation problems when the order of a tensor increases from two to three: Most tensor problems are NP-hard while those for matrices are easy. It triggers a question on where exactly the transition occurs. The paper aims to study the kind of question for the spectral norm and the nuclear norm. Although computing the spectral norm for a general tensor is NP-hard, we show that it can be computed using a number of arithmetic operations which is polynomial in and if is fixed. In other words, the best rank-one approximation of a general tensor can be computed in polynomial time for fixed . Under an assumption of a polynomial-time algorithm for quadratic feasibility problem in the bit complexity, both the spectral norm and the nuclear norm of a general tensor can be computed in polynomial time in the bit complexity for fixed . While these polynomial-time methods are not currently implementable in practice, we propose fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for the spectral norm based on polytope approximation and for the nuclear norm with further help of duality theory and semidefinite optimization. Numerical experiments show that our FPTAS can compute these tensor norms for small but large and . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to compute the nuclear norm of general asymmetric tensors. Both polynomial-time algorithms and FPTAS can be extended to higher-order tensors as well.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for approximating multivariate traces, i.e., the traces of matrix products. Our research is motivated by the extensive utility of multivariate traces in elucidating spectral characteristics of matrices, as well as by recent advancements in leveraging quantum computing for faster numerical linear algebra. Central to our approach is a direct translation of a multivariate trace formula into a quantum circuit, achieved through a sequence of low-level circuit construction operations. To facilitate this translation, we introduce quantum matrix states linear algebra (qMSLA), a framework tailored for the efficient generation of state preparation circuits via primitive matrix algebra operations. Our algorithm relies on sets of state preparation circuits for input matrices as its primary inputs and yields two state preparation circuits encoding the multivariate trace as output. These circuits are constructed utilizing qMSLA operations, which enact the aforementioned multivariate trace formula. We emphasize that our algorithm’s inputs consist solely of state preparation circuits, eschewing harder to synthesize constructs such as block encodings. Furthermore, our approach operates independently of the availability of specialized hardware like QRAM, underscoring its versatility and practicality.},

First of all, we show that this problem is equivalent to a special rank-1 matrix recovery problem. When the tensor is strongly rank-1 completable, we show that the problem is equivalent to a rank-1 matrix completion problem and it can be solved by an iterative formula. For other cases, we propose both nuclear norm relaxation and moment relaxation methods for solving the resulting rank-1 matrix recovery problem. The nuclear norm relaxation sometimes returns a rank-1 tensor completion, while sometimes it does not. When it fails, we apply the moment hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations to solve the rank-1 matrix recovery problem. The moment hierarchy can always get a rank-1 tensor completion, or detect its nonexistence. Numerical experiments are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of these proposed methods.},

We present analysis for the expected change in the LDA discriminant function if one employs the randomized Kaczmarz solution in lieu of the full data least squares solution that accounts for both the Gaussian modeling assumptions on the data and algorithmic randomness. Our analysis shows how the expected change depends on quantities inherent in the data such as the scaled condition number and Frobenius norm of the input data, how well the linear model fits the data, and choices from the randomized algorithm.

Previous algorithms to compute the signature kernel scale quadratically in terms of the length and number of the sequences. To mitigate this severe computational bottleneck, we develop a random Fourier feature-based acceleration of the signature kernel acting on the inherently non-Euclidean domain of sequences. We show uniform approximation guarantees for the proposed unbiased estimator of the signature kernel, while keeping its computation linear in the sequence length and number. In addition, combined with recent advances on tensor projections, we derive two even more scalable time series features with favorable concentration properties and computational complexity both in time and memory. Our empirical results show that the reduction in computational cost comes at a negligible price in terms of accuracy on moderate size datasets, and it enables one to scale to large datasets up to a million time series.

These infinity entries enable sGW to enforce application-induced constraints on preserving pairwise distance to a certain extent. A numerical solver is proposed for the sGW problem and the effectiveness is demonstrated in various numerical experiments. The high-order constraints in sGW are transferred to constraints on the coupling matrix by solving a minimal vertex cover problem. The transformed problem is solved by the mirror-C descent iteration coupled with the supervised optimal transport solver. In the numerical experiments, we first validate the proposed framework by applying it to matching synthetic datasets and investigating the impact of the model parameters. Additionally, we apply sGW to aligning single-cell RNA sequencing data where the datasets are partially overlapping and only intra-dataset metrics are used. Through comparisons with other Gromov–Wasserstein variants, we demonstrate that sGW offers an additional utility of controlling distance preservation, leading to automatic estimation of overlapping portions of datasets, which brings improved stability and flexibility in data-driven applications.

We show that simple rationales such as “setting the derivative to zero” and “gradients are aligned at optimality” carry over to the Wasserstein space. We deploy our tools to study and solve optimization problems in the setting of distributionally robust optimization and statistical inference.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider kernel-based regularized learning with the help of the random projection technique to ease its computational burden. The random projection approaches we study here include the randomized sketching method and the Nyström approximation method. Current works under the least squares loss demonstrated an optimal learning rate under an appropriate source condition and capacity condition. However, beyond this simplest loss, it seems challenging to appropriately incorporate both conditions due to the unavailability of a closed-form solution. In this work, we consider a sufficiently general class of convex losses which include logistic loss, quantile loss, and hinge loss, for example, and establish the same optimal learning rate as in the least squares case under mild regularity assumptions. Our result also covers the unattainable case where the true function is not in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. To incorporate the source condition, Young’s inequality for operators is used, while to characterize the capacity, Rademacher complexity is adopted. We illustrate the performances of random projection with some numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The method of moments is a classical statistical technique for density estimation that solves a system of moment equations to estimate the parameters of an unknown distribution. A fundamental question critical to understanding identifiability asks how many moment equations are needed to get finitely many solutions and how many solutions there are. We answer this question for classes of Gaussian mixture models using the tools of polyhedral geometry. In addition, we show that a generic Gaussian -mixture model is identifiable from its first moments. Using these results, we present a homotopy algorithm that performs parameter recovery for high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models where the number of paths tracked scales linearly in the dimension.},

The estimator is positive definite by construction, and the Mahalanobis distance minimized to obtain it possesses properties enabling practical computation. We show that our manifold regression multifidelity (MRMF) covariance estimator is a maximum likelihood estimator under a certain error model on manifold tangent space. More broadly, we show that our Riemannian regression framework encompasses existing multifidelity covariance estimators constructed from control variates. We demonstrate via numerical examples that the MRMF estimator can provide significant decreases, up to one order of magnitude, in squared estimation error relative to both single-fidelity and other multifidelity covariance estimators. Furthermore, preservation of positive definiteness ensures that our estimator is compatible with downstream tasks, such as data assimilation and metric learning, in which this property is essential.},

Motivated by problems in shape constrained inference, we also consider structured variants of this problem with additional convex polyhedral constraints. We propose a new cubic regularized Newton method for this problem and present novel worst-case and local computational guarantees for our algorithm. We extend earlier work by Nesterov and Polyak to the case of a self-concordant objective with polyhedral constraints, such as the ones considered herein. We propose a Frank–Wolfe method to solve the cubic regularized Newton subproblem and derive efficient solutions for the linear optimization oracles that may be of independent interest. In the particular case of Gaussian mixtures without shape constraints, we derive bounds on how well the finite mixture problem approximates the infinite-dimensional Kiefer–Wolfowitz maximum likelihood estimator.

This paper expands the analysis of randomized low-rank approximation beyond the Gaussian distribution to four classes of random matrices: (1) independent sub-Gaussian entries, (2) independent sub-Gaussian columns, (3) independent bounded columns, and (4) independent columns with bounded second moment. Using a novel interpretation of the low-rank approximation error involving sample covariance matrices, we provide insight into the requirements of a good random matrix for randomized low-rank approximations. Although our bounds involve unspecified absolute constants (a consequence of underlying nonasymptotic theory of random matrices), they allow for qualitative comparisons across distributions. The analysis offers some details on the minimal number of samples (the number of columns of the random matrix ) and the error in the resulting low-rank approximation. We illustrate our analysis in the context of the randomized subspace iteration method as a representative algorithm for low-rank approximation; however, all the results are broadly applicable to other low-rank approximation techniques. We conclude our discussion with numerical examples using both synthetic and real-world test matrices.},

We prove a representer theorem that states that the solution sets to learning problems posed over these Banach spaces are completely characterized by neural architectures with multivariate nonlinearities. These optimal architectures have skip connections and are tightly connected to orthogonal weight normalization and multi-index models, both of which have received recent interest in the neural network community. Our framework is compatible with a number of classical nonlinearities including the rectified linear unit activation function, the norm activation function, and the radial basis functions found in the theory of thin-plate/polyharmonic splines. We also show that the underlying spaces are special instances of reproducing kernel Banach spaces and variation spaces. Our results shed light on the regularity of functions learned by neural networks trained on data, particularly with multivariate nonlinearities, and provide new theoretical motivation for several architectural choices found in practice.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Diffusion models are a new class of generative models that revolve around the estimation of the score function associated with an SDE. Subsequent to its acquisition, the approximated score function is then harnessed to simulate the corresponding time-reversal process, ultimately enabling the generation of approximate data samples. Despite their evident practical significance these models carry, a notable challenge persists in the form of a lack of comprehensive quantitative results, especially in scenarios involving nonregular scores and estimators. In almost all reported bounds in Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, it is assumed that either the score function or its approximation is Lipschitz uniformly in time. However, this condition is very restrictive in practice or appears to be difficult to establish. To circumvent this issue, previous works mainly focused on establishing convergence bounds in KL for an early stopped version of the diffusion model and a smoothed version of the data distribution or assuming that the data distribution is supported on a compact manifold. These explorations have led to interesting bounds in either Wasserstein or Fortet–Mourier metrics. However, the question remains about the relevance of such an early stopping procedure or compactness conditions, in particular, if there exists a natural and mild condition ensuring explicit and sharp convergence bounds in KL. In this article, we tackle the aforementioned limitations by focusing on score diffusion models with fixed step size stemming from the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck semigroup and its kinetic counterpart. Our study provides a rigorous analysis, yielding simple, improved, and sharp convergence bounds in KL applicable to any data distribution with finite Fisher information with respect to the standard Gaussian distribution.},

Traditional image processing methods employing PDEs offer a multitude of meaningful regularizers along with valuable theoretical foundations for a wide range of image-related tasks. This makes their integration into neural networks a promising avenue. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization approach inspired by the reverse process of PDE-based evolution models. Specifically, we propose inverse evolution layers (IELs), which serve as bad property amplifiers to penalize neural networks of which outputs have undesired characteristics. Using IELs, one can achieve specific regularization objectives and endow neural network outputs with corresponding properties of the PDE models. Our experiments, focusing on semantic segmentation tasks using heat-diffusion IELs, demonstrate their effectiveness in mitigating noisy label effects. Additionally, we develop curve-motion IELs to enforce convex shape regularization in neural network–based segmentation models for preventing the generation of concave outputs. Our results indicate that IELs may offer a potential regularization mechanism for addressing challenges related to noisy labels.},

First, we theoretically derive what is essentially the unique generalization to ReLU GNNs of the well-known He-initialization. Our initialization scheme guarantees that the average scale of network outputs and gradients remains order one at initialization. Second, we prove in finite width vanilla ReLU GNNs that oversmoothing is unavoidable at large depth when using fixed aggregation operators, regardless of initialization. We then prove that using residual aggregation operators, obtained by interpolating a fixed aggregation operator with the identity, provably alleviates oversmoothing at initialization. Finally, we show that the common practice of using residual connections with a fixup-type initialization provably avoids correlation collapse in final layer features at initialization. Through ablation studies, we find that using the correct initialization, residual aggregation operators, and residual connections in the forward pass significantly and reliably speeds up early training dynamics in deep ReLU GNNs on a variety of tasks.},

These new schemes are based on a reformulation of general surface evolution equations, achieved by coupling the original equation with a modified harmonic map heat flow. We demonstrate that our Euler schemes are energy-diminishing, and the proposed BDF2 schemes are energy-stable under a mild assumption on the mesh distortion.

The method has face degrees of freedom associated with multiscale basis functions computed from local Neumann problems driven by discontinuous polynomial spaces on skeletal meshes. The two-level MHM version approximates the multiscale basis using a stabilized finite element method. This work proposes the first numerical analysis for the one- and two-level MHM method applied to the Stokes/Brinkman equations within a new abstract framework relating MHM methods to discrete primal hybrid formulations. As a result, we generalize the two-level MHM method to include general second-level solvers and continuous polynomial interpolation on faces and establish abstract conditions to have those methods well-posed and optimally convergent on natural norms. We apply the abstract setting to analyze the MHM methods using stabilized and stable finite element methods as second-level solvers with (dis)continuous interpolation on faces. Also, we find that the discrete velocity and pressure variables preserve the balance of forces and conservation of mass at the element level. Numerical benchmarks assess theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Efficient simulation of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on general domains requires noise discretization. This paper employs piecewise linear interpolation of noise in a fully discrete finite element approximation of a semilinear stochastic reaction-advection-diffusion equation on a convex polyhedral domain. The Gaussian noise is white in time, spatially correlated, and modeled as a standard cylindrical Wiener process on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This paper provides the first rigorous analysis of the resulting noise discretization error for a general spatial covariance kernel. The kernel is assumed to be defined on a larger regular domain, allowing for sampling by the circulant embedding method. The error bound under mild kernel assumptions requires nontrivial techniques like Hilbert–Schmidt bounds on products of finite element interpolants, entropy numbers of fractional Sobolev space embeddings, and an error bound for interpolants in fractional Sobolev norms. Examples with kernels encountered in applications are illustrated in numerical simulations using the FEniCS finite element software. Key findings include the following: noise interpolation does not introduce additional errors for Matérn kernels in ; there exist kernels that yield dominant interpolation errors; and generating noise on a coarser mesh does not always compromise accuracy.},

A rigorous far-field expansion of these long-range fields identifies low-rank structure in the form of a sum of discrete multipole terms and continuum predictors [J. Braun, T. Hudson, and C. Ortner, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 245 (2022), pp. 1437–1490]. We propose a novel numerical scheme that exploits this low-rank structure to accelerate material defect simulations by minimizing the domain size effects. Our approach iteratively improves the boundary condition, systematically following the asymptotic expansion of the far field. We provide both rigorous error estimates for the method and a range of empirical numerical tests to assess its convergence and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Gaussian process regression is a classical kernel method for function estimation and data interpolation. In large data applications, computational costs can be reduced using low-rank or sparse approximations of the kernel. This paper investigates the effect of such kernel approximations on the interpolation error. We introduce a unified framework to analyze Gaussian process regression under important classes of computational misspecification: Karhunen–Loève expansions that result in low-rank kernel approximations, multiscale wavelet expansions that induce sparsity in the covariance matrix, and finite element representations that induce sparsity in the precision matrix. Our theory also accounts for epistemic misspecification in the choice of kernel parameters.},

For smooth, strongly convex objective functions, we relax the requirements necessary for such a construction. As a result, we are able to prove for Polyak’s ordinary differential equations and for a two-parameter family of Nesterov algorithms rates of convergence that improve on those available in the literature. We analyze the interpretation of Nesterov algorithms as discretizations of the Polyak equation. We show that the algorithms are instances of additive Runge–Kutta integrators and discuss the reasons why most discretizations of the differential equation do not result in optimization algorithms with acceleration. We also introduce a modification of Polyak’s equation and study its convergence properties. Finally, we extend the general framework to the stochastic scenario and consider an application to random algorithms with acceleration for overparameterized models; again we are able to prove convergence rates that improve on those in the literature.},

Additionally, the condition highlights the potential advantage of a specific distance metric for out-of-sample performance, as exemplified in a numerical study on a facility location problem with demand uncertainty. Furthermore, cutting-plane-based algorithms, equipped with a unified scenario generation framework, are proposed for addressing both unbounded support and second-stage dual feasible regions, with a finite convergence proof under less stringent assumptions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies chance-constrained stochastic optimization problems with finite support. It presents an iterative method that solves reduced-size chance-constrained models obtained by partitioning the scenario set. Each reduced problem is constructed to yield a bound on the optimal value of the original problem. We show how to adapt the partitioning of the scenario set so that our adaptive method returns the optimal solution of the original chance-constrained problem in a finite number of iterations. At the heart of the method lie two fundamental operations: refinement and merging. A refinement operation divides a subset of the partition, whereas a merging operation combines a group of subsets into one. We describe how to use these operations to enhance the bound obtained in each step of the method while preserving the small size of the reduced model. Under mild conditions, we prove that, for specific refinement and merge operations, the bound obtained after solving each reduced model strictly improves throughout the iterative process. Our general method allows the seamless integration of various computational enhancements, significantly reducing the computational time required to solve the reduced chance-constrained problems. The method’s efficiency is assessed through numerical experiments on chance-constrained multidimensional knapsack problems. We study the impact of our method’s components and compare its performance against other methods from the recent literature.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A Discrete-Time Linear Complementarity System (DLCS) is a dynamical system in discrete time whose state evolution is governed by linear dynamics in states and algebraic variables that solve a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). The DLCS is the hybrid dynamical system that is the discrete-time counterpart of the well-known Linear Complementarity System (LCS). We derive sufficient conditions for Lyapunov stability of a DLCS when using a quadratic Lyapunov function that depends only on the state variables and a quadratic Lyapunov function that depends both on the state and the algebraic variables. The sufficient conditions require checking the feasibility of a copositive program over nonconvex cones. Our results only assume that the LCP is solvable and do not require the solutions to be unique. We devise a novel, exact cutting plane algorithm for the verification of stability and the computation of the Lyapunov functions. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first exact approach for stability verification of DLCS. A number of numerical examples are presented to illustrate the approach. Though our main object of study in this paper is the DLCS, the proposed algorithm can be readily applied to the stability verification of LCS. In this context, we show the equivalence between the stability of a LCS and the DLCS, resulting from a time-stepping procedure applied to the LCS for all sufficiently small time steps.},

In this work, we show that such sets can be realized as solution sets of systems of finitely many convex quadratic inequalities, and hence are representable via second-order cone programming problems, and are, in particular, spectrahedral. It also follows that these sets are facially exposed, in contrast to earlier constructions. We obtain a lower bound on the minimum number of convex quadratic inequalities needed to represent a closed convex set with prescribed facial dimension signature and show that our bound is tight for some special cases. Finally, we relate the question of finding efficient representations with indecomposability of integer sequences and other topics and discuss a substantial number of open questions.},

Our main contribution is threefold. (i) We consider bilevel VIs with monotone and Lipschitz continuous mappings and devise a single-timescale iteratively regularized extragradient method, named IR-EG. We improve the existing iteration complexity results for addressing both bilevel VI and VI-constrained convex optimization problems. (ii) Under the strong monotonicity of the outer-level mapping, we develop a method named IR-EG and derive faster guarantees than those in (i). We also study the iteration complexity of this method under a constant regularization parameter. These results appear to be new for both bilevel VIs and VI-constrained optimization. (iii) To our knowledge, complexity guarantees for computing the optimal NE in nonconvex settings do not exist. Motivated by this lacuna, we consider VI-constrained nonconvex optimization problems and devise an inexactly projected gradient method, named IPR-EG, where the projection onto the unknown set of equilibria is performed using IR-EG with a prescribed termination criterion and an adaptive regularization parameter. We obtain new complexity guarantees in terms of a residual map and an infeasibility metric for computing a stationary point.

Although this computational framework presents many advantages, there are only a small number of algorithms which require one LMO evaluation per set per iteration; furthermore, these algorithms require to be convex. Our algorithm appears to be the first in this class which is proven to also converge in the nonconvex setting. Our approach combines a penalty method and a product-space relaxation. We show that one CG step is a sufficient subroutine for our penalty method to converge, and we provide several analytical results on the product-space relaxation’s properties and connections to other problems in optimization. We prove that our average Frank–Wolfe gap converges at a rate of —only a log factor worse than the vanilla CG algorithm with one set.},

It is assumed that constraint function values and derivatives are available, but only stochastic approximations of the objective function and its associated derivatives can be computed via inexact probabilistic zeroth- and first-order oracles. Under reasonable assumptions, a high probability bound on the number of iterations that the algorithm requires to reach a first-order -stationary iterate is derived, where is lower bounded by a positive quantity dictated by the noise level of the inexact probabilistic zeroth- and first-order oracles. Numerical results on standard nonlinear optimization test problems illustrate the advantages and limitations of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The problem of designing distributed optimization algorithms that are resilient to Byzantine adversaries has received significant attention. For the Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization problem, the goal is to (approximately) minimize the average of the local cost functions held by the regular (nonadversarial) agents in the network. In this paper, we provide a general algorithmic framework for Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization which includes some state-of-the-art algorithms as special cases. We analyze the convergence of algorithms within the framework, and derive a geometric rate of convergence of all regular agents to a ball around the optimal solution (whose size we characterize). Furthermore, we show that approximate consensus can be achieved geometrically fast under some minimal conditions. Our analysis provides insights into the relationship among the convergence region, distance between regular agents’ values, step size, and properties of the agents’ functions for Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Explicit exploration in the action space was assumed to be indispensable for online policy gradient methods to avoid a drastic degradation in sample complexity, for solving general reinforcement learning problems over finite state and action spaces. In this paper, we establish for the first time an sample complexity for online policy gradient methods without incorporating any exploration strategies. The essential development consists of two new on-policy evaluation operators and a novel analysis of the stochastic policy mirror descent method (SPMD) [G. Lan, Math. Program., 198 (2022), pp. 1059–1106]. SPMD with the first evaluation operator, called value-based estimation, tailors to the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Provided the Markov chains on the state space of generated policies are uniformly mixing with a nondiminishing minimal visitation measure, an sample complexity is obtained with a linear dependence on the size of the action space. SPMD with the second evaluation operator, namely truncated on-policy Monte Carlo (TOMC), attains an sample complexity, where mildly depends on the effective horizon and the size of the action space with properly chosen Bregman divergence (e.g., Tsallis divergence). SPMD with TOMC also exhibits stronger convergence properties in that it controls the optimality gap with high probability rather than in expectation. In contrast to explicit exploration, these new policy gradient methods can prevent repeatedly committing to potentially high-risk actions when searching for optimal policies.},

In this paper, we study a new parametric robust linear problem (PRLP) whose data are allowed to be perturbed not only on the objective and constraint functions but also on the size of the uncertainty sets. Using a dual approach, we examine the stability and sensitivity properties of PRLP by looking at how the behaviors of its optimal value function and solution map change according to the change of the parameters. More precisely, we examine the closedness and lower and upper semicontinuity of the solution map and the lower and upper semicontinuity as well as Lipschitz property of the optimal value function of PRLP varying around a reference parameter. In this way, we obtain the nonemptiness and boundedness of the solution sets and a characterization for the Lipschitz continuity of the optimal value function for semi-infinite linear programs when fixing the corresponding index sets.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a class of -regularized optimization problems and the associated smooth “overparameterized” optimization problems built upon the Hadamard parametrization, or equivalently, the Hadamard difference parametrization (HDP). We characterize the set of second-order stationary points of the HDP-based model and show that they correspond to some stationary points of the corresponding -regularized model. More importantly, we show that the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) exponent of the HDP-based model at a second-order stationary point can be inferred from that of the corresponding -regularized model under suitable assumptions. Our assumptions are general enough to cover a wide variety of loss functions commonly used in -regularized models, such as the least squares loss function and the logistic loss function. Since the KL exponents of many -regularized models are explicitly known in the literature, our results allow us to leverage these known exponents to deduce the KL exponents at second-order stationary points of the corresponding HDP-based models, which were previously unknown. Finally, we demonstrate how these explicit KL exponents at second-order stationary points can be applied to deducing the explicit local convergence rate of a standard gradient descent method for minimizing the HDP-based model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work addresses (mixed-integer) joint chance-constrained optimization problems in which the only uncertain parameter corresponds to the right-hand side coefficients in an inequality system. It exploits one-dimensional marginals to construct upper and lower models for the underlying joint probability function, which need not be differentiable or satisfy generalized concavity properties. Based on these models, two optimization methods are proposed. Neither of them requires the probability function’s (sub)gradients and can thus be considered derivative-free methods. The first approach iteratively enriches an upper model for the probability function within an outer approximation algorithm that is shown to compute, under mild assumptions, an approximate global solution to the nonconvex chance-constrained problem. When the problem’s data is linear, the outer approximation algorithm requires solving (approximately) a mixed-integer linear programming problem per iteration. The second method works with a lower model and penalization techniques to efficiently compute points satisfying a new criticality condition. The approach, which handles only continuous variables, defines iterates as critical points of a nonlinear master program that can be handled with off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers. Numerical experiments on academic chance-constrained problems highlight the approach’s potential and limitations.},

This paper is intended to serve as a low-hurdle introduction to nonlocality for graduate students and researchers with an engineering mechanics or physics background who did not have a formal introduction to the underlying mathematical basis. We depart from simple examples motivated by structural mechanics to form a physical intuition and demonstrate nonlocality using concepts familiar to most engineers. We then show how concepts of nonlocality are at the core of one of the most active current research fields in applied mechanics, namely, in phase-field modeling of fracture. From a mathematical perspective, these developments rest on the concept of convolution in both its discrete and its continuous forms. The previous mechanical examples may thus serve as an intuitive explanation of what convolution implies from a physical perspective. In the supplementary material we highlight a broader range of applications of the concepts of nonlocality and convolution in other branches of science and engineering by generalizing from the examples explained in detail in the main body of the article.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sparse matrix computations are ubiquitous in scientific computing. Given the recent interest in scientific machine learning, it is natural to ask how sparse matrix computations can leverage neural networks (NNs). Unfortunately, multilayer perceptron (MLP) NNs are typically not natural for either graph or sparse matrix computations. The issue lies with the fact that MLPs require fixed-sized inputs, while scientific applications generally generate sparse matrices with arbitrary dimensions and a wide range of different nonzero patterns (or matrix graph vertex interconnections). While convolutional NNs could possibly address matrix graphs where all vertices have the same number of nearest neighbors, a more general approach is needed for arbitrary sparse matrices, e.g., those arising from discretized partial differential equations on unstructured meshes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one such approach suitable to sparse matrices. The key idea is to define aggregation functions (e.g., summations) that operate on variable-size input data to produce data of a fixed output size so that MLPs can be applied. The goal of this paper is to provide an introduction to GNNs for a numerical linear algebra audience. Concrete GNN examples are provided to illustrate how many common linear algebra tasks can be accomplished using GNNs. We focus on iterative and multigrid methods that employ computational kernels such as matrix-vector products, interpolation, relaxation methods, and strength-of-connection measures. Our GNN examples include cases where parameters are determined a priori as well as cases where parameters must be learned. The intent of this paper is to help computational scientists understand how GNNs can be used to adapt machine learning concepts to computational tasks associated with sparse matrices. It is hoped that this understanding will further stimulate data-driven extensions of classical sparse linear algebra tasks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A dynamical system is a transformation of a phase space, and the transformation law is the primary means of defining as well as identifying the dynamical system and is the object of focus of many learning techniques. However, there are many secondary aspects of dynamical systems—invariant sets, the Koopman operator, and Markov approximations—that provide alternative objectives for learning techniques. Crucially, while many learning methods are focused on the transformation law, we find that forecast performance can depend on how well these other aspects of the dynamics are approximated. These different facets of a dynamical system correspond to objects in completely different spaces—namely, interpolation spaces, compact Hausdorff sets, unitary operators, and Markov operators, respectively. Thus, learning techniques targeting any of these four facets perform different kinds of approximations. We examine whether an approximation of any one of these aspects of the dynamics could lead to an approximation of another facet. Many connections and obstructions are brought to light in this analysis. Special focus is placed on methods of learning the primary feature—the dynamics law itself. The main question considered is the connection between learning this law and reconstructing the Koopman operator and the invariant set. The answers are tied to the ergodic and topological properties of the dynamics, and they reveal how these properties determine the limits of forecasting techniques.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Methods inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) are starting to fundamentally change computational science and engineering through breakthrough performance on challenging problems. However, the reliability and trustworthiness of such techniques is a major concern. In inverse problems in imaging, the focus of this paper, there is increasing empirical evidence that methods may suffer from hallucinations, i.e., false, but realistic-looking artifacts; instability, i.e., sensitivity to perturbations in the data; and unpredictable generalization, i.e., excellent performance on some images, but significant deterioration on others. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for these phenomena. We give mathematical explanations for how and when such effects arise in arbitrary reconstruction methods, with several of our results taking the form of “no free lunch” theorems. Specifically, we show that (i) methods that overperform on a single image can wrongly transfer details from one image to another, creating a hallucination; (ii) methods that overperform on two or more images can hallucinate or be unstable; (iii) optimizing the accuracy-stability tradeoff is generally difficult; (iv) hallucinations and instabilities, if they occur, are not rare events and may be encouraged by standard training; and (v) it may be impossible to construct optimal reconstruction maps for certain problems. Our results trace these effects to the kernel of the forward operator whenever it is nontrivial, but also apply to the case when the forward operator is ill-conditioned. Based on these insights, our work aims to spur research into new ways to develop robust and reliable AI-based methods for inverse problems in imaging.},

We survey the rapid development of risk measures over the last quarter century. From their beginning in financial engineering, we recount their spread to nearly all areas of engineering and applied mathematics. Solidly rooted in convex analysis, risk measures furnish a general framework for handling uncertainty with significant computational and theoretical advantages. We describe the key facts, list several concrete algorithms, and provide an extensive list of references for further reading. The survey recalls connections with utility theory and distributionally robust optimization, points to emerging applications areas such as fair machine learning, and defines measures of reliability.},

We demonstrate that is a regularization method and rigorously establish both its convergence and stability properties. We present selected numerical experiments in two-dimensional computed tomography, wherein we integrate the method with various reconstruction techniques , including filtered back projection (graphLa+FBP), standard Tikhonov (graphLa+Tik), total variation (graphLa+TV), and a trained deep neural network (graphLa+Net).

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider in this work an inverse acoustic scattering problem when only phaseless total field data is available. The inverse problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed due to the lack of phase information. Solving inverse scattering problems with phaseless data is important in applications as the collection of accurate phased data is usually difficult and expensive. A novel direct sampling method (DSM) will be developed to effectively estimate the locations and shapes of the unknown scatterers from phaseless data generated by a very limited number of incident waves. With a careful theoretical analysis of the behavior of the index function and some representative numerical examples, the new DSM is shown to be computationally efficient, easy to implement, and robust to large noise, and it does not require any prior knowledge of the unknown scatterers. Furthermore, to fully exploit the index functions obtained from the DSM, we further combine the DSM with a deep learning technique (DSM-DL) to achieve high-quality reconstructions. Several challenging and representative numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of reconstructions by DSM-DL. The DSM-DL networks trained by phased data are further theoretically and numerically shown to be able to solve problems with phaseless data. Additionally, our numerical experiments also show the DSM-DL can solve inverse scattering problems with mixed types of scatterers, which renders its applications in many important practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we consider a deep learning approach to the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem. It is well known that traditional deep learning relies solely on data, which may limit its performance for the inverse problem when only indirect observation data and a physical model are available. A fundamental question arises in light of these limitations: is it possible to enable deep learning to work on inverse problems without labeled data and to be aware of what it is learning? This work proposes a deep decomposition method (DDM) for such purposes, which does not require ground truth labels. It accomplishes this by providing physical operators associated with the scattering model to the neural network architecture. Additionally, a deep learning based data completion scheme is implemented in DDM to prevent distorting the solution of the inverse problem for limited aperture data. Furthermore, apart from addressing the ill-posedness imposed by the inverse problem itself, DDM is the first physics-aware machine learning technique that has the interpretability property for obstacle detection. The convergence result of DDM is theoretically investigated. We also prove that adding small noise to the input limited aperture data can introduce additional regularization terms and effectively improve the smoothness of the learned inverse operator. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed DDM even when the incident and observation apertures are extremely limited.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are widely used in scientific computing to tackle high-dimensional systems. However, traditional ROM methods may only partially capture the intrinsic geometric characteristics of the data. These characteristics encompass the underlying structure, relationships, and essential features crucial for accurate modeling. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel ROM framework that integrates optimal transport (OT) theory and neural network–based methods. Specifically, we investigate the kernel proper orthogonal decomposition method exploiting the Wasserstein distance as the custom kernel, and we efficiently train the resulting neural network employing the Sinkhorn algorithm. By leveraging an OT-based nonlinear reduction, the presented framework can capture the geometric structure of the data, which is crucial for accurate learning of the reduced solution manifold. When compared with traditional metrics such as mean squared error or cross-entropy, exploiting the Sinkhorn divergence as the loss function enhances stability during training, robustness against overfitting and noise, and accelerates convergence. To showcase the approach’s effectiveness, we conduct experiments on a set of challenging test cases exhibiting a slow decay of the Kolmogorov n-width. The results show that our framework outperforms traditional ROM methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Urban wind flow simulation, based on numerical methods, serves as a powerful tool for understanding the intricate interactions between urban structures and atmospheric conditions. The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) stands out as a popular choice for simulating urban wind flow. However, traditional LBM approaches face limitations in terms of scalability on large parallel computing systems and their ability to support high-resolution wind flow simulations across vast megacities spanning hundreds of square kilometers. In response to these challenges, we introduce THLB (Tianhe lattice Boltzmann), a purpose-built LBM simulator tailored for large-scale urban wind flow simulations. THLB streamlines the preprocessing of extensive simulation data through an innovative scheme that automatically identifies flow regions along irregular boundaries. Additionally, THLB integrates a novel processing pipeline and employs parallel optimization techniques, enhancing scalability and performance for large-scale LBM simulations. Our assessment of THLB involves conducting wind flow simulations within a megacity covering an area of at an impressive one-meter simulation resolution, featuring 150,000 buildings. This simulation represents the most extensive urban wind flow analysis to date, comprising over two trillion simulation lattices. We gauge THLB’s performance on the Tianhe new-generation supercomputer, harnessing more than 155 million heterogeneous cores. Our experimental results demonstrate exceptional performance and scalability, achieving a peak computation throughput of 24,553.43 G Lattices Updates Per Second (GLUPS), setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for LBM simulations. Despite the inherent challenges of large-scale LBM simulations, our approach showcases robust scalability, delivering 90.48% and 69.91% of weak and strong scaling efficiency, respectively.},

Low-rank approximations are widely used to reduce the memory footprint and operational complexity of numerous linear algebra algorithms in scientific computing and data analysis. In some of our recent work we have demonstrated that low-rank approximations can be stored using multiple arithmetic precisions to further reduce the storage and execution time. In this work we present a method that can produce this mixed-precision representation directly; this relies on a mixed-precision truncated rank-revealing QR factorization with pivoting. We present a floating-point error analysis and provide bounds on the error of the approximation demonstrating that the use of multiple precisions does not alter the overall accuracy. Finally, we present experimental results showing the execution time reduction for the cases where either classical or randomized pivoting are used. Reproducibility of computational results.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modern accelerators use hierarchical parallel programming models that enable massive multithreading within a processing element (PE), with multiple PEs per device driven by traditional processes. Batching is a technique for exposing PE-level parallelism in algorithms that have traditionally run on MPI processes or multiple threads within a single process. Opportunities for batching arise in, for example, kinetic discretizations of magnetized plasmas where collisions are advanced in velocity space at each spatial point independently. This paper builds on previous work on a high-performance, fully nonlinear, Landau collision operator by batching the linear solver, as well as batching the spatial point problems and adding new support for multiple grids for multiscale, multispecies problems. An anisotropic relaxation verification test that agrees well with previously published results and analytical models is presented. The performance results from NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI250X nodes are presented with hardware utilization analysis for each architecture. The entire implicit Landau operator time advance is implemented in Kokkos for performance portability, running entirely on the device and is available in the PETSc numerical library.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article is devoted to the numerical resolution of high frequency time-harmonic flow acoustic problems. We use a substructured optimized nonoverlapping Schwarz domain decomposition method as a solver in order to significantly reduce the memory footprint required by such problems. To accelerate the convergence of the iterative solver we develop suitable transmission conditions based on local approximations of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, taking into account convection by strongly nonuniform mean flows. The development relies on the construction of absorbing boundary conditions through microlocal analysis and pseudodifferential calculus. We analyze the potential of the method in academic settings and subsequently propose a robust domain decomposition methodology for problems of industrial relevance modeled by the Pierce linearized acoustic operator. The algorithm is implemented in an open-source high-order finite element library. It allows solving challenging three-dimensional problems with more than one billion high-order unknowns, by taking full advantage of modern computer architectures.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modeling and simulation of multiphase flows in complex geometries are challenging due to the complexity in describing the interface topology changes among different phases and the difficulty in implementing the boundary conditions on the irregular solid surface. In this work, we first developed a diffuse-domain based phase-field model for multiphase flows in complex geometries. In this model, the irregular fluid region is embedded into a larger and regular domain by introducing a smooth characteristic function. Then, the reduction-consistent and conservative phase-field equation for the multiphase field and the consistent and conservative Navier–Stokes equations for the flow field are reformulated as the diffuse-domain based consistent and conservative (DD-CC) equations where some additional source terms are added to reflect the effects of boundary conditions. In this case, there is no need to directly treat the complex boundary conditions on the irregular solid surface, and additionally, based on a matched asymptotic analysis, it is also shown that the DD-CC equations can converge to the original governing equations as the interface width parameter tends to zero. Furthermore, to solve the DD-CC equations, we proposed a novel and simple lattice Boltzmann (LB) method with a Hermite-moment-based collision matrix which can not only keep consistent and conservation properties, but also improve the numerical stability with a flexible parameter. With the help of the direct Taylor expansion, the macroscopic DD-CC equations can be recovered correctly from the present LB method. Finally, to test the capacity of the LB method, several benchmarks and complex problems are considered, and the numerical results show that the present LB method is accurate and efficient for the multiphase flows in complex geometries.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Patient-specific brain mesh generation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be a time-consuming task and require manual corrections, e.g., meshing the ventricular system or defining subdomains. To address this issue, we consider an image registration approach. The idea is to use the registration of an input MR image to a respective target in order to obtain a new mesh from a template mesh. To obtain the transformation, we solve an optimization problem that is constrained by a linear hyperbolic transport equation. We use a higher order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for discretization and motivate the numerical upwind scheme and its limitations from the continuous weak space–time formulation of the transport equation. We present a numerical implementation that builds on the finite element packages FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, numerical results for the registration of an input to a target MRI of two distinct individuals are presented. Moreover, it is shown that the registration transforms a manually crafted input mesh into a new mesh for the target subject while preserving mesh quality. Challenges of the algorithm are discussed.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method that simultaneously evolves cell averages and point values at cell interfaces. Within the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based point value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation issue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind direction, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from decoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two issues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax–Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. In addition, a shock sensor–based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well. Several challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step and high Mach number jets.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The parareal algorithm represents an important class of parallel-in-time algorithms for solving evolution equations and has been widely applied in practice. To achieve effective speed-up, the choice of the coarse propagator in the algorithm is vital. In this work, we investigate the use of optimized coarse propagators. Building upon the error estimation framework, we present a systematic procedure for constructing coarse propagators that enjoy desirable stability and consistent order. Additionally, we provide preliminary mathematical guarantees for the resulting parareal algorithm. Numerical experiments on a variety of settings, e.g., the linear diffusion model, the Allen–Cahn model, and the viscous Burgers model, show that the optimizing procedure can significantly improve parallel efficiency when compared with the more ad hoc choice of some conventional and widely used coarse propagators.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper proposes a second-order numerical method for solving nonlinear parabolic equations with degenerate mobility. The intrinsic degenerate mobility in the equation yields a globally bounded solution. A pivotal feature of our methodology is an appropriate reformulation of the equation into an equivalent form. After applying a discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization method, we derive a fully nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a splitting structure. By introducing a linear term into the ODE, an exponential temporal discretization method, which involves only linear solvers, is proposed based on integrating factors and strong stability preserving Runge–Kutta methods. Our approach is proven to exhibit second-order accuracy, ensures bound preservation and mass conservation, and demonstrates a favorable CFL condition , where and are the temporal and spatial mesh sizes, respectively. Comprehensive numerical tests validate the second-order accuracy and bound-preserving behaviors of our method.},

Stencil composition uses the idea of function composition, wherein two stencils with arbitrary orders of derivative are composed to obtain a stencil with a derivative order equal to the sum of the orders of the composing stencils. In this paper, we show how stencil composition can be applied to form finite difference stencils in order to numerically solve partial differential equations (PDEs). We present various properties of stencil composition and investigate the relationship between the order of accuracy of the composed stencil and that of the composing stencils. We also present comparisons between the stability restrictions of composed higher-order PDEs to their compact versions and numerical experiments wherein we verify the order of accuracy by convergence tests. To demonstrate an application to PDEs, a boundary value problem involving the two-dimensional biharmonic equation is numerically solved using stencil composition and the order of accuracy is verified by performing a convergence test. The method is then applied to the Cahn–Hilliard phase-field model. In addition to sample results in two and three dimensions for this benchmark problem, the stability, spectral properties, and sparsity are explored.},

The sPOD approximates transport-dominated flows by a sum of co-moving data fields. The proposed methods are derived from sPOD but optimize the co-moving fields directly and penalize their nuclear norm to promote a low rank of the individual data in the decomposition. A robustness term is added for handling interpolation errors and data noise. Using convex optimization tools, we derive three proximal algorithms to solve the decomposition problem. We report a numerical comparison with existing methods using synthetic data and then show the separation ability of our methods for incompressible and reactive flows. The resulting methodology is the basis of a new analysis paradigm that provides the same interpretability as POD for the individual co-moving fields.},

This work introduces a tensor network approach for the Kolmogorov backward equation via approximating directly the Markov operator. We show that the high-dimensional Markov operator can be obtained under a functional hierarchical tensor (FHT) ansatz with a hierarchical sketching algorithm. When the terminal condition admits an FHT ansatz, the proposed operator outputs an FHT ansatz for the PDE solution through an efficient functional tensor network contraction procedure. In addition, the proposed operator-based approach also provides an efficient way to solve the Kolmogorov forward equation when the initial distribution is in an FHT ansatz. We apply the proposed approach successfully to two challenging time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau models with hundreds of variables.},

  abstract     = {Dedicated to A. N. Shiryaev on his 90th birthday A general diffusion semimartingale is a one-dimensional path-continuous semimartingale that is also a regular strong Markov process. We say that a continuous semimartingale has the representation property if all local martingales w.r.t. its canonical filtration have an integral representation w.r.t. its continuous local martingale part. The representation property is of fundamental interest in the field of mathematical finance, where it is strongly connected to market completeness. The main result from this paper shows that the representation property holds for a general diffusion semimartingale (that is not started in an absorbing boundary point) if and only if its scale function is (locally) absolutely continuous on the interior of the state space. As an application of our main theorem, we deduce that the laws of general diffusion semimartingales with such scale functions are extreme points of their semimartingale problems, and, moreover, we construct a general diffusion semimartingale whose law is no extreme point of its semimartingale problem. These observations contribute to a solution of problems posed by J. Jacod and M. Yor and D. W. Stroock and M. Yor, respectively, on the extremality of strong Markov solutions.},

Some earlier theoretical results in this direction can be found in the book [R. S. Liptser and A. N. Shiryaev, Statistics of Random Processes, Springer, 2001]. Under an essentially less restrictive setting, we derive formulas for the moments of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the parameter $\lambda $ of the drift coefficient $f_{t}(\lambda )=a_{t}-\lambda b_{t}$ and prove the exponential boundedness of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ under a mild condition. In the provided examples we consider the mean-reverting ergodic diffusion process $\mathbf{X}$, where $b_{t}=X_{t}$, and the diffusion coefficient $\sigma_{t}=\sigma X_{t}^{\gamma }$. In particular, we provide nonasymptotic analytical and numerical results for the bias and mean-square error of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau }$ for the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (O--U) and Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) processes when $\tau =T$ is a fixed sample size, and $\tau =\tau_{H}$ is a specially chosen stopping time that guarantees a prescribed magnitude of $1/H$ for the variance of $\widehat{\lambda}_{\tau_{H}}$.},

  abstract     = {Dedicated to Albert Nikolaevich Shiryaev on the occasion of his 90th birthday We consider a model of a financial market with endogenous asset prices. An agent&#39;s strategy is called survival if its share of the total market wealth is bounded away from zero over the infinite time horizon regardless of the strategies used by the other agents. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for survival of strategies, which generalize known results that deal with construction of such strategies or only with necessary conditions for survival. The proofs rely mainly on martingale convergence theorems.},

  abstract     = {We consider “typical” asymptotic behavior of weighted sums of independent identically distributed random vectors in the $k$-dimensional space. We show that if the fifth absolute moment of a separate term is finite, then in the multidimensional central limit theorem, the convergence rate is $O(1/n^{3/2})$ under the Chebyshev--Edgeworth correction. This result generalizes a result of Bobkov [Edgeworth corrections in randomized central limit theorems, in Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, Springer, 2020, pp. 71--97] to the multidimensional case.},
