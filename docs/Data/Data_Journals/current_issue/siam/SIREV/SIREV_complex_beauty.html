  abstract     = {The book Mathematical Pictures at a Data Science Exhibition aims to introduce the reader to the many mathematical ideas that congregate under the ever-expanding umbrella of data science. Given the meteoric rise of this field and the immense speed at which it often moves, this book acts as a welcome road map for graduate students and researchers in the field. Given its focus on theory, the book should be most appreciated by mathematicians as well as theoretical statisticians and computer scientists. While algorithms are the main focus of the book, the exposition is by no means a hands-on tutorial in data science, but rather an introductory text on the theoretical ideas behind data science algorithms and problems.},

This paper is intended to serve as a low-hurdle introduction to nonlocality for graduate students and researchers with an engineering mechanics or physics background who did not have a formal introduction to the underlying mathematical basis. We depart from simple examples motivated by structural mechanics to form a physical intuition and demonstrate nonlocality using concepts familiar to most engineers. We then show how concepts of nonlocality are at the core of one of the most active current research fields in applied mechanics, namely, in phase-field modeling of fracture. From a mathematical perspective, these developments rest on the concept of convolution in both its discrete and its continuous forms. The previous mechanical examples may thus serve as an intuitive explanation of what convolution implies from a physical perspective. In the supplementary material we highlight a broader range of applications of the concepts of nonlocality and convolution in other branches of science and engineering by generalizing from the examples explained in detail in the main body of the article.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sparse matrix computations are ubiquitous in scientific computing. Given the recent interest in scientific machine learning, it is natural to ask how sparse matrix computations can leverage neural networks (NNs). Unfortunately, multilayer perceptron (MLP) NNs are typically not natural for either graph or sparse matrix computations. The issue lies with the fact that MLPs require fixed-sized inputs, while scientific applications generally generate sparse matrices with arbitrary dimensions and a wide range of different nonzero patterns (or matrix graph vertex interconnections). While convolutional NNs could possibly address matrix graphs where all vertices have the same number of nearest neighbors, a more general approach is needed for arbitrary sparse matrices, e.g., those arising from discretized partial differential equations on unstructured meshes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one such approach suitable to sparse matrices. The key idea is to define aggregation functions (e.g., summations) that operate on variable-size input data to produce data of a fixed output size so that MLPs can be applied. The goal of this paper is to provide an introduction to GNNs for a numerical linear algebra audience. Concrete GNN examples are provided to illustrate how many common linear algebra tasks can be accomplished using GNNs. We focus on iterative and multigrid methods that employ computational kernels such as matrix-vector products, interpolation, relaxation methods, and strength-of-connection measures. Our GNN examples include cases where parameters are determined a priori as well as cases where parameters must be learned. The intent of this paper is to help computational scientists understand how GNNs can be used to adapt machine learning concepts to computational tasks associated with sparse matrices. It is hoped that this understanding will further stimulate data-driven extensions of classical sparse linear algebra tasks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A dynamical system is a transformation of a phase space, and the transformation law is the primary means of defining as well as identifying the dynamical system and is the object of focus of many learning techniques. However, there are many secondary aspects of dynamical systems—invariant sets, the Koopman operator, and Markov approximations—that provide alternative objectives for learning techniques. Crucially, while many learning methods are focused on the transformation law, we find that forecast performance can depend on how well these other aspects of the dynamics are approximated. These different facets of a dynamical system correspond to objects in completely different spaces—namely, interpolation spaces, compact Hausdorff sets, unitary operators, and Markov operators, respectively. Thus, learning techniques targeting any of these four facets perform different kinds of approximations. We examine whether an approximation of any one of these aspects of the dynamics could lead to an approximation of another facet. Many connections and obstructions are brought to light in this analysis. Special focus is placed on methods of learning the primary feature—the dynamics law itself. The main question considered is the connection between learning this law and reconstructing the Koopman operator and the invariant set. The answers are tied to the ergodic and topological properties of the dynamics, and they reveal how these properties determine the limits of forecasting techniques.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Methods inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) are starting to fundamentally change computational science and engineering through breakthrough performance on challenging problems. However, the reliability and trustworthiness of such techniques is a major concern. In inverse problems in imaging, the focus of this paper, there is increasing empirical evidence that methods may suffer from hallucinations, i.e., false, but realistic-looking artifacts; instability, i.e., sensitivity to perturbations in the data; and unpredictable generalization, i.e., excellent performance on some images, but significant deterioration on others. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for these phenomena. We give mathematical explanations for how and when such effects arise in arbitrary reconstruction methods, with several of our results taking the form of “no free lunch” theorems. Specifically, we show that (i) methods that overperform on a single image can wrongly transfer details from one image to another, creating a hallucination; (ii) methods that overperform on two or more images can hallucinate or be unstable; (iii) optimizing the accuracy-stability tradeoff is generally difficult; (iv) hallucinations and instabilities, if they occur, are not rare events and may be encouraged by standard training; and (v) it may be impossible to construct optimal reconstruction maps for certain problems. Our results trace these effects to the kernel of the forward operator whenever it is nontrivial, but also apply to the case when the forward operator is ill-conditioned. Based on these insights, our work aims to spur research into new ways to develop robust and reliable AI-based methods for inverse problems in imaging.},

Due to inherent risk-averseness and ambiguity about assumptions, it is common to address uncertainty by formulating and solving conservative optimization models expressed using measures of risk and related concepts. We survey the rapid development of risk measures over the last quarter century. From their beginning in financial engineering, we recount their spread to nearly all areas of engineering and applied mathematics. Solidly rooted in convex analysis, risk measures furnish a general framework for handling uncertainty with significant computational and theoretical advantages. We describe the key facts, list several concrete algorithms, and provide an extensive list of references for further reading. The survey recalls connections with utility theory and distributionally robust optimization, points to emerging applications areas such as fair machine learning, and defines measures of reliability.},
