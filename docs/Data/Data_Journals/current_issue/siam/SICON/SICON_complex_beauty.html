Then a necessary and sufficient condition is given to determine the existence of time-invariant state feedback controllers, and if they exist, the design of such controllers is given using the matrix approach above. As an extension of the results above, the design of output feedback controllers is obtained using the constructed truth matrix.

Under the -stability framework, we study a class of linear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) in infinite horizon and discuss the open-loop and closed-loop solvabilities of the SLQ problem. The open-loop solvability is characterized by the solvability of a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) in infinite horizon and the convexity of the cost functional, and the closed-loop solvability is shown to be equivalent to the open-loop solvability, which, in turn, is equivalent to the existence of a static stabilizing solution to the associated constrained coupled algebra Riccati equations (CAREs). Under the uniform convexity assumption, we obtain the unique solvability of associated CAREs and construct the corresponding closed-loop optimal strategy. Finally, we also solve a class of discounted SLQ problems and give two concrete examples to illustrate the results developed in the earlier sections.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A nonconventional shape optimization approach is introduced to address the identification of an obstacle immersed in a fluid described by the Stokes equation within a larger bounded domain, relying on boundary measurements on the accessible surface. The approach employs tools from shape optimization, utilizing the coupled complex boundary method to transform the overspecified problem into a complex boundary value problem by incorporating a complex Robin boundary condition. This condition is derived by coupling the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions along the accessible boundary. The identification of the obstacle involves optimizing a cost function constructed based on the imaginary part of the solution across the entire domain. The subsequent calculation of the shape gradient of this cost function, rigorously performed via the rearrangement method, enables the iterative solution of the optimization problem using a Sobolev gradient descent algorithm. The feasibility of the method is illustrated through numerical experiments in both two and three spatial dimensions, demonstrating its effectiveness in reconstructing obstacles with pronounced concavities under high-level noise-contaminated data, all without perimeter or volume functional penalization.},

By establishing the dynamic programming principle, we shed light on the value function of the control problem with an integral-partial differential equation of HJB type in the sense of viscosity solutions. On the other hand, stochastic verification theorems are also studied to provide sufficient conditions to verify the optimality of the given admissible controls. Such a study is carried out within the framework of classical solutions as well as in that of viscosity solutions. Our work emphasizes important differences from the approach for finite time horizon problems. In particular, we have to work in an -setting for in order to study the verification theorem in viscosity sense.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For a general entropy-regularized stochastic control problem on an infinite horizon, we prove that a policy iteration algorithm (PIA) converges to an optimal relaxed control. Contrary to the standard stochastic control literature, classical Hölder estimates of value functions do not ensure the convergence of the PIA, due to the added entropy-regularizing term. To circumvent this, we carry out a delicate estimation by moving back and forth between appropriate Hölder and Sobolev spaces. This requires new Sobolev estimates designed specifically for the purpose of policy iteration and a nontrivial technique to contain the entropy growth. Ultimately, we obtain a uniform Hölder bound for the sequence of value functions generated by the PIA, thereby achieving the desired convergence result. Characterization of the optimal value function as the unique solution to an exploratory Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation comes as a by-product.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) theory plays a significant role in formulating multifarious delay-dependent stability criteria for general systems with time delays. However, the existing delay-dependent results in the framework of LKF for delayed directed networks (DDNs) are generally dependent on the number of nodes in the networks, which are inapplicable to networks with a large size due to the computational complexity of exponential growth. For handling this situation, an interesting property of the Kronecker product is discovered and summarized in this work. Then, by constructing the topology-dependent multiple LKF approach and an ameliorative combined switching strategy, a delay-dependent but -independent pinning synchronization criterion is skillfully developed for the addressed switched delayed directed networks, where “-independent” indicates that the synchronization criterion is independent of the number of nodes. With the ameliorative combined switching strategy, different minimum dwell times are assured for each subnetwork, and none of the subnetworks are required to be synchronized in advance. Apart from that, a simple -independent pinning synchronization criterion for nonswitched DNNs is also discussed. Finally, the applicability of the proposed pinning synchronization approach is verified through a simulation example.},
