  abstract     = {Abstract. Max-plus algebra is a semiring with addition and multiplication . It is applied in cases such as combinatorial optimization and discrete event systems. We consider the power of max-plus square matrices, which is equivalent to obtaining the all-pair maximum weight paths with a fixed length in the corresponding weighted digraph. Each -by- matrix admits the CSR expansion that decomposes the matrix into a sum of at most periodic terms after times of powers. In this study, we propose an time algorithm for the CSR expansion, where is the number of nonzero entries in the matrix, which improves the algorithm known for this problem. Our algorithm is based on finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the max-plus matrix. These roots play a similar role to the eigenvalues of the matrix and become the growth rates of the terms in the CSR expansion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods to multiple agents and focus on the proportionality, which is one of the classical fairness notions. Since proportional allocations do not always exist when goods are indivisible, approximate concepts of proportionality have been considered in previous work. Among them, proportionality up to the maximin good (PROPm) has been the best approximate notion of proportionality that can be achieved for all instances [A. Baklanov et al., PROPm allocations of indivisible goods to multiple agents, in Proceedings of the 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021, pp. 24–30]. In this paper, we introduce the notion of proportionality up to the least valued good on average (PROPavg), which is a stronger notion than PROPm, and show that a PROPavg allocation always exists for all instances and can be computed in polynomial time. Our results establish PROPavg as a notable nontrivial fairness notion that can be achieved for all instances. Our proof is constructive and is based on a new technique that generalizes the cut-and-choose protocol and uses a recursive technique.},

Moreover, we exhibit an infinite family of obstructions that each induces a different asymptotic behavior for this extremal value.

Minimizing the weight of an edge set satisfying parity constraints is a challenging branch of combinatorial optimization as witnessed by the binary hypergraph chapter of Alexander Schrijver’s book [Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, 2003, Chapter 80]. This area contains relevant graph theory problems including open cases of the Max Cut problem and some multiflow problems. We clarify the interconnections between some of these problems and establish three levels of difficulty. On the one hand, we prove that the Shortest Odd Path problem in undirected graphs without cycles of negative total weight and several related problems are NP-hard, settling a long-standing open question asked by Lovász (Open Problem 27 in Schrijver’s book [Combinatorial Optimization, Springer-Verlag, 2003]). On the other hand, we provide an algorithm for the closely related and well-studied Minimum-weight Odd -Join problem for nonnegative weights: our algorithm runs in FPT time parameterized by , where is the number of connected components in some efficiently computed minimum-weight -join. If negative weights are also allowed, then finding a minimum-weight odd -join is equivalent to the Minimum-weight Odd -Join problem for arbitrary weights, whose complexity is still only conjectured to be polynomially solvable. The analogous problems for digraphs are also considered.},

The most general algorithmic result for -Recoloring so far was proposed by Wrochna in 2014, who introduced a topological approach to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for any undirected loopless square-free graph . We show that the topological approach can be used to recover essentially all previous algorithmic results for -Recoloring and that it is applicable also in the more general setting of digraph homomorphisms. In particular, we show that -Recoloring admits a polynomial-time algorithm if (i) is a loopless digraph that does not contain a 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0 and (ii) is a reflexive digraph that contains no triangle of algebraic girth 1 and no 4-cycle of algebraic girth 0. In both cases, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for finding shortest transformations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. MAX NAE-SAT is a natural optimization problem, closely related to its better-known relative MAX SAT. The approximability status of MAX NAE-SAT is almost completely understood if all clauses have the same size for some . We refer to this problem as MAX NAE--SAT. For , it is a slight extension of the celebrated MAX CUT problem. For , it is related to the MAX CUT problem in graphs that can be fractionally covered by triangles. For , it is known that an approximation ratio of , obtained by choosing a random assignment, is optimal, assuming . For every , an approximation ratio of at least can be obtained for MAX NAE--SAT. There was some hope, therefore, that there is also a -approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, where clauses of all sizes are allowed simultaneously. Our main result is that there is no -approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). In fact, even for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE--SAT (i.e., MAX NAE-SAT where all clauses have size 3 or 5), the best approximation ratio that can be achieved, assuming UGC, is at most . Using calculus of variations, we extend the analysis of O’Donnell and Wu for MAX CUT to MAX NAE--SAT. We obtain an optimal algorithm, assuming UGC, for MAX NAE--SAT, slightly improving on previous algorithms. The approximation ratio of the new algorithm is about 0.9089. This gives a full understanding of MAX NAE--SAT for every . Interestingly, the rounding function used by this optimal algorithm is the solution of an integral equation. We complement our theoretical results with some experimental results. We describe an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE--SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8728, and an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE-SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8698. We further conjecture that these are essentially the best approximation ratios that can be achieved for these problems, assuming the UGC. Somewhat surprisingly, the rounding functions used by these approximation algorithms are nonmonotone step functions that assume only the values .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We define noncrossing partitions of a marked surface without punctures (interior marked points). We show that the natural partial order on noncrossing partitions is a graded lattice and describe its rank function topologically. Lower intervals in the lattice are isomorphic to products of noncrossing partition lattices of other surfaces. We similarly define noncrossing partitions of a symmetric marked surface with double points and prove some of the analogous results. The combination of symmetry and double points plays a role that one might have expected to be played by punctures.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the polynomial ideal membership problem (IMP) for ideals encoding combinatorial problems that are instances of constraint satisfaction problems over a finite language. In this paper, the input polynomial has degree at most (we call this problem IMP). We bridge the gap in [M. Mastrolilli, The complexity of the ideal membership problem for constrained problems over the Boolean domain, in SODA ’19, Proceedings of the Thirtieth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, Philadelphia, PA, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2019, pp. 456–475] by proving that the IMP for Boolean combinatorial ideals whose constraints are closed under the minority polymorphism can be solved in polynomial time. This completes the identification of the tractability for the Boolean . We also prove that the proof of membership for the for problems constrained by the dual discriminator polymorphism over any finite domain can be found in polynomial time. Our results can be used in applications such as Nullstellensatz and sum-of-squares proofs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the following variant of the edge-augmentation problem: Given a -edge-connected graph with no loops or multiple edges, find a smallest edge set in the complement whose addition to results in a -edge-connected graph. We establish the following dichotomy for this problem: If the complement of contains a matching covering all vertices of -degree (and possibly more), then the complement also contains a matching whose addition to results in a -edge-connected graph. A smallest matching which augments the minimum degree can be found, in polynomial time, by Edmonds’ matching algorithm, but it need not augment the edge-connectivity. Indeed, it is NP-hard to find a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting edge set, by a result of Tibor Jordán. On the other hand, if the complement of contains no matching covering all vertices of -degree , then the complement has a minimum degree augmenting path system consisting of paths of length 1 or 2. Again we can find such a path system with as few edges as possible by Edmonds’ matching algorithm. We can, in polynomial time, modify it to an edge-connectivity augmenting path system of paths of length 1 or 2 with the same number of edges, and this time it yields a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting set of edges. Combining these results, we conclude that a smallest edge-connectivity augmenting edge set in the complement of a -regular, -edge-connected simple graph has size , where is the number of vertices of , and is the size of a maximum matching in the complement of . Another corollary is that the complement of every simple noncomplete graph with vertices has a set of at most edges whose addition to results in a graph of larger edge-connectivity, with equality holding if and only the complement of is a disjoint union of 3-cycles.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Defant, Li, Propp, and Young recently resolved two enumerative conjectures of Propp concerning the tilings of regions in the hexagonal grid called benzels using two types of prototiles called stones and bones (with varying constraints on allowed orientations of the tiles). Their primary tool, a bijection called compression that converts certain -ribbon tilings to -ribbon tilings, allowed them to reduce their problems to the enumeration of dimers (i.e., perfect matchings) of certain graphs. We present a generalized version of compression that no longer relies on the perspective of partitions and skew shapes. Using this strengthened tool, we resolve three more of Propp’s conjectures and recast several others as problems about perfect matchings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A framework consists of an undirected graph and a matroid whose elements correspond to the vertices of . Recently, Fomin et al.

More precisely, for vertices and of , and an integer , they gave FPT algorithms parameterized by deciding whether there is an -path in whose vertex set contains a subset of elements of of rank . These algorithms are based on the Schwartz–Zippel lemma for polynomial identity testing and thus are randomized, and therefore the existence of a deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem remains open. We present the first deterministic FPT algorithm that solves the problem in frameworks whose underlying graph is planar. While the running time of our algorithm is worse than the running times of the recent randomized algorithms, our algorithm works on more general classes of matroids. In particular, this is the first FPT algorithm for the case when matroid is represented over rationals. We complement this result by proving that if the input matroids are given by their independence oracles, then there is no algorithm solving the problem with oracle queries. Furthermore, this computational lower bound holds even if the input graphs are planar graphs of treewidth at most two.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the classical cake cutting problem where we wish to fairly divide a heterogeneous resource among interested agents. Work on this subject typically assumes that the cake is represented by an interval. We introduce a generalized setting where the cake is represented by an arbitrary undirected graph, which allows us to model the division of road networks. Unlike in the interval setting, common fairness criteria such as proportionality cannot always be satisfied in graphical cake cutting if each agent must receive a connected subgraph. We determine the optimal approximation of proportionality that can be obtained for any number of agents with additive valuations, and exhibit a tight guarantee for each graph in the case of two agents. We also study several variants and extensions, including when more than one connected piece per agent is allowed as well as when the item to be divided is undesirable.},
