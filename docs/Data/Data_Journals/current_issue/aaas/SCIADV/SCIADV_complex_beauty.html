  abstract     = {Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent nonequilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a “nonlocal” pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe 2 , several microns away from the illumination spot. We identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons’ linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results will allow exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.},

In this work, we curate a peptide assembly database through a combination of manual processing by human experts and large language model–assisted literature mining. As a result, we collect over 1000 experimental data entries with information about peptide sequence, experimental conditions, and corresponding self-assembly phases. Using the data, machine learning models are developed, demonstrating excellent accuracy (&gt;80%) in assembly phase classification. Moreover, we fine-tune a GPT model for peptide literature mining with the developed dataset, which markedly outperforms the pretrained model in extracting information from academic publications. This workflow can improve efficiency when exploring potential self-assembling peptide candidates, through guiding experimental work, while also deepening our understanding of the governing mechanisms.},

Understanding physical differences between euchromatin and heterochromatin is crucial, yet specific labeling methods in living cells remain limited. Here, we have developed replication-dependent histone (Repli-Histo) labeling to mark nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. Using this approach, we investigated local nucleosome motion in the four known chromatin classes, from euchromatin to heterochromatin, of living human and mouse cells. The more euchromatic (earlier-replicated) and more heterochromatic (later-replicated) regions exhibit greater and lesser nucleosome motions, respectively. Notably, the motion profile in each chromatin class persists throughout interphase. Genome chromatin is essentially replicated from regions with greater nucleosome motions, although the replication timing is perturbed. Our findings, combined with computational modeling, suggest that earlier-replicated regions have more accessibility, and local chromatin motion can be a major determinant of genome-wide replication timing.},

DNMT3B is intricately regulated by histone H3 modifications, yet the dynamic interplay between DNMT3B and histone modifications remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the PWWP (proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline) domain within DNMT3B exhibits remarkable dynamics that enhances the enzyme’s methyltransferase activity upon interactions with a modified histone H3 peptide (H3K4 me0 K36 me3 ). In the presence of H3K4 me0 K36 me3 , both the PWWP and ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L) domains transition from autoinhibitory to active conformations. In this active state, the PWWP domain most often aligns closely with the catalytic domain, allowing for simultaneous interactions with H3 and DNA to stimulate DNA methylation. The prostate cancer–associated DNMT3B R545C mutant is even more dynamic and susceptible to adopting the active conformation, resulting in aberrant DNA hypermethylation. Our study suggests the mechanism by which conformational rearrangements in DNMT3B are triggered by histone modifications, ultimately unleashing its activity in DNA methylation.},

It is present in Africa, Europe, Asia, and in the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. There are no effective treatments or broadly licensed vaccines to prevent disease. Efforts to counteract ASF have been hampered because of the lack of convenient tools to engineer its etiological agent, ASF virus (ASFV), largely due to its large noninfectious genome. Here, we report the use of synthetic genomics methodology to develop a reverse genetics system for ASFV using a CRISPR-Cas9–inhibited self-helper virus to reconstitute live recombinant ASFV from synthetic genomes to rapidly generate a variety of combinatorial mutants of ASFV. The method will substantially facilitate the development of therapeutics or subunit and live-attenuated vaccines for ASF. This synthetic genomics-based approach has wide-ranging impact because it can be applied to rapidly develop reverse genetics tools for emerging viruses with noninfectious genomes.},

OpenCRISPR-1 is a CRISPR system synthesized de novo using large language models (LLMs) but has not yet undergone systematic characterization. Using AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq, we assessed the on-target activity and off-target profiles of these systems across multiple genomic loci. FrCas9 demonstrated higher on-target efficiency and substantially fewer off-target effects than SpCas9 and OpenCRISPR-1. Furthermore, TREX2 fusion with FrCas9 reduced large deletions and translocations, enhancing genomic stability. Through screening of 1903 sgRNAs targeting 21 CGT-relevant genes using sequential AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq analysis, we identified optimal sgRNAs for each gene. Our high-throughput screening platform highlights FrCas9, particularly in its TREX2-fused form, as a highly specific and efficient tool for precise therapeutic genome editing.},

We investigated associations between steroid levels and biological sex, age, clinical and demographic data, genetics, and plasma proteomics. Steroid hormone levels were strongly affected by sex and age, and a high number of lifestyle habits. Key observations were the broad impact of hormonal birth control in female donors and the relationship with smoking in male donors. In a 10-year follow-up study, we identified significant associations between steroid hormone levels and health status only in male donors. These observations highlight biological and lifestyle parameters affecting steroid hormones, and underlie the importance of considering sex, age, and potentially gendered behaviors in the treatment of hormone-related diseases.},

Here, we demonstrate quantum storage of photonic qubits for 1.021 milliseconds based on a laser-written optical waveguide fabricated in a 151 Eu 3+ :Y 2 SiO 5 crystal. Spin dephasing of 151 Eu 3+ is mitigated through dynamical decoupling applied via on-chip electric waveguides, and we obtain a storage efficiency of 12.0 ± 0.5% at 1.021 milliseconds, which is a demonstration of integrated quantum memories that outperforms the efficiency of a simple fiber delay line. Such long-lived waveguide-based quantum memory could support applications in quantum repeaters, and further combination with critical magnetic fields could enable potential application as transportable quantum memories.},

This phosphorylation stabilizes Toc33 by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Constitutive triple response 1 (CTR1), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling, and its paralog RAF-like kinase are involved in phosphorylating Toc33. Disruption of Toc33 phosphorylation impairs its stability and photosynthetic protein import, consequently affecting chloroplast structural integrity and biogenesis. Our findings underscore the essential role of TOC phosphorylation in chloroplast biogenesis and reveal an unexpected regulatory network involving RAF-like kinases in organelle development.},

Here, we developed animal models to investigate the mechanisms behind asymmetric cross-protection between contemporary FLUBV lineages. Our results show that contemporary Victoria immunity provides robust cross-protection against the Yamagata lineage, whereas Yamagata immunity offers limited protection against the Victoria lineage. This differential cross-protection is driven by Victoria-elicited neuraminidase (NA)–specific antibodies, which show cross-lineage reactivity, unlike those from Yamagata infections. These findings identify a phenomenon in contemporary FLUBV that may help explain the recent disappearance of the Yamagata lineage from circulation, highlighting the crucial role of targeting NA in vaccination strategies to enhance cross-lineage FLUBV protection.},

Using a combination of atmospheric reanalysis, satellite data, and hydrologic modeling, we overcame key limitations typical of data-scarce, high-variability regions and revealed that despite the catastrophic impact, the return periods of the rainfall and flood were only a few decades. Hydraulic simulations revealed that the dam failures amplified the damage nearly 20-fold compared to a dam-free scenario.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in wearable sweat sensors, which use standardized electrochemical and colorimetric mechanisms, offer holistic representation of health status for users. However, the constraints of standardized sweat sensors present ongoing challenges to realization of personalized health management. This study presents an electrocolorimetric (EC) platform that enables the reversible and multiple-time use of colorimetric data visualization using electrophoretic display (EPD). This platform represents the application of low-power EPD in epidermal sweat sensor, evaluated through CIELAB-based methodology which is the first systematic evaluation tool of wearable display performance. Moreover, our platform has been demonstrated in human exercise trials for its ability to detect the lactate threshold (LT). This digital colorimetric system has the potential to play a pivotal role by integrating various health monitoring biomarkers. While providing real-time, continuous, and adjustable range information with high sensitivity, this platform validates its extensive probability as a next-generation wearable epidermal sensor.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic dysregulation represents one of the major driving forces in aging. Although multiple genetic and pharmacological manipulations are known to extend longevity in model organisms, aging is a complex trait, and targeting one’s own genes may be insufficient to prevent age-dependent deterioration. An alternative strategy could be to use enzymes from other species to reverse age-associated metabolic changes. In this review, we discuss a set of enzymes from lower organisms that have been shown to affect various metabolic parameters linked to age-related processes. These enzymes include modulators of steady-state levels of amino acids (METase, ASNase, and ADI), NADPH/NADP + and/or reduced form of coenzyme Q (CoQH 2 )/CoQ redox potentials (NDI1, AOX, Lb NOX, TPNOX, Ec STH, RquA, LOXCAT, Grubraw, and ScURA), GSH (StGshF), mitochondrial membrane potential (mtON and mito-dR), or reactive oxygen species (DAAO and KillerRed-SOD1). We propose that leveraging non-mammalian enzymes represents an untapped resource that can be used to delay aging and age-related diseases.},

To mitigate such escape, we preemptively enhance AZD3152, an antibody authorized for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, we identify AZD3152 vulnerabilities at antigen positions F456 and D420. Through two iterations of computational antibody design that integrates structure-based modeling, machine-learning, and experimental validation, we co-optimize AZD3152 against 24 contemporary and previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as 20 potential future escape variants. Our top candidate, 3152-1142, restores full potency (100-fold improvement) against the more recently emerged XBB.1.5+F456L variant that escaped AZD3152, maintains potency against previous variants of concern, and shows no additional vulnerability as assessed by DMS.

  abstract     = {The discovery of compressed atomic-type hydrides offers a promising avenue toward achieving room-temperature superconductivity, but it necessitates extremely high pressures to completely dissociate hydrogen molecules to release free electrons. Here, we report a remarkable finding of compressed H 2 -molecular–type hydride CaH 14 exhibiting an unusual transition temperature ( T c ) of 204.0 kelvin. The peculiarity of its electronic structure lies in the pronounced emergence of near-free electrons, which manifest metallic bonding, but molecular hydrogen fragments persist. This finding indicates that the necessary condition for superconducting transition is forming the Fermi sea with Cooper pairs rather than the monatomic hydrogen. Notably, the formation mechanism of free electrons can be effectively explained by the finite-depth potential wells model. Intriguingly, this H 2 -molecular–type hydride can downgrade the required pressure to 80 gigapascal while maintaining a high T c of 84 kelvin, well above the liquid-nitrogen temperature. Our study has established a high-temperature superconducting paradigm and opened the prospect for achieving high- T c superconductors in H 2 -molecular–type hydrides at low pressure.},

In view of clinical translation of dual AAV intein vectors, here we set to evaluate both the efficiency and safety of their subretinal administration in relevant large animal models. Accordingly, we have developed the first pig model of STGD1, which we found to accumulate lipofuscin similarly to patients. This accumulation is significantly reduced upon subretinal administration of dual AAV intein vectors whose safety and pharmacodynamics we then tested in nonhuman primates, which showed modest and reversible inflammation as well as high levels of photoreceptor transduction. This bodes well for further clinical translation of dual AAV intein vectors in patients with STGD1 as well as for other blinding diseases that require the delivery of large genes.},

Alternative pathways (APs) have been designed to relocate the decarboxylation step or even fix additional carbon. To improve the success of transferring those engineered APs from model species to crops, we must understand how they will interact with metabolism and how plant physiology affects their performance. Here, we used multiple mathematical modeling techniques to analyze and compare existing AP designs. We show that carbon-fixing APs are the most promising candidates to replace native photorespiration in major crop species. Our results demonstrate the different metabolic routes that APs use to increase yield and which plant physiology can profit the most from them. We anticipate our results to guide the design of new APs and to help improve existing ones.},

Inspired by Parthenocissus , we propose a growing-climbing mechanism and report a soft climbing robot, which grows microstructured biofilms to enhance adhesion, similar to Parthenocissus growing suckers and adsorbing to the wall. The robot uses shape memory alloy contraction to achieve bending, similar to Parthenocissus using gelatinous fibers contraction to achieve hinge-like bending. In addition, to not damage the site, it can be fully contracted after completing tasks. The climbing robot can climb on various complex surfaces, especially discontinuous surfaces, verifying the effectiveness of Parthenocissus ’ growing-climbing mechanism. The growing-climbing mechanism is a universal climbing robot paradigm, opening a door for complex surface climbing robots.},

The answer is yes, and trilayer goldene is the magic number, for reasons of electronegativity. Experiments are made to synthesize the atomically laminated phase Ti 4 Au 3 C 3 through substitutional intercalation of Si layers in Ti 4 SiC 3 for Au. Density functional theory calculations suggest that it is energetically favorable to insert three layers of Au into Ti 4 SiC 3 , compared to inserting a monolayer, a bilayer, or more than three layers. Isolated trilayer goldene sheets, ~100 nanometers wide and 6.7 angstroms thick, were obtained by chemically etching the Ti 4 C 3 layers from Ti 4 Au 3 C 3 templates. Furthermore, trilayer goldene is found in both hcp and fcc forms, where the hcp is ~50 milli–electron volts per atom more stable at room temperature from ab initio molecular dynamic simulations.},

This system leverages bacterial tropism to enhance macrophage infiltration and polarization. The low oxygen levels trigger in situ aCD47 expression, blocking the “do not eat me” signal and boosting macrophage antitumor activity.

Cross-[4+2] cycloadditions offer greater product diversity than traditional diene-dienophile reactions due to multiple possible pathways. However, precise control over regio- and stereoselectivity for various isomers remains a great challenge. This study reports catalyst-controlled regiodivergent formal cross-cycloadditions of acyclic dienes and enones, significantly enhancing access to diverse pyrazole-fused spirooxindoles. Chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis enables endoselective [4+2] cycloadditions, while Bi(III) with a CPA ligand yields [2+4] products with high regio- and stereoselectivity. A Claisen rearrangement of the [2+4] adduct produces the exo-selective [4+2] product, further increasing stereochemical diversity and enabling the synthesis of six regio- and stereo-isomers from a single substrate set. DFT calculations reveal that Bi(III) reverses regioselectivity by repositioning reactants in the CPA pocket and stabilizing the enone oxygen’s negative charge. In addition, product 3as demonstrates therapeutic potential against triple-negative breast cancer, with an IC 50 of 8.5 μM in MDA-MB-453 cells.},

Here, we present a scalable nanofabrication technique that combines bottom-up and top-down approaches for selective growth of 3D DNA superlattices on gold microarrays. This approach allows for the fabrication of self-assembled 3D-nanostructured electronic devices. DNA strands are bound onto the gold arrays, which anchor DNA origami frames and promote ordered framework growth on the specific areas of the surface, enabling control of the lateral placement and orientation of superlattices. DNA frameworks selectively grown on the pads are subsequently templated to nanoscale silica and tin oxide (SnO x ) that follow the architecture, as confirmed by structural and chemical characterizations. The fabricated SnO x superlattices are integrated into devices that demonstrate photocurrent response.},

  abstract     = {Pioneer transcription factors (TFs) initiate chromatin remodeling, which is crucial for gene regulation and cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated how the sequential expression of neurogenin 3 (NGN3) and NEUROD1 affects their pioneering functions during pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we mapped NGN3-binding sites, confirming the pivotal role of this molecule in regulating chromatin accessibility. The pioneering function of NGN3 involves dose tolerance, and low doses are sufficient. Although NEUROD1 generally acts as a conventional TF, it can assume a pioneering role in the absence of NGN3. The sequential expression of NeuroD1 and Ngn3 predominantly drives α cell generation, which may explain the inefficient β cell induction observed in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that pioneer activity is dynamically shaped by temporal TF expression and inter-TF interactions, providing insights into transcriptional regulation and its implications for disease mechanisms and therapeutic targeting and enhancing in vitro differentiation strategies.},

Here, we found that Ca 2+ leakage after Mtb phagosome damage in human macrophages is the signal that triggers autophagy-related protein 8/microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (ATG8/LC3) lipidation. Unexpectedly, ATG8/LC3 lipidation did not target Mtb to lysosomes, excluding the canonical xenophagy. Upon Mtb phagosome damage, the Ca 2+ leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation occurred on multiple membranes instead of single or double membranes excluding the noncanonical autophagy pathways. Mechanistically, Ca 2+ leakage from the phagosome triggered the recruitment of the V-ATPase–ATG16L1 complex independently of FIP200, ATG13, and proton gradient disruption. Furthermore, the Ca 2+ leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation limited Mtb phagosome damage and restricted Mtb replication. Together, we uncovered Ca 2+ leakage as the key signal that triggers ATG8/LC3 lipidation on multiple membranes to mitigate Mtb phagosome damage.},

Halofuginone suppressed food intake, increased energy expenditure, and resulted in weight loss in diet-induced obese mice while also alleviating insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Using molecular and pharmacological tools with transcriptomics, we identified that halofuginone increases fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) levels via activating integrated stress response. Using Gdf15 and Fgf21 knockout mice, we show that both hormones are necessary to elicit anti-obesity changes.

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, subhertz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the SNSPD’s straight segments with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current crowding–free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: After irradiation with 800 ions nm −2 , locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37%, while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently. We achieve an internal detection efficiency of 94% with 7 mHz dark count rate near the onset of saturating detection efficiency for a wavelength of 780 nm.},

The bubble contained at the end of a micropipette and the surrounding liquid form a gas-liquid multiphase system susceptible to acoustic waves. Driven by a piezoelectric transducer, the oscillating gas-liquid interface induces acoustic microstreaming, markedly increasing the mass transfer efficiency. It enables multiple liquid micromanipulations, including mixing, dispersion, enhancing cell membrane permeability, and harvesting selected cells. Furthermore, a controllable three-dimensional axisymmetric vortex in an open environment overcomes the constraints of microfluidic chip, enabling stable trapping, rapid transportation, and multidirectional rotation of HeLa cells, embryos, and other bio-objects ranging from micrometers to millimeters. A variety of applications demonstrate that the μSonic-hand, with its wide-range capabilities, inherent biocompatibility, and extremely low cost could remarkably advance biomedical science.},

Using automated microinjection into apical progenitors (APs) of embryonic mouse neocortex and electroporation of APs in chimpanzee cerebral organoids, we show that NBPF14 promotes the delamination of AP progeny, by promoting oblique cleavage plane orientation during AP division, leading to increased abundance of the key basal progenitor type, basal radial glia. In contrast, NOTCH2NLB promotes AP proliferation, leading to expansion of the AP pool. When expressed together, NBPF14 and NOTCH2NLB exert coordinated effects, resulting in expansion of basal progenitors while maintaining self-renewal of APs. Hence, these two human-specific genes orchestrate the behavior of APs, and the lineages of their progeny, in a manner essential for the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex.},

One aspect of this debate is how Hadean zircons fit into an ultramafic environment. On the basis of experiments, thermodynamic modeling, and elemental partitioning, we show that felsic melts could have been generated by shallow interaction between primordial serpentinized peridotite and basaltic magmas on Earth and Mars. On the basis of the hafnium isotopic evolution of Hadean detrital zircons worldwide, we infer that these interactions allowed for the formation of extensive Hadean felsic crust (4.4 to 4.5 billion years ago), which, in turn, would account for up to 50% of the present continental crustal mass. A similar process may have occurred on Mars. The serpentinized protocrust had a dual role in the primitive planetary environment: to provide ingredients for the continental crust and to enable life to emerge on water-bearing terrestrial planets.},

The lamina underwent cycles of wrinkling and smoothing as the nucleus changed from an irregular, rounded shape in the wide channel regions between constrictions to a smooth, hourglass shape as the nucleus passed through the center of a constriction. The laminar surface area of nuclei within constrictions was measured to be at or above the computationally predicted threshold area for the nuclear volume. The channels excluded control nuclei that had insufficient excess surface area, but not nuclei lacking lamin A/C.

Our analysis shows that NAT10-dependent ac 4 C-acetylation is robust in rRNA and specific tRNAs but low/spurious in mRNA. It also revealed an inflammatory signature and mutagenesis at transcriptionally active sites in NAT10-KO cells. This finding led us to explore the role of NAT10 in R-loops, which were recently linked to APOBEC3B-mediated mutagenesis. Our analysis showed that R-loops are ac 4 C-acetylated in a NAT10-dependent manner. Furthermore, NAT10 restrains the levels of R-loops at a subset of differentially expressed genes in a catalytic activity–dependent manner. Together with cellular biology data showing ac 4 C-modified RNA in endosomal structures, we propose that increased levels of ac 4 C-unmodified RNAs, likely derived from R-loops, in endosomal structures induce inflammatory responses.},

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence has shown that epigenetic regulation plays a fundamental role in cancer metastasis, the major cause of cancer-related deaths. Here, we conducted an in vivo screen for vulnerabilities of brain metastasis and identified N -acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) as a driver of brain metastasis. Knockdown of NAT10 restrains cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. The poorly characterized RNA helicase domain of NAT10 is critical for cell growth in vitro, while both RNA helicase and NAT domains are essential for primary tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. Mechanically, NAT10 promotes the expression of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), two enzymes for serine biosynthesis implicated in brain metastasis. Silencing PHGDH or PSAT1 in metastatic breast cancer cells inhibits their growth in the serine/glycine-limited condition, phenocopying the effects of NAT10 depletion. These findings establish NAT10 as a key regulator of brain metastasis and nominate NAT10 as a target for treating metastasis.},

Current diagnostic imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging fail to characterize oxidative stress within atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce difuranfluoreno-dithiophen–based polymers designed for afterglow imaging, offering ultrabright luminescence, ultralow-power excitation (0.087 milliwatts per square centimeter), and ultrashort acquisition times (0.01 seconds). Through a molecular engineering strategy, we have optimized polymers for enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability, ROS capturing capability, and fluorescence quantum yield, resulting in an increase in afterglow intensity (~130-fold) compared to commonly used 2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene polymer (MEHPPV). Additionally, we have developed ratiometric afterglow nanoparticles doped with oxidative stress–responsive molecules, enabling imaging of oxidative stress markers in atherosclerotic plaque. This approach provides a tool for cardiovascular imaging and diagnostics, which is conducive to the auxiliary diagnosis and risk stratification of atherosclerosis.},

Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling and targeted in situ detection to identify Reln (encoding the secreted glycoprotein, Reelin) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal populations within the rat NAc. A CRISPR interference approach enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc altered expression of calcium signaling genes, promoted a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and decreased MSN excitability. Behaviorally, Reln knockdown prevented cocaine locomotor sensitization, abolished cocaine place preference memory, and decreased cocaine self-administration behavior.

HPB are widely present in the global environment, and their distribution follows a latitudinal diversity gradient. Climate and anthropogenic factors are identified as major drivers of the global distribution of HPB. Our predictions indicated that by the end of this century, the richness, abundance, and invasion risk of HPB will increase globally, with this upward trend becoming more pronounced as development sustainability declines.

At templated AP sites, cross-links between the DNA and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine binding, embryonic stem cell–specific (HMCES) regulate replication fork speed, avoiding cytotoxic double-strand breaks. While the role of HMCES at the template DNA strand is well studied, its effects on nascent DNA are not. We provide evidence that HMCES–DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are detrimental to the BER-mediated removal of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine (5hmdC)–derived 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine from replication forks. HRD cells have heightened HMCES-DPCs, which increase further upon 5hmdC exposure, suggesting that HMCES binds both spontaneous and 5hmdC-induced AP sites. HMCES depletion substantially suppresses 5hmdC-mediated replication fork defects, chromosomal aberrations, and cell death in HRD cells. This reveals that HMCES-DPCs are a source of BER-initiated single-stranded DNA gaps, which indicates that endogenous DPCs contribute to genomic instability in HRD tumors.},

Our previous research revealed that M2 macrophages transfected with magnetotactic bacteria–derived Mms6 gene can resist ferroptosis and enhance SCI recovery. To address the limitations of M2 macrophage transplantation, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating Mms6 mRNA targeting macrophages ( Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs). The targeting efficiency and therapeutic effect of these LNPs in SCI mice were evaluated. Intravenous administration of Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs delivered more Mms6 mRNAs to lesion-site macrophages than those in the Mms6 mRNA-LNP group, which resulted in enhancing motor function recovery, reducing lesion area and scar formation, and promoting neuronal survival and nerve fiber repair. These effects were nullified when macrophages were depleted. These findings suggest that macrophage-targeted delivery of Mms6 mRNA is a promising therapeutic strategy for promoting spinal cord repair and motor function recovery in patients with traumatic SCI.},

Previous research has established headcase as a fundamental gene for stress responses and survival of the Drosophila adult progenitor cells (APCs). However, the molecular role of Headcase has remained elusive. Here, we identify Headcase as a component of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. We also show that, Headcase is required for proper RNP granule formation and remodeling upon stress and is crucial for translation control. Likewise, the human Headcase homolog (HECA) is identified as a component of RNP granules and has similar roles in translational regulation and stress protection. Thus, Headcase proteins define a new family contributing to specific roles among the RNP heterogeneous network.},

The pathogenesis of F. oxysporum in plants is controlled by its circadian clock, with infections causing severe disease symptoms at dawn. Notably, disruption of clock genes dramatically reduces fungal pathogenicity. Circadian clocks regulate the rhythmic expression of several transcription factors, including FoZafA, which enables the pathogen to adapt to zinc starvation within the plant, and FoCzf1, which governs the production of the toxin fusaric acid. Together, our findings highlight the critical roles of circadian clocks in F. oxysporum pathogenicity by regulating zinc starvation response and secondary metabolite production.},

Here, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize neuromodulatory signals in the premotor cortex (medial M2) as mice engage in a competitive matching pennies game. Spatially, NE signals are more segregated with choice and outcome encoded at distinct locations, whereas ACh signals can multiplex and reflect different behavioral correlates at the same site.

Here, we generate a mutant mouse line with human W88C mutation (W88C Mut mice), which exhibits behavioral deficits similar to those observed in patients with TS, including repetitive motor behaviors and sensorimotor gating abnormalities. The W88C mutation leads to the degradation of kidney and brain (KIBRA) protein via a proteasomal pathway, evokes dopamine release in the dorsal striatum, and disrupts synaptic function through the dysregulation of Hippo pathway. Neuron-specific overexpression of wild-type WWC1 rescues synaptic and behavioral phenotypes in W88C Mut mice.

  abstract     = {Fossil assemblages exhibit a global depletion in taxonomic distinctiveness in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction (~252 million years ago), but little is known about why. Here, we examine whether biotic homogenization can be explained by tropical survivors tracking an expansion of their preferred habitat, measured in terms of the ratio of environmental oxygen supply to metabolic demand. We compare spatial similarity in community composition among marine invertebrate fossils represented by bivalve and gastropod fossils with predictions from an ecophysiological model of habitat that diagnoses areas in the ocean that can sustain the aerobic requirements of marine invertebrates. Modeled biogeographic responses to climate change yield an increase in global similarity of community composition among surviving ecophysiotypes, consistent with patterns in the fossil record and arguing for a physiological control on earliest Triassic biogeography.},

To enable x-ray–excited photodynamic therapy (XPDT) that targets deep-seated tumors, we synthesized a nanoscintillator-photosensitizer complex containing 5% Eu-doped Y 2 O 3 fluorescing at 611 nanometers and decorated with SiO 2 containing the scintillation-coupled photosensitizer methylene blue and a polyethylene glycol coating [PEGylated Y 2 O 3 :Eu@SiO 2 -methylene blue (pYSM)]. When irradiated, pYSMs generate singlet oxygen species in vitro, causing cytotoxicity with hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (calreticulin translocation to the cell membrane). Intravenously administered pYSMs home passively to pancreatic tumor xenografts and, upon 10 gray irradiation, cause significant tumor regression ( P &lt; 0.01). On combining XPDT with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, a distant nonirradiated tumor also regresses via an increase in intratumoral activated CD8 + cytotoxic T cells. Collectively, we advance a systemically delivered XPDT strategy that mediates an antitumor effect in both irradiated and nonirradiated (abscopal) tumors when coupled with immunotherapy, converting an immunologically “cold” tumor to an immunologically “hot” tumor.},

Some exploit background motion to hide while hunting, and others may use coloration and behavior to generate motion noise that impairs detection or recognition. Here, we uncover a unique form of motion camouflage, showing that broadclub cuttlefish pass dark stripes downward across their head and arms to disguise their hunting maneuvers. This “passing-stripe” display reduces the probability of response to predatory expanding stimuli by prey crabs in a lab-based experiment, is modulated according to approach speed during a hunt, and generates a motion pattern that is different from that of looming predators. This form of motion camouflage likely functions by overwhelming the threatening motion of the approaching predator with nonthreatening downward motion generated by the rhythmic stripes.},

The gold standard, 2-[ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, is limited by radioactive exposure and sparse assessment of metabolism beyond glucose uptake and retention. Deuterium magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) with [6,6- 2 H 2 ]glucose is nonradioactive, achieves tumor metabolic contrast, but can be improved by enriched contrast from deuterated water (HDO) based imaging. Here, we developed a DMRI protocol employing [ 2 H 7 ]glucose. Imaging 2 H-signal and measuring HDO production in tumor-bearing mice detected differential glucose utilization across baseline tumors, tumors treated with vehicle control or anti-glycolytic BRAFi and MEKi therapy, and contralateral healthy tissue. Control tumors generated the most 2 H-signal and HDO. To our knowledge this is the first application of DMRI with [ 2 H 7 ]glucose for tumoral treatment monitoring. This approach demonstrates HDO as a marker of tumor glucose utilization and suggests translational capability in humans due to its safety, noninvasiveness, and suitability for serial monitoring.},

Here, we report a unified PUF and TRNG chip based on a 28-nanometer embedded memristor with concealable ability. We use the memristor intrinsic FORMING condition variation and read current variation as entropy sources and design a compact on-chip entropy extractor that achieves a high throughput of 41.7 megabits per second with minimal area overhead of 0.291 MF 2 . To prevent PUF data leakage, we developed a concealment method, protecting data when idle and enabling recovery upon demand. Comprehensive testing shows the chip has excellent performance in randomness, reliability, lifetime, and stability, achieving a 3.82-fold throughput improvement over complementary metal-oxide semiconductor–based designs in authentication tasks.},

We explore peptide nucleic acid (PNA) as a candidate for a genetic-like polymer in a hypothetical sulfuric acid biochemistry. PNA hexamers undergo between 0.4 and 28.6% degradation in 98% (w/w) sulfuric acid at ~25°C, over the span of 14 days, depending on the sequence, but undergo complete solvolysis above 80°C.

A subset of these cancers, which we term as “RBness,” lack RB1 genomic defects and yet phenocopy the transcriptional profile of RB1 -defective cancers. We report RBness as a pan-cancer phenomenon, associated with patient outcome and chemotherapy response in multiple cancer types, and predictive of CDK4/6 inhibitor response in estrogen-positive breast cancer. Using RNA interference and a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in isogenic models, we find that RBness cancers also phenocopy synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cells with RB1 genomic defects. In summary, our findings suggest that dysregulation of the RB pathway in cancers lacking RB1 genomic defects provides a molecular rationale for how these cancers could be treated.},

In this study, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models in chest x-ray diagnosis across five globally sourced datasets. Our findings reveal that compared to board-certified radiologists, these foundation models consistently underdiagnose marginalized groups, with even higher rates seen in intersectional subgroups such as Black female patients. Such biases present over a wide range of pathologies and demographic attributes. Further analysis of the model embedding uncovers its substantial encoding of demographic information. Deploying medical AI systems with biases can intensify preexisting care disparities, posing potential challenges to equitable healthcare access and raising ethical questions about their clinical applications.},

Model simulations show that the combined impact of mobile bottom-contact fishing (e.g., trawling) and dredging reduces natural alkalinity generation by 60 to 220 gigaequivalent year −1 , which is equivalent to a reduction of the natural marine carbon sink by 2 to 8 teragrams CO 2 year −1 . Alkalinity destruction by anthropogenic seafloor disturbance hence generates a hidden CO 2 emission, of which the impact is comparable to the estimated reduction of organic carbon burial by mobile bottom-contact fishing. Our analysis emphasizes that carbon accounting in marine systems should consider the anthropogenic impact on both the organic and inorganic carbon cycles.},

AS3MT d2d3 -Tg mice exhibited enlarged ventricles and deficits in sensorimotor gating and sociability. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses of AS3MT d2d3 -Tg brains revealed cell fate imbalances and altered excitatory neuron composition. AS3MT d2d3 localized to centrosome, disrupting mitotic spindle orientation and differentiation in developing neocortex and organoids, in part through NPM1 (Nucleophosmin 1). The structural analysis identified that hydrophobic residues exposed in AS3MT d2d3 are critical for its pathogenic function.

Here, we show that Ephexin5 activates both RhoA and Cdc42 in the brain. Furthermore, using live imaging of GTPase biosensors, we demonstrate that Ephexin5 regulates activity-dependent Cdc42, but not RhoA, signaling at single synapses. The selectivity of Ephexin5 for Cdc42 activation is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is regulated by neuronal activity. Last, in contrast to Ephexin5’s role in negatively regulating synapse density, we show that, downstream of neuronal activity, Ephexin5 positively regulates synaptic growth and stabilization. Our results support a model in which plasticity-inducing neuronal activity regulates Ephexin5 tyrosine phosphorylation, driving Ephexin5-mediated activation of Cdc42 and the spine structural growth and stabilization vital for learning.},

When salt water overlays permafrost, Rayleigh-Darcy (R-D) instability emerges because of the density mismatch and regulates melting (thawing) dynamics. Contrary to expectations that a higher Rayleigh number ( R ) would amplify instability, our experiments revealed fingering and stable melting fronts at low and high R , respectively. We attribute the occurrence of the two melting patterns to the interplay between two competing flow structures: local circumfluence modulated by front perturbation and transversal chaotic mixing. We propose theories that rationalize the melting pattern transition and finger-scale evolution. In addition, the classic mass transport theory for R-D convection drastically underestimates the melting rate and misses key variable(s). The presence of fingering patterns and accelerated dynamics may have led to earlier penetration of the permafrost layer than previously anticipated. These findings have implications for understanding similar processes in magma migration, carbon sequestration, and subsurface energy recovery.},

On Jupiter, the presence of water has been invoked to control the occurrence of large-scale storms; however, the impact of storms on the ammonia and temperature distribution is unknown. We use Juno Microwave Radiometer observations of a large-scale storm in 2017 to study the aftermath of such a storm on the atmosphere. Anomalies in the retrieved ammonia abundance and atmospheric temperature show how storms deplete and heat the upper atmosphere while simultaneously depositing material well below the layers they were triggered at. These observations, aided by simulations, show that the water and ammonia cycles are coupled and that their combined effect plays a key role in explaining the depletion of ammonia in the tropospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.},

  abstract     = {Relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (rrAML) is a malignant blood cancer with an extremely poor prognosis, largely ascribed to the drug-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Most patients suffer from a risk of difficult-to-cure as well as severe systemic toxicity when receiving standard chemotherapies. As hyaluronic acid (HA) is a specific ligand of CD44 highly expressed by LSCs, we had HA self-assembled with cisplatin and daunorubicin to form a dual chemodrug nanogel (HA/Cis/Dau) to afford the targeted therapeutic interventions of rrAML. HA/Cis/Dau displayed an extra therapeutic function of inducing the granulocyte-monocyte differentiation in CD44 + rrAML cells, an rrAML mouse model, and primary blasts isolated from patients with AML. Unlike free drugs directly diffusing and killing rrAML cells, HA/Cis/Dau transported the drugs into lysosomes, causing lysosomal membrane permeabilization, ROS accumulation, and thus a metabolic reprogramming of the rrAML cells. Moreover, HA/Cis/Dau was featured with alleviated side effects, ease of preparation, and cost effectiveness, therefore holding great promises for the targeted treatment of rrAML.},

  abstract     = {Most advances in early human postimplantation development depend on animal studies and stem cell–based embryo models. Here, we present self-organized three-dimensional human gastruloids (hGs) derived from embryonic stem cells. The transcriptome profile of day 3 hGs aligned with Carnegie stage 7 human gastrula, with cell types and differentiation trajectories consistent with human gastrulation. Notably, we observed the emergence of nascent primordial germ cell–like cells (PGCLCs), but without exogenous bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is essential for the PGCLC fate. A mutation in the ISL1 gene affects amnion-like cells and leads to a loss of PGCLCs; the addition of exogenous BMP2 rescues the PGCLC fate, indicating that the amnion may provide endogenous BMP signaling. Our model of early human embryogenesis will enable further exploration of the germ line and other early human lineages.},

  abstract     = {Thermalization, while ubiquitous in physics, has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to be mitigated. In contrast, we demonstrate here the use of thermalization in the generation, control, and readout of “shell-like” spin textures with interacting 13 C nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The textures span several nanometers and encompass many hundred spins; they are created and interrogated without manipulating the nuclear spins individually. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-engineered Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field: The texture is therefore metastable and robust against spin diffusion. This enables the state to endure over multiple minutes before it decays. Our work on spin-state engineering paves the way for applications in quantum simulation and nanoscale imaging.},
