  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) control many physiological processes and are important pharmacological targets. Luebbers et al. developed an optical biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that directly measures the endogenous activation of Gα i subunits in response to GPCR stimulation in both cell lines and mouse astrocytes. In a neuronal cell line, experiments with Gα i bONE-GO revealed that several neuropeptides classified as full agonists of opioid receptors instead behaved as partial agonists. Unlike biosensors typically used to measure GPCR activation, Gα i bONE-GO does not depend on exogenously expressed receptors or G proteins and can be deployed in many cell types using a single expression construct. —Annalisa M. VanHook The activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) by G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a mechanism broadly used by eukaryotes to transduce signals across the plasma membrane and a target for many clinical drugs. Many optical biosensors commonly used for measuring GPCR-stimulated G protein activity rely on exogenously expressed GPCRs and/or G proteins, which compromise readout fidelity. Biosensors that measure endogenous signaling may interfere with the signaling process under investigation or have a limited dynamic range of detection, hindering applicability. Here, we developed an optical BRET-based biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that detects endogenous GTP-bound (active) Gα i upon stimulation of endogenous GPCRs more robustly than existing sensors of endogenous activity. Its design leverages the Gα i -binding protein GINIP as a high-affinity and specific detector of Gα i -GTP. We optimized this design to prevent interference with downstream G i -dependent signaling and to enable implementation in different experimental systems having endogenous GPCRs, including adenosine receptors in primary astroglial cells and opioid receptors in cell lines. In a neuronal cell line, Gα i bONE-GO revealed activation profiles indicating that several natural opioid neuropeptides acted as partial agonists, in contrast with their characterization as full agonists using biosensors that depend on exogenously expressed receptors and G proteins. The Gα i bONE-GO biosensor is a direct and sensitive detector of endogenous activation of Gα i proteins by GPCRs in different experimental settings but does not interfere with the subsequent propagation of signaling.},

  abstract     = {Many cancers suppress immune surveillance and resist immune-targeted therapies. Chen et al. found that antitumor immunity and treatment might be improved by harnessing an antibody associated with the autoimmune disease lupus. The antibody, called 4H2, was taken up into cells where it bound to endogenous (“self”) RNA to recruit and activate the nucleic acid sensor cGAS, which initiated inflammatory signaling that was cytotoxic to brain, lung, and breast cancer cells in culture but not to normal breast epithelial cells. In mice with glioblastomas, 4H2 localized to the tumor microenvironment after systemic administration, improved animal survival in a T cell–dependent manner, and improved the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, demonstrating its potential for treating patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Nucleic acid–mediated signaling triggers an immune response that is believed to be central to the pathophysiology of autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we found that a cell-penetrating, SLE-associated antiguanosine autoantibody may present therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment. The autoantibody entered cells through a nucleoside salvage-linked pathway of membrane transit that avoids endosomes and lysosomes and bound to endogenous RNA in live cells. In orthotopic models of glioblastoma, the antibody localized to areas adjacent to necrotic tumor cells and promoted animal survival in a manner that depended on T cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that antibody binding to nucleic acids activated the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), thereby stimulating immune signaling and cGAS-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, the autoantibody could carry and deliver functional RNA into tumor, brain, and muscle tissues in live mice when administered locally. The findings establish a collaborative autoantibody–nucleic acid interaction that is translatable to strategies for nonviral gene delivery and immunotherapy.},
