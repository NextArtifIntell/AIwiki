  abstract     = {Torque and continuous rotation are fundamental methods of actuation and manipulation in rigid robots. Soft robot arms use soft materials and structures to mimic the passive compliance of biological arms that bend and extend. This use of compliance prevents soft arms from continuously transmitting and exerting torques to interact with their environment. Here, we show how relying on patterning structures instead of inherent material properties allows soft robotic arms to remain compliant while continuously transmitting torque to their environment. We demonstrate a soft robotic arm made from a pair of mechanical metamaterials that act as compliant constant-velocity joints. The joints are up to 52 times stiffer in torsion than bending and can bend up to 45°. This robot arm continuously transmits torque while remaining flexible in all other directions. The arm’s mechanical design achieves high motion repeatability (0.4 millimeters and 0.1°) when tracking trajectories. We then trained a neural network to learn the inverse kinematics, enabling us to program the arm to complete tasks that are challenging for existing soft robots, such as installing light bulbs, fastening bolts, and turning valves. The arm’s passive compliance makes it safe around humans and provides a source of mechanical intelligence, enabling it to adapt to misalignment when manipulating objects. This work will bridge the gap between hard and soft robotics with applications in human assistance, warehouse automation, and extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic fields enable remote manipulation of objects and are ideal for medical applications because they pass through human tissue harmlessly. This capability is promising for surgical robots, allowing navigation deeper into the human anatomy and accessing organs beyond the reach of current technologies. However, magnetic manipulation is typically limited to a maximum two–degrees-of-freedom orientation, restricting complex motions, especially those including rolling around the main axis of the magnetic robot. To address this challenge, we introduce a robot design inspired by embodied intelligence and the unique geometry of developable rollers, leveraging the oloid shape. The oloid, with its axial asymmetry and sinusoidal motion, facilitates rolling when precisely controlled by an external magnetic field. We present a versatile closed-loop control model to ensure precise magnetic manipulation of an oloid-shaped robot. This capability was validated in endoluminal applications through the integration of a 28-megahertz micro-ultrasound array to perform virtual biopsies, noninvasive real-time histological imaging. Extensive in vitro and in vivo tests using a porcine model showed the robot’s ability to execute sweeping motions, identify lesions, and generate detailed three-dimensional scans of gastrointestinal subsurface tissue. This research not only restores a critical movement capability to magnetic medical robots but also enables additional clinical applications deep within the human body.},

  abstract     = {Locomotors traversing arboreal environments must often leap across large gaps to land on small-diameter supports. Balancing these dynamic landings is challenging because of high incident momentum, restricted foothold options, and reduced capacity to produce reaction torques on narrow supports. We hypothesized that leg length control to enhance branch reaction control authority would markedly expand the range of successful landing conditions, drawing on the same powerful leg actuation required for leaping. Exploring this balance strategy, the monopedal robot Salto-1P demonstrates branch-to-branch leaps, including some upright balanced landings, despite negligible grasping torque. We also compared this landing strategy with the landings of squirrels, which similarly lack the grip strength found in other arboreal species. We demonstrate that greater radial force control reduces the inertial body torque and/or grasping torque at the support required to balance a given landing. Adding simple radial force balance control strategies to conventional balance controllers greatly expands potential landing conditions, increasing the range of initial angular momentum that can be balanced by 230 and 470% across ranges of landing angles for low-order models of the robot and squirrel, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Research on miniature deep-sea robots is an emerging field focused on the development of deployable, compact devices capable of interacting with the unique environments and organisms of the deep ocean. In this study, we present a design strategy for a centimeter-scale deep-sea soft actuator, weighing 16 grams, that incorporates bistable chiral metamaterials and tube-sealed shape memory alloys. According to our design, the increased modulus induced by the hydrostatic pressure was used to achieve a higher snapping velocity of the bistable chiral unit, thus lifting the actuator’s performance. We showed that the actuator can produce undistorted cyclic motions at various depths in the deep sea. Subsequently, we developed an untethered miniature deep-sea robot that is capable of multimodal locomotion by repurposing its legs and fins. To validate the robot’s performance, this miniature robot was deployed from deep-sea crewed submersibles, performing swimming, gliding, morphing, and crawling in the Haima Cold Seep (1380-meter depth) and the Mariana Trench (10,600-meter depth); it was then retrieved by the submersible fully intact. The actuation module design enabled the robot to perform comparably in the Haima Cold Seep and laboratory aquarium conditions (atmospheric pressure). Additionally, we developed a wearable soft gripper based on the same metamaterial design strategy to facilitate safe deep-sea operations, ranging from soft-specimen collection to heavy-object manipulation (~3400-meter depth). This study offers design insights into creating next-generation miniature deep-sea actuators and robots, paving the way for future exploration and interaction with deep-sea ecosystems.},

However, people with paralysis cannot generate sufficient activity during robot-assisted rehabilitation and, consequently, do not benefit from these therapies. Here, we developed an implantable spinal cord neuroprosthesis operating in a closed loop to promote robust activity during walking and cycling assisted by robotic devices. This neuroprosthesis is device agnostic and designed for seamless implementation by nonexpert users. Preliminary evaluations in participants with paralysis showed that the neuroprosthesis enabled well-organized patterns of muscle activity during robot-assisted walking and cycling. A proof-of-concept study suggested that robot-assisted rehabilitation augmented by the neuroprosthesis promoted sustained neurological improvements. Moreover, the neuroprosthesis augmented recreational walking and cycling activities outdoors. Future clinical trials will have to confirm these findings in a broader population.},

  abstract     = {Operating in the brain for deep-seated tumors or surgical targets for epilepsy is technically demanding and normally requires a large craniotomy with its attendant risk and morbidity. Neuroendoscopic surgery has the potential to reduce risk and morbidity by permitting surgical access through a small incision with burr hole and a narrow corridor through the brain. However, current endoscopic neurosurgical tools are straight and rigid and lack dexterity, hindering their adoption for neuroendoscopic procedures. We propose a class of robotic neurosurgical tools that have magnetically actuated wristed end effectors small enough to fit through a neuroendoscope working channel. The tools were less than 3.2 millimeters in overall diameter and contained embedded permanent magnets that allowed wireless actuation with magnetic fields. Three magnetic tools are presented: a two–degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) wristed gripper, a one-DoF pivoting scalpel, and a one-DoF twisted string–actuated forceps. This work evaluated the feasibility of these tools for completing minimally invasive neurosurgical resection and cutting tasks. Experimental tests on a silicone brain phantom showed that the tools could reach the ventricle area for simulated tumor removal and access a section of the corpus callosotomy for a simulated tissue-severing procedure in epilepsy treatment. Integration of the magnetic end effectors with a concentric tube robot as a hybrid steerable surgical robotic system enabled in vivo experiments on piglets. These experiments show that wireless magnetic tools could perform essential neurosurgical tasks, including gripping, cutting, and biopsy on living brain tissue, suggesting their potential for clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {The integration of social robots into family environments raises critical questions about their long-term influence on family interactions. This study explores the potential of social robots as conversational catalysts in human-human dyadic interaction, focusing on enhancing high-quality, reciprocal conversations between parents and children during dialogic coreading activities. With the increasing prevalence of social robots in homes and the recognized importance of parent-child exchanges for children’s developmental milestones, this work presents a comprehensive empirical investigation involving more than 70 parent-child dyads over a period of 1 to 2 months. We examined the effects of three robot interaction styles—a passive robot listener, an active robot with a fixed behavior strategy, and an active robot with a strategy-switching mechanism—on parent-child conversational dynamics. Our findings reveal that a robot’s active participation enhances the quality of parent-child dialogic conversations. The influence of robot facilitation varied on the basis of parental English proficiency. Strategy-switching robots provided greater benefits to non–native English–speaking families, whereas dyads with native English–speaking parents benefited more from fixed-strategy robots. Overall, this study highlights the promise of social robots that empower parents in fostering their children’s dialogic development—a contrast with the prevalent design of educational robots that primarily target children. It provides critical insights into the equitable, nuanced design of long-term family-robot interactions at home, especially in supporting diverse family backgrounds.},
