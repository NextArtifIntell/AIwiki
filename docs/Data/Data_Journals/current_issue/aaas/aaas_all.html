  abstract     = {Recently, light-matter interaction has been vastly expanded as a control tool for inducing and enhancing many emergent nonequilibrium phenomena. However, conventional schemes for exploring such light-induced phenomena rely on uniform and diffraction-limited free-space optics, which limits the spatial resolution and the efficiency of light-matter interaction. Here, we overcome these challenges using metasurface plasmon polaritons (MPPs) to form a sub-wavelength optical lattice. Specifically, we report a “nonlocal” pump-probe scheme where MPPs are excited to induce a spatially modulated AC Stark shift for excitons in a monolayer of MoSe 2 , several microns away from the illumination spot. We identify nearly two orders of magnitude reduction for the required modulation power compared to the free-space optical illumination counterpart. Moreover, we demonstrate a broadening of the excitons’ linewidth as a robust signature of MPP-induced periodic sub-diffraction modulation. Our results will allow exploring power-efficient light-induced lattice phenomena below the diffraction limit in active chip-compatible MPP architectures.},

In this work, we curate a peptide assembly database through a combination of manual processing by human experts and large language model–assisted literature mining. As a result, we collect over 1000 experimental data entries with information about peptide sequence, experimental conditions, and corresponding self-assembly phases. Using the data, machine learning models are developed, demonstrating excellent accuracy (&gt;80%) in assembly phase classification. Moreover, we fine-tune a GPT model for peptide literature mining with the developed dataset, which markedly outperforms the pretrained model in extracting information from academic publications. This workflow can improve efficiency when exploring potential self-assembling peptide candidates, through guiding experimental work, while also deepening our understanding of the governing mechanisms.},

Understanding physical differences between euchromatin and heterochromatin is crucial, yet specific labeling methods in living cells remain limited. Here, we have developed replication-dependent histone (Repli-Histo) labeling to mark nucleosomes in euchromatin and heterochromatin based on DNA replication timing. Using this approach, we investigated local nucleosome motion in the four known chromatin classes, from euchromatin to heterochromatin, of living human and mouse cells. The more euchromatic (earlier-replicated) and more heterochromatic (later-replicated) regions exhibit greater and lesser nucleosome motions, respectively. Notably, the motion profile in each chromatin class persists throughout interphase. Genome chromatin is essentially replicated from regions with greater nucleosome motions, although the replication timing is perturbed. Our findings, combined with computational modeling, suggest that earlier-replicated regions have more accessibility, and local chromatin motion can be a major determinant of genome-wide replication timing.},

DNMT3B is intricately regulated by histone H3 modifications, yet the dynamic interplay between DNMT3B and histone modifications remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the PWWP (proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline) domain within DNMT3B exhibits remarkable dynamics that enhances the enzyme’s methyltransferase activity upon interactions with a modified histone H3 peptide (H3K4 me0 K36 me3 ). In the presence of H3K4 me0 K36 me3 , both the PWWP and ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L) domains transition from autoinhibitory to active conformations. In this active state, the PWWP domain most often aligns closely with the catalytic domain, allowing for simultaneous interactions with H3 and DNA to stimulate DNA methylation. The prostate cancer–associated DNMT3B R545C mutant is even more dynamic and susceptible to adopting the active conformation, resulting in aberrant DNA hypermethylation. Our study suggests the mechanism by which conformational rearrangements in DNMT3B are triggered by histone modifications, ultimately unleashing its activity in DNA methylation.},

It is present in Africa, Europe, Asia, and in the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. There are no effective treatments or broadly licensed vaccines to prevent disease. Efforts to counteract ASF have been hampered because of the lack of convenient tools to engineer its etiological agent, ASF virus (ASFV), largely due to its large noninfectious genome. Here, we report the use of synthetic genomics methodology to develop a reverse genetics system for ASFV using a CRISPR-Cas9–inhibited self-helper virus to reconstitute live recombinant ASFV from synthetic genomes to rapidly generate a variety of combinatorial mutants of ASFV. The method will substantially facilitate the development of therapeutics or subunit and live-attenuated vaccines for ASF. This synthetic genomics-based approach has wide-ranging impact because it can be applied to rapidly develop reverse genetics tools for emerging viruses with noninfectious genomes.},

OpenCRISPR-1 is a CRISPR system synthesized de novo using large language models (LLMs) but has not yet undergone systematic characterization. Using AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq, we assessed the on-target activity and off-target profiles of these systems across multiple genomic loci. FrCas9 demonstrated higher on-target efficiency and substantially fewer off-target effects than SpCas9 and OpenCRISPR-1. Furthermore, TREX2 fusion with FrCas9 reduced large deletions and translocations, enhancing genomic stability. Through screening of 1903 sgRNAs targeting 21 CGT-relevant genes using sequential AID-seq, Amplicon sequencing, and GUIDE-seq analysis, we identified optimal sgRNAs for each gene. Our high-throughput screening platform highlights FrCas9, particularly in its TREX2-fused form, as a highly specific and efficient tool for precise therapeutic genome editing.},

We investigated associations between steroid levels and biological sex, age, clinical and demographic data, genetics, and plasma proteomics. Steroid hormone levels were strongly affected by sex and age, and a high number of lifestyle habits. Key observations were the broad impact of hormonal birth control in female donors and the relationship with smoking in male donors. In a 10-year follow-up study, we identified significant associations between steroid hormone levels and health status only in male donors.

Here, we demonstrate quantum storage of photonic qubits for 1.021 milliseconds based on a laser-written optical waveguide fabricated in a 151 Eu 3+ :Y 2 SiO 5 crystal. Spin dephasing of 151 Eu 3+ is mitigated through dynamical decoupling applied via on-chip electric waveguides, and we obtain a storage efficiency of 12.0 ± 0.5% at 1.021 milliseconds, which is a demonstration of integrated quantum memories that outperforms the efficiency of a simple fiber delay line. Such long-lived waveguide-based quantum memory could support applications in quantum repeaters, and further combination with critical magnetic fields could enable potential application as transportable quantum memories.},

This phosphorylation stabilizes Toc33 by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Constitutive triple response 1 (CTR1), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling, and its paralog RAF-like kinase are involved in phosphorylating Toc33. Disruption of Toc33 phosphorylation impairs its stability and photosynthetic protein import, consequently affecting chloroplast structural integrity and biogenesis. Our findings underscore the essential role of TOC phosphorylation in chloroplast biogenesis and reveal an unexpected regulatory network involving RAF-like kinases in organelle development.},

Emerging data from human studies and epidemiological models suggest that increased divergence in contemporary viruses may drive differential cross-protection, where infection with Yamagata lineage viruses provides limited immunity against Victoria lineage viruses. Here, we developed animal models to investigate the mechanisms behind asymmetric cross-protection between contemporary FLUBV lineages. Our results show that contemporary Victoria immunity provides robust cross-protection against the Yamagata lineage, whereas Yamagata immunity offers limited protection against the Victoria lineage. This differential cross-protection is driven by Victoria-elicited neuraminidase (NA)–specific antibodies, which show cross-lineage reactivity, unlike those from Yamagata infections. These findings identify a phenomenon in contemporary FLUBV that may help explain the recent disappearance of the Yamagata lineage from circulation, highlighting the crucial role of targeting NA in vaccination strategies to enhance cross-lineage FLUBV protection.},

Using a combination of atmospheric reanalysis, satellite data, and hydrologic modeling, we overcame key limitations typical of data-scarce, high-variability regions and revealed that despite the catastrophic impact, the return periods of the rainfall and flood were only a few decades. Hydraulic simulations revealed that the dam failures amplified the damage nearly 20-fold compared to a dam-free scenario.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in wearable sweat sensors, which use standardized electrochemical and colorimetric mechanisms, offer holistic representation of health status for users. However, the constraints of standardized sweat sensors present ongoing challenges to realization of personalized health management. This study presents an electrocolorimetric (EC) platform that enables the reversible and multiple-time use of colorimetric data visualization using electrophoretic display (EPD). This platform represents the application of low-power EPD in epidermal sweat sensor, evaluated through CIELAB-based methodology which is the first systematic evaluation tool of wearable display performance. Moreover, our platform has been demonstrated in human exercise trials for its ability to detect the lactate threshold (LT). This digital colorimetric system has the potential to play a pivotal role by integrating various health monitoring biomarkers. While providing real-time, continuous, and adjustable range information with high sensitivity, this platform validates its extensive probability as a next-generation wearable epidermal sensor.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic dysregulation represents one of the major driving forces in aging. Although multiple genetic and pharmacological manipulations are known to extend longevity in model organisms, aging is a complex trait, and targeting one’s own genes may be insufficient to prevent age-dependent deterioration. An alternative strategy could be to use enzymes from other species to reverse age-associated metabolic changes. In this review, we discuss a set of enzymes from lower organisms that have been shown to affect various metabolic parameters linked to age-related processes. These enzymes include modulators of steady-state levels of amino acids (METase, ASNase, and ADI), NADPH/NADP + and/or reduced form of coenzyme Q (CoQH 2 )/CoQ redox potentials (NDI1, AOX, Lb NOX, TPNOX, Ec STH, RquA, LOXCAT, Grubraw, and ScURA), GSH (StGshF), mitochondrial membrane potential (mtON and mito-dR), or reactive oxygen species (DAAO and KillerRed-SOD1). We propose that leveraging non-mammalian enzymes represents an untapped resource that can be used to delay aging and age-related diseases.},

To mitigate such escape, we preemptively enhance AZD3152, an antibody authorized for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, we identify AZD3152 vulnerabilities at antigen positions F456 and D420. Through two iterations of computational antibody design that integrates structure-based modeling, machine-learning, and experimental validation, we co-optimize AZD3152 against 24 contemporary and previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as 20 potential future escape variants. Our top candidate, 3152-1142, restores full potency (100-fold improvement) against the more recently emerged XBB.1.5+F456L variant that escaped AZD3152, maintains potency against previous variants of concern, and shows no additional vulnerability as assessed by DMS. This preemptive mitigation demonstrates a generalizable approach for optimizing existing antibodies against potential future viral escape.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of compressed atomic-type hydrides offers a promising avenue toward achieving room-temperature superconductivity, but it necessitates extremely high pressures to completely dissociate hydrogen molecules to release free electrons. Here, we report a remarkable finding of compressed H 2 -molecular–type hydride CaH 14 exhibiting an unusual transition temperature ( T c ) of 204.0 kelvin. The peculiarity of its electronic structure lies in the pronounced emergence of near-free electrons, which manifest metallic bonding, but molecular hydrogen fragments persist. This finding indicates that the necessary condition for superconducting transition is forming the Fermi sea with Cooper pairs rather than the monatomic hydrogen. Notably, the formation mechanism of free electrons can be effectively explained by the finite-depth potential wells model. Intriguingly, this H 2 -molecular–type hydride can downgrade the required pressure to 80 gigapascal while maintaining a high T c of 84 kelvin, well above the liquid-nitrogen temperature. Our study has established a high-temperature superconducting paradigm and opened the prospect for achieving high- T c superconductors in H 2 -molecular–type hydrides at low pressure.},

In view of clinical translation of dual AAV intein vectors, here we set to evaluate both the efficiency and safety of their subretinal administration in relevant large animal models. Accordingly, we have developed the first pig model of STGD1, which we found to accumulate lipofuscin similarly to patients. This accumulation is significantly reduced upon subretinal administration of dual AAV intein vectors whose safety and pharmacodynamics we then tested in nonhuman primates, which showed modest and reversible inflammation as well as high levels of photoreceptor transduction. This bodes well for further clinical translation of dual AAV intein vectors in patients with STGD1 as well as for other blinding diseases that require the delivery of large genes.},

Alternative pathways (APs) have been designed to relocate the decarboxylation step or even fix additional carbon. To improve the success of transferring those engineered APs from model species to crops, we must understand how they will interact with metabolism and how plant physiology affects their performance. Here, we used multiple mathematical modeling techniques to analyze and compare existing AP designs. We show that carbon-fixing APs are the most promising candidates to replace native photorespiration in major crop species. Our results demonstrate the different metabolic routes that APs use to increase yield and which plant physiology can profit the most from them. We anticipate our results to guide the design of new APs and to help improve existing ones.},

Inspired by Parthenocissus , we propose a growing-climbing mechanism and report a soft climbing robot, which grows microstructured biofilms to enhance adhesion, similar to Parthenocissus growing suckers and adsorbing to the wall. The robot uses shape memory alloy contraction to achieve bending, similar to Parthenocissus using gelatinous fibers contraction to achieve hinge-like bending. In addition, to not damage the site, it can be fully contracted after completing tasks. The climbing robot can climb on various complex surfaces, especially discontinuous surfaces, verifying the effectiveness of Parthenocissus ’ growing-climbing mechanism.

The answer is yes, and trilayer goldene is the magic number, for reasons of electronegativity. Experiments are made to synthesize the atomically laminated phase Ti 4 Au 3 C 3 through substitutional intercalation of Si layers in Ti 4 SiC 3 for Au. Density functional theory calculations suggest that it is energetically favorable to insert three layers of Au into Ti 4 SiC 3 , compared to inserting a monolayer, a bilayer, or more than three layers. Isolated trilayer goldene sheets, ~100 nanometers wide and 6.7 angstroms thick, were obtained by chemically etching the Ti 4 C 3 layers from Ti 4 Au 3 C 3 templates. Furthermore, trilayer goldene is found in both hcp and fcc forms, where the hcp is ~50 milli–electron volts per atom more stable at room temperature from ab initio molecular dynamic simulations.},

This system leverages bacterial tropism to enhance macrophage infiltration and polarization. The low oxygen levels trigger in situ aCD47 expression, blocking the “do not eat me” signal and boosting macrophage antitumor activity.

Cross-[4+2] cycloadditions offer greater product diversity than traditional diene-dienophile reactions due to multiple possible pathways. However, precise control over regio- and stereoselectivity for various isomers remains a great challenge. This study reports catalyst-controlled regiodivergent formal cross-cycloadditions of acyclic dienes and enones, significantly enhancing access to diverse pyrazole-fused spirooxindoles. Chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis enables endoselective [4+2] cycloadditions, while Bi(III) with a CPA ligand yields [2+4] products with high regio- and stereoselectivity. A Claisen rearrangement of the [2+4] adduct produces the exo-selective [4+2] product, further increasing stereochemical diversity and enabling the synthesis of six regio- and stereo-isomers from a single substrate set. DFT calculations reveal that Bi(III) reverses regioselectivity by repositioning reactants in the CPA pocket and stabilizing the enone oxygen’s negative charge. In addition, product 3as demonstrates therapeutic potential against triple-negative breast cancer, with an IC 50 of 8.5 μM in MDA-MB-453 cells.},

Here, we present a scalable nanofabrication technique that combines bottom-up and top-down approaches for selective growth of 3D DNA superlattices on gold microarrays. This approach allows for the fabrication of self-assembled 3D-nanostructured electronic devices. DNA strands are bound onto the gold arrays, which anchor DNA origami frames and promote ordered framework growth on the specific areas of the surface, enabling control of the lateral placement and orientation of superlattices. DNA frameworks selectively grown on the pads are subsequently templated to nanoscale silica and tin oxide (SnO x ) that follow the architecture, as confirmed by structural and chemical characterizations. The fabricated SnO x superlattices are integrated into devices that demonstrate photocurrent response.},

  abstract     = {Pioneer transcription factors (TFs) initiate chromatin remodeling, which is crucial for gene regulation and cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated how the sequential expression of neurogenin 3 (NGN3) and NEUROD1 affects their pioneering functions during pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we mapped NGN3-binding sites, confirming the pivotal role of this molecule in regulating chromatin accessibility. The pioneering function of NGN3 involves dose tolerance, and low doses are sufficient. Although NEUROD1 generally acts as a conventional TF, it can assume a pioneering role in the absence of NGN3. The sequential expression of NeuroD1 and Ngn3 predominantly drives α cell generation, which may explain the inefficient β cell induction observed in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that pioneer activity is dynamically shaped by temporal TF expression and inter-TF interactions, providing insights into transcriptional regulation and its implications for disease mechanisms and therapeutic targeting and enhancing in vitro differentiation strategies.},

Here, we found that Ca 2+ leakage after Mtb phagosome damage in human macrophages is the signal that triggers autophagy-related protein 8/microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (ATG8/LC3) lipidation. Unexpectedly, ATG8/LC3 lipidation did not target Mtb to lysosomes, excluding the canonical xenophagy. Upon Mtb phagosome damage, the Ca 2+ leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation occurred on multiple membranes instead of single or double membranes excluding the noncanonical autophagy pathways. Mechanistically, Ca 2+ leakage from the phagosome triggered the recruitment of the V-ATPase–ATG16L1 complex independently of FIP200, ATG13, and proton gradient disruption. Furthermore, the Ca 2+ leakage–dependent ATG8/LC3 lipidation limited Mtb phagosome damage and restricted Mtb replication. Together, we uncovered Ca 2+ leakage as the key signal that triggers ATG8/LC3 lipidation on multiple membranes to mitigate Mtb phagosome damage.},

Halofuginone suppressed food intake, increased energy expenditure, and resulted in weight loss in diet-induced obese mice while also alleviating insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Using molecular and pharmacological tools with transcriptomics, we identified that halofuginone increases fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) levels via activating integrated stress response. Using Gdf15 and Fgf21 knockout mice, we show that both hormones are necessary to elicit anti-obesity changes.

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) excel in this task due to their near-unity detection efficiency, subhertz dark count rates, and picosecond timing jitter. However, a local increase of current density (current crowding) in the bends of meander-shaped SNSPDs limits these performance metrics. By locally irradiating the SNSPD’s straight segments with helium ions while leaving the bends unirradiated, we realize current crowding–free SNSPDs with simultaneously enhanced sensitivity: After irradiation with 800 ions nm −2 , locally irradiated SNSPDs showed a relative saturation plateau width of 37%, while fully irradiated SNSPDs reached only 10%. This larger relative plateau width allows operation at lower relative bias currents, thereby reducing the dark count rate while still detecting single photons efficiently. We achieve an internal detection efficiency of 94% with 7 mHz dark count rate near the onset of saturating detection efficiency for a wavelength of 780 nm.},

The bubble contained at the end of a micropipette and the surrounding liquid form a gas-liquid multiphase system susceptible to acoustic waves. Driven by a piezoelectric transducer, the oscillating gas-liquid interface induces acoustic microstreaming, markedly increasing the mass transfer efficiency. It enables multiple liquid micromanipulations, including mixing, dispersion, enhancing cell membrane permeability, and harvesting selected cells. Furthermore, a controllable three-dimensional axisymmetric vortex in an open environment overcomes the constraints of microfluidic chip, enabling stable trapping, rapid transportation, and multidirectional rotation of HeLa cells, embryos, and other bio-objects ranging from micrometers to millimeters. A variety of applications demonstrate that the μSonic-hand, with its wide-range capabilities, inherent biocompatibility, and extremely low cost could remarkably advance biomedical science.},

Using automated microinjection into apical progenitors (APs) of embryonic mouse neocortex and electroporation of APs in chimpanzee cerebral organoids, we show that NBPF14 promotes the delamination of AP progeny, by promoting oblique cleavage plane orientation during AP division, leading to increased abundance of the key basal progenitor type, basal radial glia. In contrast, NOTCH2NLB promotes AP proliferation, leading to expansion of the AP pool. When expressed together, NBPF14 and NOTCH2NLB exert coordinated effects, resulting in expansion of basal progenitors while maintaining self-renewal of APs. Hence, these two human-specific genes orchestrate the behavior of APs, and the lineages of their progeny, in a manner essential for the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex.},

One aspect of this debate is how Hadean zircons fit into an ultramafic environment. On the basis of experiments, thermodynamic modeling, and elemental partitioning, we show that felsic melts could have been generated by shallow interaction between primordial serpentinized peridotite and basaltic magmas on Earth and Mars. On the basis of the hafnium isotopic evolution of Hadean detrital zircons worldwide, we infer that these interactions allowed for the formation of extensive Hadean felsic crust (4.4 to 4.5 billion years ago), which, in turn, would account for up to 50% of the present continental crustal mass. A similar process may have occurred on Mars. The serpentinized protocrust had a dual role in the primitive planetary environment: to provide ingredients for the continental crust and to enable life to emerge on water-bearing terrestrial planets.},

The lamina underwent cycles of wrinkling and smoothing as the nucleus changed from an irregular, rounded shape in the wide channel regions between constrictions to a smooth, hourglass shape as the nucleus passed through the center of a constriction. The laminar surface area of nuclei within constrictions was measured to be at or above the computationally predicted threshold area for the nuclear volume. The channels excluded control nuclei that had insufficient excess surface area, but not nuclei lacking lamin A/C.

Our analysis shows that NAT10-dependent ac 4 C-acetylation is robust in rRNA and specific tRNAs but low/spurious in mRNA. It also revealed an inflammatory signature and mutagenesis at transcriptionally active sites in NAT10-KO cells. This finding led us to explore the role of NAT10 in R-loops, which were recently linked to APOBEC3B-mediated mutagenesis. Our analysis showed that R-loops are ac 4 C-acetylated in a NAT10-dependent manner. Furthermore, NAT10 restrains the levels of R-loops at a subset of differentially expressed genes in a catalytic activity–dependent manner. Together with cellular biology data showing ac 4 C-modified RNA in endosomal structures, we propose that increased levels of ac 4 C-unmodified RNAs, likely derived from R-loops, in endosomal structures induce inflammatory responses.},

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence has shown that epigenetic regulation plays a fundamental role in cancer metastasis, the major cause of cancer-related deaths. Here, we conducted an in vivo screen for vulnerabilities of brain metastasis and identified N -acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) as a driver of brain metastasis. Knockdown of NAT10 restrains cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. The poorly characterized RNA helicase domain of NAT10 is critical for cell growth in vitro, while both RNA helicase and NAT domains are essential for primary tumor growth and brain metastasis in vivo. Mechanically, NAT10 promotes the expression of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), two enzymes for serine biosynthesis implicated in brain metastasis. Silencing PHGDH or PSAT1 in metastatic breast cancer cells inhibits their growth in the serine/glycine-limited condition, phenocopying the effects of NAT10 depletion. These findings establish NAT10 as a key regulator of brain metastasis and nominate NAT10 as a target for treating metastasis.},

Current diagnostic imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging fail to characterize oxidative stress within atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce difuranfluoreno-dithiophen–based polymers designed for afterglow imaging, offering ultrabright luminescence, ultralow-power excitation (0.087 milliwatts per square centimeter), and ultrashort acquisition times (0.01 seconds). Through a molecular engineering strategy, we have optimized polymers for enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability, ROS capturing capability, and fluorescence quantum yield, resulting in an increase in afterglow intensity (~130-fold) compared to commonly used 2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene polymer (MEHPPV). Additionally, we have developed ratiometric afterglow nanoparticles doped with oxidative stress–responsive molecules, enabling imaging of oxidative stress markers in atherosclerotic plaque. This approach provides a tool for cardiovascular imaging and diagnostics, which is conducive to the auxiliary diagnosis and risk stratification of atherosclerosis.},

Here, we leveraged unbiased single-nucleus transcriptional profiling and targeted in situ detection to identify Reln (encoding the secreted glycoprotein, Reelin) as a marker of cocaine-activated neuronal populations within the rat NAc. A CRISPR interference approach enabling selective Reln knockdown in the adult NAc altered expression of calcium signaling genes, promoted a transcriptional trajectory consistent with loss of cocaine sensitivity, and decreased MSN excitability. Behaviorally, Reln knockdown prevented cocaine locomotor sensitization, abolished cocaine place preference memory, and decreased cocaine self-administration behavior.

HPB are widely present in the global environment, and their distribution follows a latitudinal diversity gradient. Climate and anthropogenic factors are identified as major drivers of the global distribution of HPB. Our predictions indicated that by the end of this century, the richness, abundance, and invasion risk of HPB will increase globally, with this upward trend becoming more pronounced as development sustainability declines.

At templated AP sites, cross-links between the DNA and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine binding, embryonic stem cell–specific (HMCES) regulate replication fork speed, avoiding cytotoxic double-strand breaks. While the role of HMCES at the template DNA strand is well studied, its effects on nascent DNA are not. We provide evidence that HMCES–DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are detrimental to the BER-mediated removal of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine (5hmdC)–derived 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine from replication forks. HRD cells have heightened HMCES-DPCs, which increase further upon 5hmdC exposure, suggesting that HMCES binds both spontaneous and 5hmdC-induced AP sites. HMCES depletion substantially suppresses 5hmdC-mediated replication fork defects, chromosomal aberrations, and cell death in HRD cells. This reveals that HMCES-DPCs are a source of BER-initiated single-stranded DNA gaps, which indicates that endogenous DPCs contribute to genomic instability in HRD tumors.},

Our previous research revealed that M2 macrophages transfected with magnetotactic bacteria–derived Mms6 gene can resist ferroptosis and enhance SCI recovery. To address the limitations of M2 macrophage transplantation, we developed lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating Mms6 mRNA targeting macrophages ( Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs). The targeting efficiency and therapeutic effect of these LNPs in SCI mice were evaluated. Intravenous administration of Mms6 mRNA-PS/LNPs delivered more Mms6 mRNAs to lesion-site macrophages than those in the Mms6 mRNA-LNP group, which resulted in enhancing motor function recovery, reducing lesion area and scar formation, and promoting neuronal survival and nerve fiber repair. These effects were nullified when macrophages were depleted. These findings suggest that macrophage-targeted delivery of Mms6 mRNA is a promising therapeutic strategy for promoting spinal cord repair and motor function recovery in patients with traumatic SCI.},

Previous research has established headcase as a fundamental gene for stress responses and survival of the Drosophila adult progenitor cells (APCs). However, the molecular role of Headcase has remained elusive. Here, we identify Headcase as a component of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. We also show that, Headcase is required for proper RNP granule formation and remodeling upon stress and is crucial for translation control. Likewise, the human Headcase homolog (HECA) is identified as a component of RNP granules and has similar roles in translational regulation and stress protection. Thus, Headcase proteins define a new family contributing to specific roles among the RNP heterogeneous network.},

The pathogenesis of F. oxysporum in plants is controlled by its circadian clock, with infections causing severe disease symptoms at dawn. Notably, disruption of clock genes dramatically reduces fungal pathogenicity. Circadian clocks regulate the rhythmic expression of several transcription factors, including FoZafA, which enables the pathogen to adapt to zinc starvation within the plant, and FoCzf1, which governs the production of the toxin fusaric acid. Together, our findings highlight the critical roles of circadian clocks in F. oxysporum pathogenicity by regulating zinc starvation response and secondary metabolite production.},

Here, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize neuromodulatory signals in the premotor cortex (medial M2) as mice engage in a competitive matching pennies game. Spatially, NE signals are more segregated with choice and outcome encoded at distinct locations, whereas ACh signals can multiplex and reflect different behavioral correlates at the same site.

Here, we generate a mutant mouse line with human W88C mutation (W88C Mut mice), which exhibits behavioral deficits similar to those observed in patients with TS, including repetitive motor behaviors and sensorimotor gating abnormalities. The W88C mutation leads to the degradation of kidney and brain (KIBRA) protein via a proteasomal pathway, evokes dopamine release in the dorsal striatum, and disrupts synaptic function through the dysregulation of Hippo pathway. Neuron-specific overexpression of wild-type WWC1 rescues synaptic and behavioral phenotypes in W88C Mut mice.

  abstract     = {Fossil assemblages exhibit a global depletion in taxonomic distinctiveness in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction (~252 million years ago), but little is known about why. Here, we examine whether biotic homogenization can be explained by tropical survivors tracking an expansion of their preferred habitat, measured in terms of the ratio of environmental oxygen supply to metabolic demand. We compare spatial similarity in community composition among marine invertebrate fossils represented by bivalve and gastropod fossils with predictions from an ecophysiological model of habitat that diagnoses areas in the ocean that can sustain the aerobic requirements of marine invertebrates. Modeled biogeographic responses to climate change yield an increase in global similarity of community composition among surviving ecophysiotypes, consistent with patterns in the fossil record and arguing for a physiological control on earliest Triassic biogeography.},

To enable x-ray–excited photodynamic therapy (XPDT) that targets deep-seated tumors, we synthesized a nanoscintillator-photosensitizer complex containing 5% Eu-doped Y 2 O 3 fluorescing at 611 nanometers and decorated with SiO 2 containing the scintillation-coupled photosensitizer methylene blue and a polyethylene glycol coating [PEGylated Y 2 O 3 :Eu@SiO 2 -methylene blue (pYSM)]. When irradiated, pYSMs generate singlet oxygen species in vitro, causing cytotoxicity with hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (calreticulin translocation to the cell membrane). Intravenously administered pYSMs home passively to pancreatic tumor xenografts and, upon 10 gray irradiation, cause significant tumor regression ( P &lt; 0.01). On combining XPDT with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, a distant nonirradiated tumor also regresses via an increase in intratumoral activated CD8 + cytotoxic T cells. Collectively, we advance a systemically delivered XPDT strategy that mediates an antitumor effect in both irradiated and nonirradiated (abscopal) tumors when coupled with immunotherapy, converting an immunologically “cold” tumor to an immunologically “hot” tumor.},

Some exploit background motion to hide while hunting, and others may use coloration and behavior to generate motion noise that impairs detection or recognition. Here, we uncover a unique form of motion camouflage, showing that broadclub cuttlefish pass dark stripes downward across their head and arms to disguise their hunting maneuvers. This “passing-stripe” display reduces the probability of response to predatory expanding stimuli by prey crabs in a lab-based experiment, is modulated according to approach speed during a hunt, and generates a motion pattern that is different from that of looming predators. This form of motion camouflage likely functions by overwhelming the threatening motion of the approaching predator with nonthreatening downward motion generated by the rhythmic stripes.},

The gold standard, 2-[ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging, is limited by radioactive exposure and sparse assessment of metabolism beyond glucose uptake and retention. Deuterium magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) with [6,6- 2 H 2 ]glucose is nonradioactive, achieves tumor metabolic contrast, but can be improved by enriched contrast from deuterated water (HDO) based imaging. Here, we developed a DMRI protocol employing [ 2 H 7 ]glucose. Imaging 2 H-signal and measuring HDO production in tumor-bearing mice detected differential glucose utilization across baseline tumors, tumors treated with vehicle control or anti-glycolytic BRAFi and MEKi therapy, and contralateral healthy tissue. Control tumors generated the most 2 H-signal and HDO. To our knowledge this is the first application of DMRI with [ 2 H 7 ]glucose for tumoral treatment monitoring. This approach demonstrates HDO as a marker of tumor glucose utilization and suggests translational capability in humans due to its safety, noninvasiveness, and suitability for serial monitoring.},

Here, we report a unified PUF and TRNG chip based on a 28-nanometer embedded memristor with concealable ability. We use the memristor intrinsic FORMING condition variation and read current variation as entropy sources and design a compact on-chip entropy extractor that achieves a high throughput of 41.7 megabits per second with minimal area overhead of 0.291 MF 2 . To prevent PUF data leakage, we developed a concealment method, protecting data when idle and enabling recovery upon demand. Comprehensive testing shows the chip has excellent performance in randomness, reliability, lifetime, and stability, achieving a 3.82-fold throughput improvement over complementary metal-oxide semiconductor–based designs in authentication tasks.},

We explore peptide nucleic acid (PNA) as a candidate for a genetic-like polymer in a hypothetical sulfuric acid biochemistry. PNA hexamers undergo between 0.4 and 28.6% degradation in 98% (w/w) sulfuric acid at ~25°C, over the span of 14 days, depending on the sequence, but undergo complete solvolysis above 80°C.

A subset of these cancers, which we term as “RBness,” lack RB1 genomic defects and yet phenocopy the transcriptional profile of RB1 -defective cancers. We report RBness as a pan-cancer phenomenon, associated with patient outcome and chemotherapy response in multiple cancer types, and predictive of CDK4/6 inhibitor response in estrogen-positive breast cancer. Using RNA interference and a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in isogenic models, we find that RBness cancers also phenocopy synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cells with RB1 genomic defects. In summary, our findings suggest that dysregulation of the RB pathway in cancers lacking RB1 genomic defects provides a molecular rationale for how these cancers could be treated.},

In this study, we investigate the algorithmic fairness of state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models in chest x-ray diagnosis across five globally sourced datasets. Our findings reveal that compared to board-certified radiologists, these foundation models consistently underdiagnose marginalized groups, with even higher rates seen in intersectional subgroups such as Black female patients. Such biases present over a wide range of pathologies and demographic attributes. Further analysis of the model embedding uncovers its substantial encoding of demographic information. Deploying medical AI systems with biases can intensify preexisting care disparities, posing potential challenges to equitable healthcare access and raising ethical questions about their clinical applications.},

Model simulations show that the combined impact of mobile bottom-contact fishing (e.g., trawling) and dredging reduces natural alkalinity generation by 60 to 220 gigaequivalent year −1 , which is equivalent to a reduction of the natural marine carbon sink by 2 to 8 teragrams CO 2 year −1 . Alkalinity destruction by anthropogenic seafloor disturbance hence generates a hidden CO 2 emission, of which the impact is comparable to the estimated reduction of organic carbon burial by mobile bottom-contact fishing. Our analysis emphasizes that carbon accounting in marine systems should consider the anthropogenic impact on both the organic and inorganic carbon cycles.},

AS3MT d2d3 -Tg mice exhibited enlarged ventricles and deficits in sensorimotor gating and sociability. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses of AS3MT d2d3 -Tg brains revealed cell fate imbalances and altered excitatory neuron composition. AS3MT d2d3 localized to centrosome, disrupting mitotic spindle orientation and differentiation in developing neocortex and organoids, in part through NPM1 (Nucleophosmin 1). The structural analysis identified that hydrophobic residues exposed in AS3MT d2d3 are critical for its pathogenic function.

Here, we show that Ephexin5 activates both RhoA and Cdc42 in the brain. Furthermore, using live imaging of GTPase biosensors, we demonstrate that Ephexin5 regulates activity-dependent Cdc42, but not RhoA, signaling at single synapses. The selectivity of Ephexin5 for Cdc42 activation is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is regulated by neuronal activity. Last, in contrast to Ephexin5’s role in negatively regulating synapse density, we show that, downstream of neuronal activity, Ephexin5 positively regulates synaptic growth and stabilization. Our results support a model in which plasticity-inducing neuronal activity regulates Ephexin5 tyrosine phosphorylation, driving Ephexin5-mediated activation of Cdc42 and the spine structural growth and stabilization vital for learning.},

When salt water overlays permafrost, Rayleigh-Darcy (R-D) instability emerges because of the density mismatch and regulates melting (thawing) dynamics. Contrary to expectations that a higher Rayleigh number ( R ) would amplify instability, our experiments revealed fingering and stable melting fronts at low and high R , respectively. We attribute the occurrence of the two melting patterns to the interplay between two competing flow structures: local circumfluence modulated by front perturbation and transversal chaotic mixing. We propose theories that rationalize the melting pattern transition and finger-scale evolution. In addition, the classic mass transport theory for R-D convection drastically underestimates the melting rate and misses key variable(s). The presence of fingering patterns and accelerated dynamics may have led to earlier penetration of the permafrost layer than previously anticipated. These findings have implications for understanding similar processes in magma migration, carbon sequestration, and subsurface energy recovery.},

On Jupiter, the presence of water has been invoked to control the occurrence of large-scale storms; however, the impact of storms on the ammonia and temperature distribution is unknown. We use Juno Microwave Radiometer observations of a large-scale storm in 2017 to study the aftermath of such a storm on the atmosphere. Anomalies in the retrieved ammonia abundance and atmospheric temperature show how storms deplete and heat the upper atmosphere while simultaneously depositing material well below the layers they were triggered at. These observations, aided by simulations, show that the water and ammonia cycles are coupled and that their combined effect plays a key role in explaining the depletion of ammonia in the tropospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.},

  abstract     = {Relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (rrAML) is a malignant blood cancer with an extremely poor prognosis, largely ascribed to the drug-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Most patients suffer from a risk of difficult-to-cure as well as severe systemic toxicity when receiving standard chemotherapies. As hyaluronic acid (HA) is a specific ligand of CD44 highly expressed by LSCs, we had HA self-assembled with cisplatin and daunorubicin to form a dual chemodrug nanogel (HA/Cis/Dau) to afford the targeted therapeutic interventions of rrAML. HA/Cis/Dau displayed an extra therapeutic function of inducing the granulocyte-monocyte differentiation in CD44 + rrAML cells, an rrAML mouse model, and primary blasts isolated from patients with AML. Unlike free drugs directly diffusing and killing rrAML cells, HA/Cis/Dau transported the drugs into lysosomes, causing lysosomal membrane permeabilization, ROS accumulation, and thus a metabolic reprogramming of the rrAML cells. Moreover, HA/Cis/Dau was featured with alleviated side effects, ease of preparation, and cost effectiveness, therefore holding great promises for the targeted treatment of rrAML.},

In contrast, we demonstrate here the use of thermalization in the generation, control, and readout of “shell-like” spin textures with interacting 13 C nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The textures span several nanometers and encompass many hundred spins; they are created and interrogated without manipulating the nuclear spins individually. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-engineered Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field: The texture is therefore metastable and robust against spin diffusion.

  abstract     = {Extremely palatable food is pleasant and can cause prolonged consumption, which sometimes leads to overeating and obesity. The neural circuits underlying this eating behavior are poorly understood. Zhu et al . found that neurons projecting from a brain region surrounding the locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) mediated the increase of palatable food consumption (see the Perspective by Small). Temporally precise closed-loop VTA dopamine-releasing neuron modulation exclusively during consumption was critical for controlling this behavior. Activation of satiety pathways with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist suppressed VTA dopamine-releasing neuron responses during palatable food consumption. These findings reveal that VTA dopamine-releasing neurons encode palatability and control the consummatory phase of eating dependent on the specific timing of their activity. —Peter Stern Hedonic eating is defined as food consumption driven by palatability without physiological need. However, neural control of palatable food intake is poorly understood. We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by a neural pathway from the peri–locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTA DA ) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTA DA neuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTA DA neuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTA DA neuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTA DA neurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide.},

Owner behaviors such as limiting food access and providing physical activity can help mitigate the dogs’ risks, but genetic variants are also thought to play a role. Wallis et al . performed a genome-wide association study in hundreds of pet Labrador retrievers and identified the gene DENND1B as a major culprit in these dogs’ obesity. The authors demonstrated that DENND1B regulates the activity of the melanocortin 4 receptor, which plays a major role in energy homeostasis. They also identified a human patient with a mutation in DENND1B and other humans with additional mutations found in the dogs, demonstrating the connection to human physiology. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Obesity is a heritable disease, but its genetic basis is incompletely understood. Canine population history facilitates trait mapping. We performed a canine genome-wide association study for body condition score—a measure of obesity—in 241 Labrador retrievers. Using a cross-species approach, we showed that canine obesity genes are also associated with rare and common forms of obesity in humans. The lead canine association was within the gene DENN domain containing 1B ( DENND1B ). Each copy of the alternate allele was associated with ~7% greater body fat. We demonstrate a role for this gene in regulating signaling and trafficking of melanocortin 4 receptor, a critical controller of energy homeostasis.

  abstract     = {Beginning as early as 5000 years ago and lasting until just around 150 years ago, horses were integral to human societies. Their capacity for intense exertion led to their being used as everything from beasts of burden to elite racers. This athleticism is largely driven by increased oxygen consumption rates due to muscles full of mitochondria. Castiglione et al . found that horses evolved to cope with the increased oxidative burden brought about by mitochondrial activity through the evolution of a single point mutation that increases oxidative phosphorylation while simultaneously mitigating the consequent oxidative stress. —Sacha Vignieri Horses are among nature’s greatest athletes, yet the ancestral molecular adaptations fueling their energy demands are poorly understood. Within a clinically important pathway regulating redox and metabolic homeostasis (NRF2/KEAP1), we discovered an ancient mutation—conserved in all extant equids—that increases mitochondrial respiration while decreasing tissue-damaging oxidative stress. This mutation is a de novo premature opal stop codon in KEAP1 that is translationally recoded into a cysteine through previously unknown mechanisms, producing an R15C mutation in KEAP1 that is more sensitive to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. This recoding enables increased NRF2 activity, which enhances mitochondrial adenosine 5′-triphosphate production and cellular resistance to oxidative damage. Our study illustrates how recoding of a de novo stop codon, a strategy thought restricted to viruses, can facilitate adaptation in vertebrates.},

Breakdown of the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains of integral membrane proteins is especially challenging, and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Combining organelle proteomics, untargeted metabolomics, and reconstitution assays, Jain et al . identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP) as the protease responsible for degrading hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which has a high level of endocytosis. LyLAP ablation caused undigested hydrophobic domains to accumulate and led to lysosomal damage and PDA cell death, highlighting the critical role of this process under conditions of high membrane protein turnover. —Stella M. Hurtley Breakdown of every transmembrane protein trafficked to lysosomes requires proteolysis of their hydrophobic helical transmembrane domains. Combining lysosomal proteomics with functional genomic datasets, we identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP; formerly phospholipase B domain–containing 1) as the hydrolase most tightly associated with elevated endocytosis. Untargeted metabolomics and biochemical reconstitution demonstrated that LyLAP is a processive monoaminopeptidase with preference for amino-terminal leucine. This activity was necessary and sufficient for the breakdown of hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP was up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which relies on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. In PDA cells, LyLAP ablation led to the buildup of undigested hydrophobic peptides, lysosomal membrane damage, and growth inhibition. Thus, LyLAP enables lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins and protects lysosomal integrity in highly endocytic cancer cells.},

Differences between zygotes and two-cell embryos highlight reprogramming in chromatin accessibility during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.

  abstract     = {Many bacteria maintain their genomic DNA as circular plasmids, but some species keep their chromosomes as linear molecules, similar to eukaryotes. The ends of linear chromosomes have adaptations called telomeres that are protected and maintained by enzymes. Hsieh et al . discovered a class of parasitic DNA elements called transposons that bias integration into chromosome ends. These telomeric transposons use special assembly and targeting mechanisms and have their own telomere maintenance systems that allow the element to control the chromosome end. These bacteria thus need to preserve the transposon, which ensures its survival and shapes how it exchanges genetic information. —Di Jiang Eukaryotes have linear DNA, and their telomeres are hotspots for transposons, which in some cases took over telomere maintenance. We identified several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . Although these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, substantially influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.},

In this excitation scheme, the signal pulses exponentially grow or decrease in amplitude over time. This dynamical behavior allows passive systems to mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to non-Hermitian responses without specific material modifications and leading to exotic optical effects. Applicable to wave systems in general, such complex excitations can be applied to developments in metamaterials, optical computing, sensing, and image processing. —Ian S.

By contrast, non-Hermitian wave systems are characterized by Hamiltonians with poles and zeros at complex frequencies, whose control through precise engineering of material loss and gain can lead to exotic scattering phenomena. Notably, excitation signals that oscillate at complex-valued frequencies can mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to these non-Hermitian responses without material modifications. These findings have been advancing the fundamental understanding of wave-matter interactions and are enabling breakthroughs in metamaterials, imaging, sensing, and computing.

  abstract     = {Plant immunity relies heavily on intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, which can act as either receptors or signal transducers to facilitate disease resistance. In wheat and barley, an alternative class of genes called the tandem kinases also contribute to disease resistance. Two papers in this issue elucidate how tandem kinases work, showing that wheat tandem kinases require an NLR to function. Chen et al . found a pathogen effector that triggers the action of the wheat Sr62 tandem kinase. They demonstrate that the effector interacts with Sr62’s active kinase domain, enabling a pseudokinase domain to activate the corresponding NLR. In parallel, Lu et al . found that a different tandem kinase, WTK3, activates the same NLR as Sr62, and that this NLR acts as a calcium ion channel once activated. Together, these studies solidify the role of NLRs as hubs for immune signaling in response to diverse pathogens and will guide breeding efforts for disease-resistant wheat. —Madeleine Seale Tandem kinase proteins underlie the innate immune systems of cereal plants, but how they initiate plant immune responses remains unclear. This report identifies wheat protein wheat tandem NBD 1 (WTN1), a noncanonical nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor featuring tandem nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, plant R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domains, required for WTK3-mediated disease resistance. Both WTK3 and its allelic variant Rwt4—known for conferring resistance to wheat powdery mildew and blast, respectively—are capable of recognizing the blast effector PWT4. They activate WTN1 to form calcium-permeable channels, akin to ZAR1 and Sr35. Thus, tandem kinase proteins and their associated NLRs operate as “sensor-executor” pairs against fungal pathogens. Additionally, evolutionary analyses reveal a coevolutionary trajectory of the tandem kinase-NLR module, highlighting their cooperative role in triggering plant immunity.},

  abstract     = {In theory, nanocrystalline alloys should be able to retain considerable strength even at high temperatures, but this has rarely been demonstrated in practice. Hornbuckle et al . started with a binary alloy of copper (Cu) and tantalum (Ta), even though the two are immiscible, to which they added lithium (Li). This mixture resulted in precipitates of nanoscale clusters of Cu 3 Li coated with Ta. This core-shell structure neither dissolves nor coarsens at temperatures of up to 800°C while also causing the yielding strength to be in excess of 1 gigapascal. —Marc S. Lavine We present a bulk nanocrystalline copper alloy that can operate at near-melting temperatures with minimal coarsening and creep deformation. The thermal stability of the Cu-3Ta-0.5Li atomic % (at %) alloy is attributed to coherent, ordered L1 2 Cu 3 Li precipitates surrounded by a tantalum-rich atomic bilayer phase boundary complexion. Adding 0.5 at % lithium to the immiscible Cu-Ta system changes the morphology of the nanoscale precipitates from spherical to cuboidal while simultaneously tailoring the phase boundary. The resultant complexion-stabilized nanoscale precipitates provide excellent thermal stability, strength, and creep resistance. The underlying alloy design principles may guide the development of next-generation copper alloys for high-temperature applications such as heat exchangers.},

  abstract     = {As climate has warmed, precipitation and evapotranspiration changes have affected land surface water fluxes. What impact has that had on terrestrial water storage, the amount of water stored on and in the land? Seo et al . combined soil moisture data from satellites, measurements of sea level, and observations of polar motion to estimate terrestrial water storage over the past four decades, which revealed a dramatic decline (see the Perspective by Samaniego). During the interval from 2000 to 2002, terrestrial water storage decreased by nearly twice as much as Greenland ice mass loss over the same period. —Jesse Smith Rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures have caused substantial changes in terrestrial water circulation and land surface water fluxes, such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, potentially leading to abrupt shifts in terrestrial water storage. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) soil moisture (SM) product reveals a sharp depletion during the early 21st century. During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland’s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002–2006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift (~45 centimeters). Precipitation deficits and stable evapotranspiration likely caused this decline, and SM has not recovered as of 2021, with future recovery unlikely under present climate conditions.},

In this study, we show that the SR62 locus is a digenic module encoding the Sr62 TK TK and an NLR (Sr62 NLR ), and we identify the corresponding AvrSr62 effector. AvrSr62 binds to the N-terminal kinase 1 of Sr62 TK , triggering displacement of kinase 2, which activates Sr62 NLR . Modeling and mutation analysis indicated that this is mediated by overlapping binding sites (i) on kinase 1 for binding AvrSr62 and kinase 2 and (ii) on kinase 2 for binding kinase 1 and Sr62 NLR .

  abstract     = {US police detain racial or ethnic minority drivers (Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic) more than white drivers. However, a longstanding debate remains unsettled: Does this necessarily reflect police bias? Hypothetically, if minorities were more prone to disobey speed limits and traffic laws, then their traffic stops may be warranted. To put this debate to rest, Aggarwal et al . examined rideshare data from Lyft in the state of Florida to compare minority drivers with their white counterparts. Lyft objectively measured drivers’ locations, driving speed, and location speed limits (see the Perspective by Knox and Mummolo). White and minority drivers showed no discernible differences in speeding behaviors or traffic violations. However, when both drove at identical speeds, police were still 33% more likely to issue speeding citations to minority drivers and charged 34% more expensive fines, unequivocally revealing bias. —Ekeoma Uzogara Prior research on racial profiling has found that in encounters with law enforcement, minorities are punished more severely than white civilians. Less is known about the causes of these encounters and their implications for our understanding of racial profiling. Using high-frequency location data of rideshare drivers in Florida ( N = 222,838 individuals), we estimate the effect of driver race on citations and fines for speeding using 19.3 million location pings. Compared with a white driver traveling the same speed, we find that racial or ethnic minority drivers are 24 to 33% more likely to be cited for speeding and pay 23 to 34% more money in fines. We find no evidence that accident and reoffense rates explain these estimates, which suggests that an animus against minorities underlies our results.},

  abstract     = {Demography is critical for understanding how genetic variation has moved through time and space, and thus the selective and stochastic forces involved. However, these patterns are difficult to determine from modern genomes alone because different scenarios can result in similar genomic outcomes. Grundler et al . created a method using ancestral recombination graphs to trace the spatiotemporal history of DNA segments shared between modern humans (see the Perspective by Gravel). They predicted the least costly migration paths for their sampled individuals back through 200,000 years ago, showing that the most likely path out of Africa was the northern route. This method may prove useful in other species and could provide an alternate way to account for shared ancestry in genetic studies. —Corinne N. Simonti Describing the distribution of genetic variation across individuals is a fundamental goal of population genetics. We present a method that capitalizes on the rich genealogical information encoded in genomic tree sequences to infer the geographic locations of the shared ancestors of a sample of sequenced individuals. We used this method to infer the geographic history of genetic ancestry of a set of human genomes sampled from Europe, Asia, and Africa, accurately recovering major population movements on those continents. Our findings demonstrate the importance of defining the spatiotemporal context of genetic ancestry when describing human genetic variation and caution against the oversimplified interpretations of genetic data prevalent in contemporary discussions of race and ancestry.},

An unfulfilled challenge lies in haptic interface technologies that can engage all the various mechanoreceptors in a programmable, spatiotemporal fashion across large areas of the body. Here, we introduce a small-scale actuator technology that can impart omnidirectional, superimposable, dynamic forces to the surface of skin, as the basis for stimulating individual classes of mechanoreceptors or selected combinations of them.

We show their utility as versatile radical precursors, as exemplified with seven C–C bond–forming, redox-neutral cross-couplings with activated olefins, alkyl halides, redox-active esters, aryl halides, alkenyl halides, alkynyl halides, and a trifluoromethylating reagent, to forge C(sp 3 )-C(sp 3 ), C(sp 3 )-C(sp 2 ), and C(sp 3 )-C(sp) bonds.

China now publishes more scientific papers than any other country, and the impact of this research (although trickier to measure) is impressive ( 1 ). Despite China’s remarkable progress, its policymakers continue to grapple with a basic question that all countries face: how to balance between promoting research focused on national priorities and that driven by academic curiosity. This article begins by explaining how Chinese policy-makers have recently stepped up efforts to guide science in keeping with national priorities, including economic, environmental, and national security concerns. It then notes an important countercurrent, particularly the growing interest in “original innovation” and the appreciation that curiosity-driven research has a role to play in this regard. It concludes by noting that China is part of a broader international shift to leverage science for national purposes, and by highlighting the risks this trend entails.},

Similarly, particles in a quantum system are entangled to share some correlated feature even if they are far away. This phenomenon, called quantum entanglement ( 1 ), is important for quantum information processing but highly sensitive to decoherence (loss of quantum properties) ( 2 ). Exposure to uncontrolled environments, such as thermal fluctuations, causes entangled particles to pick up random noises, which leads to a so-called mixed state. Fortunately, there are ways to “filter” a mixed state back into a pure entangled state by engineering a quantum bath (or reservoir)—a controlled environment to which the system is coupled ( 3 , 4 ). On page 1424 of this issue, Selim et al. ( 5 ) report a new way to filter entangled photons by exploiting a fundamental physics concept that is extensively applied in classical context, called non-Hermitian symmetries. This could offer a new way of solving a key challenge in quantum technology.},

However, in many human populations, this adaptive behavior is made maladaptive by readily available, energy-dense sources of food, resulting in high rates of obesity. One such behavior, called invigoration, causes an increase in speed, duration, and intake of a palatable food ( 1 ). The neural mechanisms underlying this behavior are not yet clear. On page 1376 of this issue, Zhu et al . ( 2 ) report a brain circuit that drives feeding invigoration in mice. This circuit begins with neurons in the area around the locus coeruleus (periLC) and results in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The finding provides a neural target, the therapeutic modulation of which might enable changes to food intake by preventing invigoration.},

How climate warming affects Earth’s hydrological cycle—the continuous water movement between Earth and the atmosphere—is a key question for managing water resources and making weather predictions. Although local and regional changes in the water cycle have been observed ( 1 , 2 ), conclusive proof of a global-scale shift has been elusive. Answering this question requires decades of global mean sea level data and advanced climate and hydrological modeling. On page 1408 of this issue, Seo et al .

  abstract     = {Torque and continuous rotation are fundamental methods of actuation and manipulation in rigid robots. Soft robot arms use soft materials and structures to mimic the passive compliance of biological arms that bend and extend. This use of compliance prevents soft arms from continuously transmitting and exerting torques to interact with their environment. Here, we show how relying on patterning structures instead of inherent material properties allows soft robotic arms to remain compliant while continuously transmitting torque to their environment. We demonstrate a soft robotic arm made from a pair of mechanical metamaterials that act as compliant constant-velocity joints. The joints are up to 52 times stiffer in torsion than bending and can bend up to 45°. This robot arm continuously transmits torque while remaining flexible in all other directions. The arm’s mechanical design achieves high motion repeatability (0.4 millimeters and 0.1°) when tracking trajectories. We then trained a neural network to learn the inverse kinematics, enabling us to program the arm to complete tasks that are challenging for existing soft robots, such as installing light bulbs, fastening bolts, and turning valves. The arm’s passive compliance makes it safe around humans and provides a source of mechanical intelligence, enabling it to adapt to misalignment when manipulating objects. This work will bridge the gap between hard and soft robotics with applications in human assistance, warehouse automation, and extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic fields enable remote manipulation of objects and are ideal for medical applications because they pass through human tissue harmlessly. This capability is promising for surgical robots, allowing navigation deeper into the human anatomy and accessing organs beyond the reach of current technologies. However, magnetic manipulation is typically limited to a maximum two–degrees-of-freedom orientation, restricting complex motions, especially those including rolling around the main axis of the magnetic robot. To address this challenge, we introduce a robot design inspired by embodied intelligence and the unique geometry of developable rollers, leveraging the oloid shape. The oloid, with its axial asymmetry and sinusoidal motion, facilitates rolling when precisely controlled by an external magnetic field. We present a versatile closed-loop control model to ensure precise magnetic manipulation of an oloid-shaped robot. This capability was validated in endoluminal applications through the integration of a 28-megahertz micro-ultrasound array to perform virtual biopsies, noninvasive real-time histological imaging. Extensive in vitro and in vivo tests using a porcine model showed the robot’s ability to execute sweeping motions, identify lesions, and generate detailed three-dimensional scans of gastrointestinal subsurface tissue. This research not only restores a critical movement capability to magnetic medical robots but also enables additional clinical applications deep within the human body.},

  abstract     = {Locomotors traversing arboreal environments must often leap across large gaps to land on small-diameter supports. Balancing these dynamic landings is challenging because of high incident momentum, restricted foothold options, and reduced capacity to produce reaction torques on narrow supports. We hypothesized that leg length control to enhance branch reaction control authority would markedly expand the range of successful landing conditions, drawing on the same powerful leg actuation required for leaping. Exploring this balance strategy, the monopedal robot Salto-1P demonstrates branch-to-branch leaps, including some upright balanced landings, despite negligible grasping torque. We also compared this landing strategy with the landings of squirrels, which similarly lack the grip strength found in other arboreal species. We demonstrate that greater radial force control reduces the inertial body torque and/or grasping torque at the support required to balance a given landing. Adding simple radial force balance control strategies to conventional balance controllers greatly expands potential landing conditions, increasing the range of initial angular momentum that can be balanced by 230 and 470% across ranges of landing angles for low-order models of the robot and squirrel, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Research on miniature deep-sea robots is an emerging field focused on the development of deployable, compact devices capable of interacting with the unique environments and organisms of the deep ocean. In this study, we present a design strategy for a centimeter-scale deep-sea soft actuator, weighing 16 grams, that incorporates bistable chiral metamaterials and tube-sealed shape memory alloys. According to our design, the increased modulus induced by the hydrostatic pressure was used to achieve a higher snapping velocity of the bistable chiral unit, thus lifting the actuator’s performance. We showed that the actuator can produce undistorted cyclic motions at various depths in the deep sea. Subsequently, we developed an untethered miniature deep-sea robot that is capable of multimodal locomotion by repurposing its legs and fins. To validate the robot’s performance, this miniature robot was deployed from deep-sea crewed submersibles, performing swimming, gliding, morphing, and crawling in the Haima Cold Seep (1380-meter depth) and the Mariana Trench (10,600-meter depth); it was then retrieved by the submersible fully intact. The actuation module design enabled the robot to perform comparably in the Haima Cold Seep and laboratory aquarium conditions (atmospheric pressure). Additionally, we developed a wearable soft gripper based on the same metamaterial design strategy to facilitate safe deep-sea operations, ranging from soft-specimen collection to heavy-object manipulation (~3400-meter depth). This study offers design insights into creating next-generation miniature deep-sea actuators and robots, paving the way for future exploration and interaction with deep-sea ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Rehabilitation robotics aims to promote activity-dependent reorganization of the nervous system. However, people with paralysis cannot generate sufficient activity during robot-assisted rehabilitation and, consequently, do not benefit from these therapies. Here, we developed an implantable spinal cord neuroprosthesis operating in a closed loop to promote robust activity during walking and cycling assisted by robotic devices. This neuroprosthesis is device agnostic and designed for seamless implementation by nonexpert users. Preliminary evaluations in participants with paralysis showed that the neuroprosthesis enabled well-organized patterns of muscle activity during robot-assisted walking and cycling. A proof-of-concept study suggested that robot-assisted rehabilitation augmented by the neuroprosthesis promoted sustained neurological improvements. Moreover, the neuroprosthesis augmented recreational walking and cycling activities outdoors. Future clinical trials will have to confirm these findings in a broader population.},

  abstract     = {Operating in the brain for deep-seated tumors or surgical targets for epilepsy is technically demanding and normally requires a large craniotomy with its attendant risk and morbidity. Neuroendoscopic surgery has the potential to reduce risk and morbidity by permitting surgical access through a small incision with burr hole and a narrow corridor through the brain. However, current endoscopic neurosurgical tools are straight and rigid and lack dexterity, hindering their adoption for neuroendoscopic procedures. We propose a class of robotic neurosurgical tools that have magnetically actuated wristed end effectors small enough to fit through a neuroendoscope working channel. The tools were less than 3.2 millimeters in overall diameter and contained embedded permanent magnets that allowed wireless actuation with magnetic fields. Three magnetic tools are presented: a two–degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) wristed gripper, a one-DoF pivoting scalpel, and a one-DoF twisted string–actuated forceps. This work evaluated the feasibility of these tools for completing minimally invasive neurosurgical resection and cutting tasks. Experimental tests on a silicone brain phantom showed that the tools could reach the ventricle area for simulated tumor removal and access a section of the corpus callosotomy for a simulated tissue-severing procedure in epilepsy treatment. Integration of the magnetic end effectors with a concentric tube robot as a hybrid steerable surgical robotic system enabled in vivo experiments on piglets. These experiments show that wireless magnetic tools could perform essential neurosurgical tasks, including gripping, cutting, and biopsy on living brain tissue, suggesting their potential for clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {The integration of social robots into family environments raises critical questions about their long-term influence on family interactions. This study explores the potential of social robots as conversational catalysts in human-human dyadic interaction, focusing on enhancing high-quality, reciprocal conversations between parents and children during dialogic coreading activities. With the increasing prevalence of social robots in homes and the recognized importance of parent-child exchanges for children’s developmental milestones, this work presents a comprehensive empirical investigation involving more than 70 parent-child dyads over a period of 1 to 2 months. We examined the effects of three robot interaction styles—a passive robot listener, an active robot with a fixed behavior strategy, and an active robot with a strategy-switching mechanism—on parent-child conversational dynamics. Our findings reveal that a robot’s active participation enhances the quality of parent-child dialogic conversations. The influence of robot facilitation varied on the basis of parental English proficiency. Strategy-switching robots provided greater benefits to non–native English–speaking families, whereas dyads with native English–speaking parents benefited more from fixed-strategy robots. Overall, this study highlights the promise of social robots that empower parents in fostering their children’s dialogic development—a contrast with the prevalent design of educational robots that primarily target children. It provides critical insights into the equitable, nuanced design of long-term family-robot interactions at home, especially in supporting diverse family backgrounds.},

  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) control many physiological processes and are important pharmacological targets. Luebbers et al. developed an optical biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that directly measures the endogenous activation of Gα i subunits in response to GPCR stimulation in both cell lines and mouse astrocytes. In a neuronal cell line, experiments with Gα i bONE-GO revealed that several neuropeptides classified as full agonists of opioid receptors instead behaved as partial agonists. Unlike biosensors typically used to measure GPCR activation, Gα i bONE-GO does not depend on exogenously expressed receptors or G proteins and can be deployed in many cell types using a single expression construct. —Annalisa M. VanHook The activation of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) by G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a mechanism broadly used by eukaryotes to transduce signals across the plasma membrane and a target for many clinical drugs. Many optical biosensors commonly used for measuring GPCR-stimulated G protein activity rely on exogenously expressed GPCRs and/or G proteins, which compromise readout fidelity. Biosensors that measure endogenous signaling may interfere with the signaling process under investigation or have a limited dynamic range of detection, hindering applicability. Here, we developed an optical BRET-based biosensor, Gα i bONE-GO, that detects endogenous GTP-bound (active) Gα i upon stimulation of endogenous GPCRs more robustly than existing sensors of endogenous activity. Its design leverages the Gα i -binding protein GINIP as a high-affinity and specific detector of Gα i -GTP. We optimized this design to prevent interference with downstream G i -dependent signaling and to enable implementation in different experimental systems having endogenous GPCRs, including adenosine receptors in primary astroglial cells and opioid receptors in cell lines. In a neuronal cell line, Gα i bONE-GO revealed activation profiles indicating that several natural opioid neuropeptides acted as partial agonists, in contrast with their characterization as full agonists using biosensors that depend on exogenously expressed receptors and G proteins. The Gα i bONE-GO biosensor is a direct and sensitive detector of endogenous activation of Gα i proteins by GPCRs in different experimental settings but does not interfere with the subsequent propagation of signaling.},

  abstract     = {Many cancers suppress immune surveillance and resist immune-targeted therapies. Chen et al. found that antitumor immunity and treatment might be improved by harnessing an antibody associated with the autoimmune disease lupus. The antibody, called 4H2, was taken up into cells where it bound to endogenous (“self”) RNA to recruit and activate the nucleic acid sensor cGAS, which initiated inflammatory signaling that was cytotoxic to brain, lung, and breast cancer cells in culture but not to normal breast epithelial cells. In mice with glioblastomas, 4H2 localized to the tumor microenvironment after systemic administration, improved animal survival in a T cell–dependent manner, and improved the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, demonstrating its potential for treating patients. —Leslie K. Ferrarelli Nucleic acid–mediated signaling triggers an immune response that is believed to be central to the pathophysiology of autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we found that a cell-penetrating, SLE-associated antiguanosine autoantibody may present therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment. The autoantibody entered cells through a nucleoside salvage-linked pathway of membrane transit that avoids endosomes and lysosomes and bound to endogenous RNA in live cells. In orthotopic models of glioblastoma, the antibody localized to areas adjacent to necrotic tumor cells and promoted animal survival in a manner that depended on T cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that antibody binding to nucleic acids activated the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), thereby stimulating immune signaling and cGAS-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, the autoantibody could carry and deliver functional RNA into tumor, brain, and muscle tissues in live mice when administered locally. The findings establish a collaborative autoantibody–nucleic acid interaction that is translatable to strategies for nonviral gene delivery and immunotherapy.},
