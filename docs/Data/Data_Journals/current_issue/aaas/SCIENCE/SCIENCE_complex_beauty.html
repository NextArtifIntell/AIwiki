  abstract     = {Extremely palatable food is pleasant and can cause prolonged consumption, which sometimes leads to overeating and obesity. The neural circuits underlying this eating behavior are poorly understood. Zhu et al . found that neurons projecting from a brain region surrounding the locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) mediated the increase of palatable food consumption (see the Perspective by Small). Temporally precise closed-loop VTA dopamine-releasing neuron modulation exclusively during consumption was critical for controlling this behavior. Activation of satiety pathways with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist suppressed VTA dopamine-releasing neuron responses during palatable food consumption. These findings reveal that VTA dopamine-releasing neurons encode palatability and control the consummatory phase of eating dependent on the specific timing of their activity. —Peter Stern Hedonic eating is defined as food consumption driven by palatability without physiological need. However, neural control of palatable food intake is poorly understood. We discovered that hedonic eating is controlled by a neural pathway from the peri–locus ceruleus to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using photometry-calibrated optogenetics, we found that VTA dopamine (VTA DA ) neurons encode palatability to bidirectionally regulate hedonic food consumption. VTA DA neuron responsiveness was suppressed during food consumption by semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1R) agonist used as an antiobesity drug. Mice recovered palatable food appetite and VTA DA neuron activity during repeated semaglutide treatment, which was reversed by consumption-triggered VTA DA neuron inhibition. Thus, hedonic food intake activates VTA DA neurons, which sustain further consumption, a mechanism that opposes appetite reduction by semaglutide.},

  abstract     = {Obesity is frequently seen not only in humans, but also in dogs, and some breeds are particularly at risk. Owner behaviors such as limiting food access and providing physical activity can help mitigate the dogs’ risks, but genetic variants are also thought to play a role. Wallis et al . performed a genome-wide association study in hundreds of pet Labrador retrievers and identified the gene DENND1B as a major culprit in these dogs’ obesity. The authors demonstrated that DENND1B regulates the activity of the melanocortin 4 receptor, which plays a major role in energy homeostasis. They also identified a human patient with a mutation in DENND1B and other humans with additional mutations found in the dogs, demonstrating the connection to human physiology. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich Obesity is a heritable disease, but its genetic basis is incompletely understood. Canine population history facilitates trait mapping. We performed a canine genome-wide association study for body condition score—a measure of obesity—in 241 Labrador retrievers. Using a cross-species approach, we showed that canine obesity genes are also associated with rare and common forms of obesity in humans. The lead canine association was within the gene DENN domain containing 1B ( DENND1B ). Each copy of the alternate allele was associated with ~7% greater body fat. We demonstrate a role for this gene in regulating signaling and trafficking of melanocortin 4 receptor, a critical controller of energy homeostasis. Thus, canine genetics identified obesity genes and mechanisms relevant to both dogs and humans.},

  abstract     = {Beginning as early as 5000 years ago and lasting until just around 150 years ago, horses were integral to human societies. Their capacity for intense exertion led to their being used as everything from beasts of burden to elite racers. This athleticism is largely driven by increased oxygen consumption rates due to muscles full of mitochondria. Castiglione et al . found that horses evolved to cope with the increased oxidative burden brought about by mitochondrial activity through the evolution of a single point mutation that increases oxidative phosphorylation while simultaneously mitigating the consequent oxidative stress. —Sacha Vignieri Horses are among nature’s greatest athletes, yet the ancestral molecular adaptations fueling their energy demands are poorly understood. Within a clinically important pathway regulating redox and metabolic homeostasis (NRF2/KEAP1), we discovered an ancient mutation—conserved in all extant equids—that increases mitochondrial respiration while decreasing tissue-damaging oxidative stress. This mutation is a de novo premature opal stop codon in KEAP1 that is translationally recoded into a cysteine through previously unknown mechanisms, producing an R15C mutation in KEAP1 that is more sensitive to electrophiles and reactive oxygen species. This recoding enables increased NRF2 activity, which enhances mitochondrial adenosine 5′-triphosphate production and cellular resistance to oxidative damage. Our study illustrates how recoding of a de novo stop codon, a strategy thought restricted to viruses, can facilitate adaptation in vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {Integral membrane proteins are essential for cell signaling, adhesion, migration, and nutrient uptake, and are ultimately degraded in catabolic organelles known as lysosomes. Breakdown of the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains of integral membrane proteins is especially challenging, and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Combining organelle proteomics, untargeted metabolomics, and reconstitution assays, Jain et al . identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP) as the protease responsible for degrading hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which has a high level of endocytosis. LyLAP ablation caused undigested hydrophobic domains to accumulate and led to lysosomal damage and PDA cell death, highlighting the critical role of this process under conditions of high membrane protein turnover. —Stella M. Hurtley Breakdown of every transmembrane protein trafficked to lysosomes requires proteolysis of their hydrophobic helical transmembrane domains. Combining lysosomal proteomics with functional genomic datasets, we identified lysosomal leucine aminopeptidase (LyLAP; formerly phospholipase B domain–containing 1) as the hydrolase most tightly associated with elevated endocytosis. Untargeted metabolomics and biochemical reconstitution demonstrated that LyLAP is a processive monoaminopeptidase with preference for amino-terminal leucine. This activity was necessary and sufficient for the breakdown of hydrophobic transmembrane domains. LyLAP was up-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which relies on macropinocytosis for nutrient uptake. In PDA cells, LyLAP ablation led to the buildup of undigested hydrophobic peptides, lysosomal membrane damage, and growth inhibition. Thus, LyLAP enables lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins and protects lysosomal integrity in highly endocytic cancer cells.},

To gain insight into this process, Li et al . developed sequencing methods for assessing chromatin accessibility in individual cells. They then applied these methods to mouse embryos at 10 distinct stages, ranging from the zygote to the late blastocyst, mapping key changes in chromatin state in different cell lineages over the course of these key stages in early development. —Yevgeniya Nusinovich In mammals, fertilized eggs undergo genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming to generate the organism. However, our understanding of epigenetic dynamics during preimplantation development at single-cell resolution remains incomplete. Here, we developed scNanoATAC-seq2, a single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using long-read sequencing for scarce samples. We present a detailed chromatin accessibility landscape of mouse preimplantation development, revealing distinct chromatin signatures in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm during lineage segregation. Differences between zygotes and two-cell embryos highlight reprogramming in chromatin accessibility during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Single-cell long-read sequencing enables in-depth analysis of chromatin accessibility in noncanonical imprinting, imprinted X chromosome inactivation, and low-mappability genomic regions, such as repetitive elements and paralogs.

  abstract     = {Many bacteria maintain their genomic DNA as circular plasmids, but some species keep their chromosomes as linear molecules, similar to eukaryotes. The ends of linear chromosomes have adaptations called telomeres that are protected and maintained by enzymes. Hsieh et al . discovered a class of parasitic DNA elements called transposons that bias integration into chromosome ends. These telomeric transposons use special assembly and targeting mechanisms and have their own telomere maintenance systems that allow the element to control the chromosome end. These bacteria thus need to preserve the transposon, which ensures its survival and shapes how it exchanges genetic information. —Di Jiang Eukaryotes have linear DNA, and their telomeres are hotspots for transposons, which in some cases took over telomere maintenance. We identified several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . Although these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, substantially influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.},

Kim et al . reviewed recent developments in the field of complex frequency excitations in photonics and in other fields of physics governed by wave equations. In this excitation scheme, the signal pulses exponentially grow or decrease in amplitude over time. This dynamical behavior allows passive systems to mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to non-Hermitian responses without specific material modifications and leading to exotic optical effects. Applicable to wave systems in general, such complex excitations can be applied to developments in metamaterials, optical computing, sensing, and image processing. —Ian S. Osborne Closed, lossless optical cavities are characterized by a Hamiltonian that obeys Hermiticity, resulting in strictly real-valued resonance frequencies. By contrast, non-Hermitian wave systems are characterized by Hamiltonians with poles and zeros at complex frequencies, whose control through precise engineering of material loss and gain can lead to exotic scattering phenomena. Notably, excitation signals that oscillate at complex-valued frequencies can mimic the emergence of gain and loss, facilitating access to these non-Hermitian responses without material modifications. These findings have been advancing the fundamental understanding of wave-matter interactions and are enabling breakthroughs in metamaterials, imaging, sensing, and computing.

  abstract     = {Plant immunity relies heavily on intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, which can act as either receptors or signal transducers to facilitate disease resistance. In wheat and barley, an alternative class of genes called the tandem kinases also contribute to disease resistance. Two papers in this issue elucidate how tandem kinases work, showing that wheat tandem kinases require an NLR to function. Chen et al . found a pathogen effector that triggers the action of the wheat Sr62 tandem kinase. They demonstrate that the effector interacts with Sr62’s active kinase domain, enabling a pseudokinase domain to activate the corresponding NLR. In parallel, Lu et al . found that a different tandem kinase, WTK3, activates the same NLR as Sr62, and that this NLR acts as a calcium ion channel once activated. Together, these studies solidify the role of NLRs as hubs for immune signaling in response to diverse pathogens and will guide breeding efforts for disease-resistant wheat. —Madeleine Seale Tandem kinase proteins underlie the innate immune systems of cereal plants, but how they initiate plant immune responses remains unclear. This report identifies wheat protein wheat tandem NBD 1 (WTN1), a noncanonical nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor featuring tandem nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, plant R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC) domains, required for WTK3-mediated disease resistance. Both WTK3 and its allelic variant Rwt4—known for conferring resistance to wheat powdery mildew and blast, respectively—are capable of recognizing the blast effector PWT4. They activate WTN1 to form calcium-permeable channels, akin to ZAR1 and Sr35. Thus, tandem kinase proteins and their associated NLRs operate as “sensor-executor” pairs against fungal pathogens. Additionally, evolutionary analyses reveal a coevolutionary trajectory of the tandem kinase-NLR module, highlighting their cooperative role in triggering plant immunity.},

This mixture resulted in precipitates of nanoscale clusters of Cu 3 Li coated with Ta. This core-shell structure neither dissolves nor coarsens at temperatures of up to 800°C while also causing the yielding strength to be in excess of 1 gigapascal. —Marc S. Lavine We present a bulk nanocrystalline copper alloy that can operate at near-melting temperatures with minimal coarsening and creep deformation. The thermal stability of the Cu-3Ta-0.5Li atomic % (at %) alloy is attributed to coherent, ordered L1 2 Cu 3 Li precipitates surrounded by a tantalum-rich atomic bilayer phase boundary complexion. Adding 0.5 at % lithium to the immiscible Cu-Ta system changes the morphology of the nanoscale precipitates from spherical to cuboidal while simultaneously tailoring the phase boundary. The resultant complexion-stabilized nanoscale precipitates provide excellent thermal stability, strength, and creep resistance.

Seo et al . combined soil moisture data from satellites, measurements of sea level, and observations of polar motion to estimate terrestrial water storage over the past four decades, which revealed a dramatic decline (see the Perspective by Samaniego). During the interval from 2000 to 2002, terrestrial water storage decreased by nearly twice as much as Greenland ice mass loss over the same period. —Jesse Smith Rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures have caused substantial changes in terrestrial water circulation and land surface water fluxes, such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, potentially leading to abrupt shifts in terrestrial water storage. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) soil moisture (SM) product reveals a sharp depletion during the early 21st century. During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland’s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002–2006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise (~4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift (~45 centimeters). Precipitation deficits and stable evapotranspiration likely caused this decline, and SM has not recovered as of 2021, with future recovery unlikely under present climate conditions.},

  abstract     = {Plant immunity relies heavily on intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, which can act as either receptors or signal transducers to facilitate disease resistance. In wheat and barley, an alternative class of genes called the tandem kinases also contribute to disease resistance. Two papers in this issue elucidate how tandem kinases work, showing that wheat tandem kinases require an NLR to function. Chen et al . found a pathogen effector that triggers the action of the wheat Sr62 tandem kinase. They demonstrate that the effector interacts with Sr62’s active kinase domain, enabling a pseudokinase domain to activate the corresponding NLR. In parallel, Lu et al . found that a different tandem kinase, WTK3, activates the same NLR as Sr62, and that this NLR acts as a calcium ion channel once activated. Together, these studies solidify the role of NLRs as hubs for immune signaling in response to diverse pathogens and will guide breeding efforts for disease-resistant wheat. —Madeleine Seale The role of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors in plant immunity is well studied, but the function of a class of tandem kinases (TKs) that confer disease resistance in wheat and barley remains unclear. In this study, we show that the SR62 locus is a digenic module encoding the Sr62 TK TK and an NLR (Sr62 NLR ), and we identify the corresponding AvrSr62 effector. AvrSr62 binds to the N-terminal kinase 1 of Sr62 TK , triggering displacement of kinase 2, which activates Sr62 NLR . Modeling and mutation analysis indicated that this is mediated by overlapping binding sites (i) on kinase 1 for binding AvrSr62 and kinase 2 and (ii) on kinase 2 for binding kinase 1 and Sr62 NLR . Understanding this two-component resistance complex may help engineering and breeding plants for durable resistance.},

  abstract     = {US police detain racial or ethnic minority drivers (Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic) more than white drivers. However, a longstanding debate remains unsettled: Does this necessarily reflect police bias? Hypothetically, if minorities were more prone to disobey speed limits and traffic laws, then their traffic stops may be warranted. To put this debate to rest, Aggarwal et al . examined rideshare data from Lyft in the state of Florida to compare minority drivers with their white counterparts. Lyft objectively measured drivers’ locations, driving speed, and location speed limits (see the Perspective by Knox and Mummolo). White and minority drivers showed no discernible differences in speeding behaviors or traffic violations. However, when both drove at identical speeds, police were still 33% more likely to issue speeding citations to minority drivers and charged 34% more expensive fines, unequivocally revealing bias. —Ekeoma Uzogara Prior research on racial profiling has found that in encounters with law enforcement, minorities are punished more severely than white civilians. Less is known about the causes of these encounters and their implications for our understanding of racial profiling. Using high-frequency location data of rideshare drivers in Florida ( N = 222,838 individuals), we estimate the effect of driver race on citations and fines for speeding using 19.3 million location pings. Compared with a white driver traveling the same speed, we find that racial or ethnic minority drivers are 24 to 33% more likely to be cited for speeding and pay 23 to 34% more money in fines. We find no evidence that accident and reoffense rates explain these estimates, which suggests that an animus against minorities underlies our results.},

  abstract     = {Demography is critical for understanding how genetic variation has moved through time and space, and thus the selective and stochastic forces involved. However, these patterns are difficult to determine from modern genomes alone because different scenarios can result in similar genomic outcomes. Grundler et al . created a method using ancestral recombination graphs to trace the spatiotemporal history of DNA segments shared between modern humans (see the Perspective by Gravel). They predicted the least costly migration paths for their sampled individuals back through 200,000 years ago, showing that the most likely path out of Africa was the northern route. This method may prove useful in other species and could provide an alternate way to account for shared ancestry in genetic studies. —Corinne N. Simonti Describing the distribution of genetic variation across individuals is a fundamental goal of population genetics. We present a method that capitalizes on the rich genealogical information encoded in genomic tree sequences to infer the geographic locations of the shared ancestors of a sample of sequenced individuals. We used this method to infer the geographic history of genetic ancestry of a set of human genomes sampled from Europe, Asia, and Africa, accurately recovering major population movements on those continents. Our findings demonstrate the importance of defining the spatiotemporal context of genetic ancestry when describing human genetic variation and caution against the oversimplified interpretations of genetic data prevalent in contemporary discussions of race and ancestry.},

These signals come from a rich collection of receptors that exist in the skin. Ha et al . developed a single actuator unit that can exert complex combinations of dynamic forces, including pressure, shear, vibration, displacement, and torque, to achieve haptic information transfer and realistic virtual tactile sensations. The authors demonstrate the application of this system in hand navigation, reproduction of textural sensation, and tactile perception of music, with a broader goal of using the actuator for biomedical and extended reality applications. —Marc S. Lavine The sense of touch conveys critical environmental information, facilitating object recognition, manipulation, and social interaction, and can be engineered through haptic actuators that stimulate cutaneous receptors. An unfulfilled challenge lies in haptic interface technologies that can engage all the various mechanoreceptors in a programmable, spatiotemporal fashion across large areas of the body. Here, we introduce a small-scale actuator technology that can impart omnidirectional, superimposable, dynamic forces to the surface of skin, as the basis for stimulating individual classes of mechanoreceptors or selected combinations of them. High-bit haptic information transfer and realistic virtual tactile sensations are possible, as illustrated through human subject perception studies in extended reality applications that include advanced hand navigation, realistic texture reproduction, and sensory substitution for music perception.},

Sun et al . report the application of a class of sulfonyl hydrazide reactants that do not require external reduction. Simple heating with nickel catalysts forges a wide variety of carbon-carbon bonds to alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and aryl partners through a radical pathway. —Jake S. Yeston Sulfonyl hydrazides are stable and usually crystalline substances that can be accessed in a variety of ways, including transiently from hydrazones, to achieve a net reductive arylation of carbonyl compounds. We show their utility as versatile radical precursors, as exemplified with seven C–C bond–forming, redox-neutral cross-couplings with activated olefins, alkyl halides, redox-active esters, aryl halides, alkenyl halides, alkynyl halides, and a trifluoromethylating reagent, to forge C(sp 3 )-C(sp 3 ), C(sp 3 )-C(sp 2 ), and C(sp 3 )-C(sp) bonds. Exogenous redox (chemical, photo/electrochemical) additives are not necessary because these functional groups serve the dual role of radical precursor and electron donor.

This article begins by explaining how Chinese policy-makers have recently stepped up efforts to guide science in keeping with national priorities, including economic, environmental, and national security concerns. It then notes an important countercurrent, particularly the growing interest in “original innovation” and the appreciation that curiosity-driven research has a role to play in this regard.

  abstract     = {Singers in a choir are separated by distances, but their voices are perfectly synchronized to make a harmony. Similarly, particles in a quantum system are entangled to share some correlated feature even if they are far away. This phenomenon, called quantum entanglement ( 1 ), is important for quantum information processing but highly sensitive to decoherence (loss of quantum properties) ( 2 ). Exposure to uncontrolled environments, such as thermal fluctuations, causes entangled particles to pick up random noises, which leads to a so-called mixed state. Fortunately, there are ways to “filter” a mixed state back into a pure entangled state by engineering a quantum bath (or reservoir)—a controlled environment to which the system is coupled ( 3 , 4 ). On page 1424 of this issue, Selim et al. ( 5 ) report a new way to filter entangled photons by exploiting a fundamental physics concept that is extensively applied in classical context, called non-Hermitian symmetries. This could offer a new way of solving a key challenge in quantum technology.},

  abstract     = {The capacity to store energy as fat enables animals to ensure energy reserves for the future. In this context, eating beyond satiety (fullness) is a beneficial, adaptive behavior. However, in many human populations, this adaptive behavior is made maladaptive by readily available, energy-dense sources of food, resulting in high rates of obesity. One such behavior, called invigoration, causes an increase in speed, duration, and intake of a palatable food ( 1 ). The neural mechanisms underlying this behavior are not yet clear. On page 1376 of this issue, Zhu et al . ( 2 ) report a brain circuit that drives feeding invigoration in mice. This circuit begins with neurons in the area around the locus coeruleus (periLC) and results in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. The finding provides a neural target, the therapeutic modulation of which might enable changes to food intake by preventing invigoration.},

  abstract     = {Human genomes contain rich information about the past; even a single sequenced genome can be used to summarize patterns of human relatedness going back hundreds of thousands of years ( 1 ). The genomes of hundreds of thousands of individuals are now sequenced every year, providing the potential for ever-increasing resolution in our understanding of human history. However, the interpretation of these rich data in terms of evolutionary hypotheses is challenging. On page 1391 of this issue, Grundler et al. ( 2 ) introduce GAIA, a statistical approach that seeks to learn the geographic position of every genetic ancestor of individuals included in a genome dataset. This approach can help to identify the complex relationships between ancestral populations that shaped the genetic diversity of humans today.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between atmospheric carbon levels and global temperature dates back to 1895, when Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius argued that variations in carbon dioxide concentrations could affect Earth’s heat budget. How climate warming affects Earth’s hydrological cycle—the continuous water movement between Earth and the atmosphere—is a key question for managing water resources and making weather predictions. Although local and regional changes in the water cycle have been observed ( 1 , 2 ), conclusive proof of a global-scale shift has been elusive. Answering this question requires decades of global mean sea level data and advanced climate and hydrological modeling. On page 1408 of this issue, Seo et al . ( 3 ) report how the integration of multiple global geophysical datasets reveals a permanent decline in terrestrial water storage. The study provides robust evidence of an irreversible shift in terrestrial water sources under the present changes in climate.},
