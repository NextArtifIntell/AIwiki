  abstract     = {This paper considers a single machine identical-jobs order scheduling problem with a position-dependent learning effect (SIOSLE) to minimize the total tardiness. A learning effect is common in the identical-jobs order manufacturing, such as clothing, bicycles, shoes, and so on, but its impact on the order scheduling problem has not been studied, especially for orders with different numbers of the same type of jobs. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is first formulated for SIOSLE and serves as a benchmark. A new branch-and-bound algorithm was developed to handle computational complexity based on the Dominance, Split, Elimination, and Decomposition rules revised from the traditional job scheduling problem and new lower and upper bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm is computationally better than the performance of using Gurobi, a popular commercial solver, to solve the MIP. The experiments for large-sized problems found that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm can solve instances with up to 120 orders. The algorithm is more efficient for instances with a strong or weak learning effect, with tight or loose due dates, or with heterogeneous due dates. The effectiveness of the Dominance, Split, Elimination, and Decomposition rules varies with parameter settings. In addition, the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm can yield better solutions than traditional meta-heuristic algorithms but may require longer run time for large instances.},

  abstract     = {We describe a diving heuristic framework based on constraint propagation for mixed integer linear programs. The proposed approach is an extension of the common fix-and-propagate scheme, with the addition of solution repairing after each step. The repair logic is loosely based on the WalkSAT strategy for boolean satisfiability. Different strategies for variable ranking and value selection, as well as other options, yield different diving heuristics. The overall method is relatively inexpensive, as it is basically LP-free: the full linear programming relaxation is solved only at the beginning (and only for the ranking strategies that make use of it), while additional, typically much smaller, LPs are only used to compute values for the continuous variables (if any), once at the bottom of a dive. While individual strategies are not very robust in finding feasible solutions on a heterogeneous testbed, a portfolio approach proved quite effective. In particular, it could consistently find feasible solutions in 189 out of 240 instances from the public MIPLIB 2017 benchmark testbed, in a matter of a few seconds of runtime. The framework has also been implemented inside the commercial MIP solver Xpress and shown to give a small performance improvement in time to optimality on a large internal heterogeneous testbed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce an open-source software package written in C++ for efficiently finding solutions to quadratic programming problems with linear complementarity constraints. These problems arise in a wide range of applications in engineering and economics, and they are challenging to solve due to their structural violation of standard constraint qualifications, and highly nonconvex, nonsmooth feasible sets. This work extends a previously presented algorithm based on a sequential convex programming approach applied to a standard penalty reformulation. We examine the behavior of local convergence and introduce new algorithmic features. Competitive performance profiles are presented in comparison to state-of-the-art solvers and solution variants in both existing and new benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider regression problems subject to noise in the operator or design matrix. This characterization appropriately models many physical phenomena with uncertainty in the regressors. Although the problem has been studied extensively for ordinary/total least squares, and via models that implicitly or explicitly assume Gaussianity, less attention has been paid to improving estimation for regression problems under general independent component-wise uncertainty in the design matrix. To address difficulties encountered when dealing with distributions of sums of random variables, we rely on the saddle point method to estimate densities and form an approximate log-likelihood to maximize. We show that the proposed method performs favorably against other classical methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the description and computation of the B-differential of the componentwise minimum of two affine vector functions. This issue arises in the reformulation of the linear complementarity problem with the Min C-function. The question has many equivalent formulations and we identify some of them in linear algebra, convex analysis and discrete geometry. These formulations are used to state some properties of the B-differential, like its symmetry, condition for its completeness, its connectivity, bounds on its cardinality, etc. The set to specify has a finite number of elements, which may grow exponentially with the range space dimension of the functions, so that its description is most often algorithmic. We first present an incremental-recursive approach avoiding to solve any optimization subproblem, unlike several previous approaches. It is based on the notion of matroid circuit and the related introduced concept of stem vector. Next, we propose modifications, adapted to the problem at stake, of an algorithm introduced by Rada and Černý (SIAM J Discret Math 32(1):455-473, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1027930 ) to determine the cells of an arrangement in the space of hyperplanes having a point in common. Measured in CPU time on the considered test-problems, the mean acceleration ratios of the proposed algorithms, with respect to the one of Rada and Černý, are in the range 15..31, and this speed-up can exceed 100, depending on the problem, the approach and the chosen linear optimization and matroid solvers.},
