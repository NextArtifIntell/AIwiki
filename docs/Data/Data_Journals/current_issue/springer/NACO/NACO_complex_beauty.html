  abstract     = {In this study, we synthesize a novel dynamical approach for ant colonies enabling them to migrate to new nest sites in a self-organizing fashion. In other words, we realize ant colony migration as a self-organizing phenotype-level collective behavior. For this purpose, we first segment the edges of the graph of ants’ pathways. Then, each segment, attributed to its own pheromone profile, may host an ant. So, multiple ants may occupy an edge at the same time. Thanks to this segment-wise edge formulation, ants have more selection options in the course of their pathway determination, thereby increasing the diversity of their colony’s emergent behaviors. In light of the continuous pheromone dynamics of segments, each edge owns a spatio-temporal piece-wise continuous pheromone profile in which both deposit and evaporation processes are unified. The passive dynamics of the proposed migration mechanism is sufficiently rich so that an ant colony can migrate to the vicinity of a new nest site in a self-organizing manner without any external supervision. In particular, we perform extensive simulations to test our migration dynamics applied to a colony including 500 ants traversing a pathway graph comprising 200 nodes and 4000 edges which are segmented based on various resolutions. The obtained results exhibit the effectiveness of our strategy.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir Computing is a computing model ideal for performing computation on varied physical substrates. However, these physical reservoirs can be difficult to scale up. We propose joining various reservoirs together as an approach to solving this problem, simulating physical reservoirs with Echo State Networks (ESNs). We investigate various methods of combining ESNs to form larger reservoirs, including a method that we dub Restricted ESNs. We provide a notation for describing Restricted ESNs, and use it to benchmark a standard ESN against restricted ones. We investigate two methods to keep the weight matrix density consistent when comparing a Restricted ESN to a standard one, which we call overall consistency and patch consistency. We benchmark restricted ESNs on NARMA10 and the sunspot prediction benchmark, and find that restricted ESNs perform similarly to standard ones. We present some application scenarios in which restricted ESNs may offer advantages over standard ESNs. We then test restricted ESNs on a version of the multi-timescale Multiple Superimposed Sines tasks, in order to establish a baseline performance that can be improved upon in further work. We conclude that we can scale up reservoir performance by linking small homogeneous subreservoirs together without significant loss in performance over a single large reservoir, justifying future work on using heterogeneous subreservoirs for greater flexibility.},

  abstract     = {Card-based cryptography allows us to securely compute arbitrary functions using a deck of physical cards. Its performance is mainly measured by the number of used cards and shuffles, and there is a line of work that aims to reduce either of them. One seminal work is the card-based garbled circuit technique by Shinagawa and Nuida (Discret Appl Math 289:248–261, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2020.10.013 ), which allows the construction of a card-based protocol for any Boolean function with a single shuffle. Their construction requires $$2n + 24g$$ cards for an n-input Boolean function that is represented by g logical gates. In this paper, we reduce the number of cards to $$2n + 8g$$ for arbitrary functions while keeping it working with only one shuffle. In addition, we propose two types of extensions to support numerical encoding and multi-input gates. In the extended scheme, the free-ADD technique, obtained by generalizing the free-XOR technique by Manabe and Shinagawa (Deng J, Kolesnikov V, Schwarzmann AA (eds) CANS 2023, LNCS, vol 14342. Springer, Singapore, pp 232–248, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-7563-1-11 ), is available.

  abstract     = {From available data, we show strong positive spatial correlations in the qubits of a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing chip that are connected to qubits outside their own unit cell. Then, by simulating the dynamics of three different spin networks and two different initial conditions, we then show that correlation between nodes is affected by a number of factors. The different connectivity of qubits within the network means that information transfer is not straightforward even when all the qubit-qubit couplings have equal weighting. Connected nodes behave even more dissimilarly when the couplings’ strength is scaled according to the physical length of the connections (here to simulate dipole-dipole interactions). This highlights the importance of understanding the architectural features and potentially unprogrammed interactions/connections that can divert the performance of a quantum system away from the idealised model of identical qubits and couplings across the chip.},

  abstract     = {Flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) have gained significant attention within the research community due to the widespread availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the electronic components required for their control and connectivity. Various applications, such as 3D mapping, construction inspection, and emergency response operations, stand to benefit from leveraging a swarm of UAVs instead of a single UAV. This necessitates the establishment of an ad-hoc network for communication and coordination. An important aspect of implementing FANETs involves autonomously determining the optimal position of the UAVs to ensure communications with the ground nodes while maximizing coverage and connectivity to a remote server. In this research, an application of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to achieve optimal positioning of the UAVs facilitating air-to-ground communications to several ground nodes whose positions within the grid are unknown. The performance of the PSO algorithm is compared with fixed and hybrid models across varying grid sizes (1000 × 1000 and 1500 × 1500), numbers of UAVs (N = 3, …, 9), and numbers of sensor nodes (n = 10, 20, and 30). The log-normal propagation model is considered to account for channel fading effects resulting from multipath propagation.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of determining the size of the smallest tile set that uniquely self-assembles into a given target shape in Winfree’s abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), an elegant theoretical model of DNA tile self-assembly. This problem is also known as the “directed tile complexity” problem. We prove two main results related to the directed tile complexity problem within a variant of the aTAM in which the minimum binding strength threshold (temperature) is set to 1. For our first result, self-assembly happens in a “just-barely 3D” setting, where self-assembling unit cubes are allowed to be placed in the $$z=0$$ and $$z=1$$ planes. This is the same setting in which Furcy, Summers and Withers (DNA 2021) recently proved lower and upper bounds on the directed tile complexity of a just-barely 3D $$k \times N$$ rectangle at temperature 1 of $$\Omega \left( N^{\frac{1}{k}}\right) $$ and $$O\left( N^{\frac{1}{k-1}}+\log N\right) $$ , respectively, the latter of which does not hold for $$k=2$$ . Our first result closes this gap for $$k=2$$ by proving an asymptotically tight bound of $$\Theta (N)$$ on the directed tile complexity of a just-barely 3D $$2 \times N$$ rectangle at temperature 1. Our proof uses a novel process by which a just-barely 3D assembly sequence is “unfolded” to an equivalent 2D assembly sequence. For our second result, we use the aforementioned lower bound by Furcy, Summers and Withers and a novel process that is complementary-in-spirit to our 3D-to-2D unfolding process, by which we “fold” a 2D tile assembly to an equivalent just-barely 3D assembly to prove a new lower bound on the directed tile complexity of a 2D $$k \times N$$ rectangle at temperature 1 of $$\Omega \left( \frac{N^{\frac{2}{k + (k \bmod 2)}}}{k} \right) $$ . For fixed k, our new bound gives a nearly quadratic improvement over, and matches for general even values of $$k &lt; \frac{\log N}{\log \log N - \log \log \log N}$$ the state of the art lower bound on the directed tile complexity of a $$k \times N$$ rectangle at temperature 1 by Furcy, Summers and Wendlandt (DNA 2019) of $$\Omega \left( N^{\frac{1}{k}}\right) $$ . While both of our results represent improvements over previous corresponding state of the art results, the proofs thereof are facilitated by novel examples of reasoning about tile self-assembly happening in 2D (just-barely 3D) as though it is happening in just-barely 3D (2D).},

  abstract     = {Any countable (infinite or not) linear (total) ordering can be represented by displaying all its elements on an axis in increasing order. Such a representation can be generated using only geometrical constructions based on coloured line segment extensions and rules to handle segment intersections. After a bounded time, the construction segments disappear and only the representation remains. The process starts with finitely many segments, so that unbounded acceleration effects are used to generate infinitely many segments for the representation. There is no outside machinery nor operator: any needed computation has to be carried out through the drawing. After providing some illustrative examples with ad hoc constructions, we prove our main results. One rational signal machine (bounded to use only rational coordinates) can generate the representation of any decidable linear ordering (i.e. the order between two elements is decidable by a Turing machine). In the general case, there is a signal machine able to generate the representation of any countable linear ordering (encoded in a real number).},

We show this problem is NP-complete when restricted to just two directions (south and west). This answers the simplest fundamental problem in uniform global unit tilt swarm robotics. We then consider a relaxed version of this problem called row relocation in which the goal is to move a robot a to a specific row regardless of its horizontal placement. We show that if asking about the first row of the square grid (bottom-most), then this version of the problem is solvable in polynomial time.
