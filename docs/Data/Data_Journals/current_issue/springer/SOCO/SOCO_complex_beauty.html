Recognizing gender opposition speech contributes to maintaining a healthy online environment and security in cyberspace. Traditional recognition model ignores the Chinese-owned features and emojis, which inevitably affects the recognition accuracy of gender opposition. To tackle this issue, a gender opposition recognition method fusing emojis and multi-features in Chinese speech(GOR-CS) is proposed. Firstly, the exBERT method is employed to expand the encoding of emojis into the BERT vocabulary, which can ensure BERT to extract the basis vectors containing characters and emojis information. Then, the feature vectors containing Wubi, Zhengma, and Pinyin information are extracted by Word2Vec to obtain the Chinese-owned features of gender opposition text. Further, the proposed basis vector and feature vectors are fused and then fed into the Bi-GRU network to extract deeper semantics from input sentences. Finally, to determine whether the speech are related to gender opposition, the sentiment polarities are calculated with the fully connected layer and SoftMax function. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of gender opposition recognition.},

  abstract     = {For many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based applications, especially those that need to operate with resource-limited edge networked devices in real-time, it is crucial to have a lightweight computing model for data processing and analysis. In this study, we focus on UAV-based forest fire imagery detection using a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN). The task is challenging owing to complex image backgrounds and insufficient training samples. Specifically, we enhance the MobileNetV2 model with an attention mechanism for UAV-based image classification. The proposed model first employs a transfer learning strategy that leverages the pre-trained weights from ImageNet to expedite learning. Then, the model incorporates randomly initialised weights and dropout mechanisms to mitigate over-fitting during training. In addition, an ensemble framework with a majority voting scheme is adopted to improve the classification performance. A case study on forest fire scenes classification with benchmark and real-world images is demonstrated. The results on a publicly available UAV-based image data set reveal the competitiveness of our proposed model as compared with those from existing methods. In addition, based on a set of self-collected images with complex backgrounds, the proposed model illustrates its generalisation capability to undertake forest fire classification tasks with aerial images.},

  abstract     = {Accurate identification of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) borders is time-consuming, relying heavily on the neurosurgeon expertise in manually interpreting the electrophysiological signals. Local field potentials (LFPs) have garnered imperative attention due to their strong correlation with the STN. However, existing detection models often face challenges with high computational complexity, hyperparameter optimization and lack of explainability, making them unreliable for clinicians. Therefore, this study introduces an explanatory framework using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for detecting the STN region from LFPs. Continuous wavelet transform is employed to convert LFPs signals into scalogram images, which are then processed by sixteen CNN models. We evaluated our framework by examining the impact of various limiting factors on the classification performance, including model size, learning rate (LR), optimizers and data scaling. Deep features are extracted from the top-performing CNN architectures to capture rich representations of the scalograms. These features are then fused and classified using k-nearest neighbour algorithm. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping is used to explain the decisions made by the proposed model. Our approach achieved an accuracy of 99.61%, outperforming individual CNN models for STN localization. The experimental results revealed that CNN models, embedded with additional hyperparameters and layers, generally outperformed smaller models. Besides, low LR significantly enhanced the performance compared to high LR. Moreover, features extracted from untuned networks produced lower performance than tuned networks. The proposed system could revolutionize deep brain stimulation surgery by increasing efficiency and reducing reliance on clinician expertise for STN detection.},

The proposed WIT2TFBINN is used for synchronization control of a 4D Lorentz chaotic system and has the benefits of wavelet interval type-2 membership function, TSK fuzzy inference system, decision making, and emotional activity. To provide fast training, the proposed method&#39;s parameter update laws are derived using the gradient descent method. The proposed WIT2TFBINN synchronization technique is then applied to the transmission of medical images in a secure manner. As a cipher image, a medical image is encrypted into a chaotic trajectory. After transmission, the image can be decrypted using chaotic trajectory synchronization on the received signal. The simulation results show that the proposed neural network and the encryption/decryption method are powerful and effective. The results of the static test analysis (histogram, attack analysis, image with noise, image with cropping) show that the encryption/decryption method provides high security.},

The proposed star configuration power grid system consists of n power generation subsystems fixed in star-terminal and one central collection and redistribution subsystem. The star-terminal subsystems with sufficient electric power can first transmit the surplus electric power to the central subsystem, and then the collected electric power in central subsystem is further redistributed to the star-terminal subsystems which are experiencing electric power deficiency through the corresponded transmission links. An algorithm based on the universal generating function (UGF) technique is presented to evaluate the dynamic reliability of the proposed power grid system with performance sharing. Finally, a numerical example and a case study are used to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed model and method. Studies indicate that the steady reliability of the proposed power grid system is improved by 9.41% and 37.28% for the numerical example when comparing the calculation results between performance sharing, unlimited performance sharing and no performance sharing. In the case study, the dynamic reliability of the proposed power grid system increased by 11.5% when comparing the calculation results between with performance sharing and no performance sharing when $$k\to \infty $$ .},

For this purpose, we establish a model based on two theorems and provide an easy-to-use method to derive the optimal ordering policy to maximize retailers’ total profits.

Various researchers have focussed on disease due to different types of microbial infection in potato leaves using computer vision and machine learning approaches. In this paper, a data science approach for multiclass classification of potato normal and abnormal leaves due to fungal infection like early blight and late blight is performed using the ensembling of deep learning (DL) CNN models. Firstly, the performance of classification on potato disease is verified separately on VGG16 and ResNet-50 CNN models after pre-processing of the leaf dataset. The pre-processing includes noise removal and normalization. Further improvement in classification accuracy is achieved by the ensembling of VGG16 and ResNet-50 CNN models. The ensembling of CNN models is performed on the feature level by fusing features extracted using VGG16 and ResNet-50. From the experimental results, performed on publicly available datasets consisting of 2152 number of normal and abnormal images it is observed that the average classification accuracy of 98.22%, 96.16% and 95.68% is achieved using the proposed ensemble, VGG16 and ResNet-50 models respectively. The efficacy of the proposed approach (ensemble technique at feature level fusion) is verified in comparison with recently reported DL model-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), topology control aims to optimize the network structure to improve its performance and is a significant issue especially in mesh connected networks. As Industrial Wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) adopt a mesh-based strategy for communication, a connected topology and its maintenance is necessary. Therefore, identifying candidate nodes and reconfiguration under congestion and failure for reliable connection becomes important. A rank-based mechanism appears a viable solution to identify next best candidates to establish the connections among the nodes in the event of network disruption. As a solution, we propose adoption of MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision-Making) based approach to compute the ranks among the sensor nodes when subject to varied constraints. Our paper compares and analyses the ranking of a node by using two methods, Analytical hierarchy Process (AHP) Weighted TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and FUZZY TOPSIS. A novel application of the rank-based strategy to determine the connection between the nodes for achieving a network with lower energy consumption and better connectivity for IWSNs is presented. On comparison with standard topology control algorithms, like connected dominating set (CDS) and articulation point strategy our results confirm that the topology formed through our ranking method achieves lower energy consumption in communication and better connectivity probability among the nodes. Further, we also observe performance of the network when subject to obstacles in the line-of-sight communication typical of IWSNs and our approach performs better in this case too.},

  abstract     = {With the gradual development and application of modern intelligent technology in our country, it has become a key factor influencing the nation&#39;s overall competitive strength. The state has explicitly proposed the establishment of efficient and high-quality engineering projects in the current sports industry. By applying innovative technologies, smart sports venues will be created to support the future development of the nation and the sports sector, thereby comprehensively enhancing the country&#39;s overall competitive strength. Among these, university gyms, as important venues for modern school physical education, must keep pace with the nation&#39;s development. By establishing smart sports venues and utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology, cloud computing technology, and artificial intelligence technology, the comprehensive operation of sports venues can be promoted, leading to the stable development of the school sports industry. The design quality evaluation for college smart sports venues is a multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. Recently, the TODIM and TOPSIS methods have been demonstrated to address MAGDM issues. Hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) have been introduced as a means to characterize uncertain data during the design quality evaluation for college smart sports venues. In this study, the hesitant fuzzy TODIM-TOPSIS (HF-TODIM-TOPSIS) approach is proposed to solve MADM problems under HFSs. Finally, a numerical study for the design quality evaluation of college smart sports venues is presented to validate the proposed approach. The major contributions of this study are as follows: (1) The TODIM and TOPSIS methods are extended to HFSs; (2) Entropy is used to determine the weight values under HFSs; (3) The HF-TODIM-TOPSIS approach is established to handle MADM problems under HFSs; (4) Algorithm analysis and comparison for the design quality evaluation of college smart sports venues are conducted based on a numerical example to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the HF-TODIM-TOPSIS approach.},

  abstract     = {The intricate nature of modern edge architectures, relying on a vast array of computational logic and lightweight communication protocols, creates vulnerabilities that expose them to a broad spectrum of security threats. Moreover, security vulnerabilities can significantly impact the energy footprint of edge servers in these architectures. Our approach utilizes the concurrent stochastic game (CSG) formalism to model the behavior of IoT communication entities (players) while accounting for potential attacks at the communication edge and the resulting energy consumption caused by such attacks. We rely on the PRISM-games language for automated analysis where the game goals modeling functional and security requirements are expressed using reward probabilistic alternating temporal logic (rPATL). To validate our approach, we examine a data corruption attack applied to dam water flow control and study its side effect on energy consumption associated with SensiNact gateways. Our key innovation lies in using formal models at the architectural level to explore potential attacks. These models capture synchronous and asynchronous communication styles, along with their associated energy consumption. The methodology and the implemented formalism offer a significant advancement over traditional game equation models while still achieving the desired security and energy evaluation. Numerical results show that compared to synchronous communication, asynchronous styles suffer from significantly larger infected buffers and higher energy consumption due to attacks ranging from 66 to 91%.},

  abstract     = {Software defect prediction (SDP) is considered a dynamic research problem and is beneficial during the testing stage of the software development life cycle. Several artificial intelligence-based methods were available to predict these software defects. However, the detection accuracy is still low due to imbalanced datasets, poor feature learning, and tuning of the model&#39;s parameters. This paper proposes a novel attention-included Deep Learning (DL) model for SDP with effective feature learning and dimensionality reduction mechanisms. The system mainly comprises ‘6’ phases: dataset balancing, source code parsing, word embedding, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification. First, dataset balancing was performed using the density peak based k-means clustering (DPKMC) algorithm, which prevents the model from having biased outcomes. Then, the system parses the source code into abstract syntax trees (ASTs) that capture the structure and relationship between different elements of the code to enable type checking and the representative nodes on ASTs are selected to form token vectors. Then, we use bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), which converts the token vectors into numerical vectors and extracts semantic features from the data. We then input the embedded vectors to multi-head attention incorporated bidirectional gated recurrent unit (MHBGRU) for contextual feature learning. After that, the dimensionality reduction is performed using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), which transforms the higher dimensional data into lower dimensions and removes irrelevant features. Finally, the system used a deep, fully connected network-based SoftMax layer for defect prediction, in which the cross-entropy loss is utilized to minimize the prediction loss. The experiments on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and AEEEM show that the system achieves better outcomes than the existing state-of-the-art models for SDP.},

We incorporate the Stackelberg game strategy across multiple colonies, where the leader guides the follower to optimize population co-evolution, ensuring a balance between convergence and diversity of the algorithm. Furthermore, we propose an incremental learning strategy that enhances efficient paths on the public routes and ignores inefficient ones, thus accelerating the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, when the algorithm stagnates, a pheromone balance mechanism is implemented to help the ants escape from local optima. We conducted experiments on 23 TSP instances to validate the algorithm&#39;s performance and compare it to ACS, MMAS, as well as other recent algorithms. In addition, non-parametric tests were conducted for comprehensive performance analysis. Moreover, we verified the feasibility of SGIACO through simulations in robot path planning scenarios. The experimental results show that SGIACO has good convergence and accuracy, which is competitive with other algorithms. Future research aims to scale SGIACO for larger real-world applications, enhancing its adaptability and scalability.},

  abstract     = {An artificial tree (AT) algorithm has been proposed recently, and the performance of AT has been enhanced because of the introduction of improved AT algorithm with two-population (IATTP). However, the branch update operators of IATTP cannot effectively balance exploration and exploitation, which limits the optimization accuracy and efficiency of IATTP. To further improve the performance of IATTP, this work proposes a two-population artificial tree algorithm based on adaptive updating strategy for dominant populations (TATAD). In TATAD, six operators named self-evolution operator 2, crossover operator 2, improved self-evolution operator, gradient descent update operator, Gauss and Cauchy variational operator, and random traceless Sigma variational operator are applied to form an operator library. A dominant operator dynamic following mechanism is proposed to assign these six operators to the two populations in an optimal pairing scheme. Both populations and operators compete with each other, and the advantages of all operators are fully utilized. Moreover, the combination of diverse operators and dominant operator dynamic following mechanism can effectively balance the exploration and exploitation of TATAD. The performance of TATAD is compared with four AT algorithms and six efficient algorithms through typical test functions, and their results are bested by Wilcoxon rank sum test (WRST) and Friedman ranking test. It is found that TATAD is the most competitive algorithm among these algorithms for solving these optimization problems.},

It comprises the construction of order batches, batch assignment, picker routes, and scheduling of pickers. Therefore, the development of an efficient order picking system and the optimization of these operations have significant effects on the overall efficiency of the warehouse. This paper focuses on studying and modeling the order batching, batch assignment, and picker routing problems in a multi-warehouse, multi-period, multi-picker order picking system. We propose a multi-objective mathematical model for minimizing the delivery times of batches and the total cost of order picking operations. Also, for the first time, a possibilistic approach is applied to overcome uncertain conditions in the order picking problem. Given the complexity of the problem, Benders decomposition is implemented to solve the proposed model. The applicability of the proposed method is evaluated through a range of small to large test problems and an actual case study. The results indicate that the proposed exact method is capable of finding high-quality solutions within a reasonable computational time and number of iterations, which serves as evidence of its suitability for large-scale, complex real-world industrial contexts.},

  abstract     = {The class imbalance problem is one of the challenging issues in various machine learning applications. This problem occurs when the number of instances of a class is much smaller (or larger) than those of the other classes. To handle the imbalanced classification problems, many useful approaches have been developed, for example, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). However, the SMOTE is often sensitive to the predetermined $$k$$ value, i.e., the number of nearest neighbors used to generate the synthetic instances. For example, if the $$k$$ value is moderately large, some of the synthetic instances generated by the SMOTE would be located near a decision boundary or even within the majority class area and thus these can be treated as unnecessary noisy instances. Thus, in this study, we propose an efficient hybrid resampling method based on instance density called IDHR (Instance Density-based Hybrid Resampling) to improve the classification performance by generating instances that are closer to the minority class than the majority class while avoiding generation of noisy instances. For this, we first apply the instance density-based oversampling (IDO) technique to generate new synthetic instances. And then, we eliminate some of the synthetic instances that are close to the decision boundary and determine the number of the synthetic instances among the retained synthetic ones which can be eliminated based on maximum of the distances from all the synthetic instances to the minority class instances and minimum of the distances from all the synthetic instances to the majority class instances as well as classification performances. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resampling method, comprehensive experiments are conducted on sixteen imbalanced datasets with considering three classifiers, i.e., C4.5 decision tree algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN). Through the experimental analysis, it is shown that the proposed resampling method outperforms the traditional oversampling methods with respect to AUC and F-measure for most of the imbalanced datasets regardless of classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Cloud Computing has attracted a lot of interest from both individual users and organization. However, cloud computing applications face certain security issues, such as data integrity, user privacy, and service availability. The only better solution to such issues is to identify and prevent cyber threats before they can cause seriously harm the cloud computing system. Several methods have been suggested so far to detect the attack in cloud computing (CC), but no one method attains satisfactory results. To overwhelm these drawbacks, a Cyber Security Attack Detection using Deep Kernel Machine Learning optimized with Chaotic Invasive Weed Optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper for Cloud Computing. Here, the data is amassed from CSE-CIC-IDS2018 and Bot-IoT datasets. Subsequently, a pre-processing step involving redundancy reduction and missing value replacement for uncertainty removal is achieved through the Developed Random Forest with Local Least Squares (DRFLLS) method. By utilizing Entropy-Kurtosis based feature selection approach, the pre-processing data is given to the feature selection to identify the optimal features. The selected features are supplied to the Deep Kernel Machine Learning classifier (DK-ML), which is optimized using the Chaotic Invasive Weed Optimization algorithm (Chaotic-IWOA) for classification. This classification process classifies the data as normal or anomalous categories with anomalies encompassing, like DoS, DDoS, Theft attacks, and normal attacks. The proposed technique is activated in MATLAB. The proposed technique achieves 24.88%, 17.98%, 45.65%, 35.95% better accuracy for CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset, and 23.93%, 13.94%, 32.94%, and 29.04% better accuracy for Bot-IoT dataset.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of the Web 3.0 era, the amount and types of data in the network have sharply increased, and the application scenarios of recommendation algorithms are continuously expanding. Location recommendation has gradually become one of the popular application scenarios in recommendation algorithms. Traditional recommendation algorithms not only ignore the temporal attribute of data when recommending information to users, but also blindly pursue the recommendation accuracy, which will cause certain “information cocoon room” problems. Therefore, this article treats user historical data as a time series and proposes an LSTM-DNN model based on the novel bidirectional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. Firstly, in response to the issue of different users consuming different amounts of information, this article proposes a novel bidirectional DTW algorithm to calculate the similarity between different users. Secondly, this article supplements the user dataset from three perspectives: “utilization” and “exploration” of information, and spatiotemporal attributes of data, which alleviates the problem of data sparsity and cold start in the dataset to a certain extent. Moreover, it effectively enhances the diversity of recommendation results. Finally, this paper constructs an Long Short-Term Memory-Deep Neural Networks (LSTM-DNN) to dynamically obtain user interests and preferences, and proposes a new metric Cumulative Self-System Diversity (CSSD) to measure the diversity of algorithm recommendation results. Experiments have shown that the model effectively enhances the diversity of recommendation results while ensuring recommendation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Rank aggregation is the combination of several ranked lists from a set of candidates to achieve a better ranking by combining information from different sources. In feature selection problem, due to the heterogeneity of methods, there are some base rankers (Filter-based methods) that are of diverse quality and usually the ground truth of ratings is not available. Existing rank aggregation methods that take the diverse quality of base rankers into account do not have any explicit approach for appropriate weighting, require prior assumptions, and suffers from high computational complexity. In this paper, to overcome these challenges, an efficient unsupervised method is introduced for estimating the base rankers’ qualities and aggregating the rankers based on the estimated weights. We first compute the ratio of disagreement between base rankers in ordering different element pairs and then estimate the accuracies in a way that to minimize the discrepancy between these computed ratios and their analytical counterparts. We use the weighted majority voting method for obtaining the aggregated results. To resolve the probable inconsistencies in the final aggregation, the result is formed as a graph, and a greedy algorithm is used to find an acyclic subgraph with the highest weigh. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, nine standard UCI datasets are used. The obtained results by the proposed method have higher values of classifier measures than the existing baseline Feature Selection methods and rank aggregation-based multi-filter methods in the most datasets. The experiments show that rank aggregation-based Feature Selection methods outperform individual methods. The proposed method also shows the weight of each Filter-based Feature Selection method, in which the MRMR method has a higher weight than other methods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an evaluation strategy is proposed for evaluation of optimization algorithms, called the Complex Preference Analysis, that assesses the efficiency of different evolutionary algorithms by considering multiple performance metrics concurrently across diverse dimensions and generating a single score for ranking. The proposed strategy allows for a thorough evaluation by assigning distinct priorities in the form of weights, to various performance parameters. The algorithm’s performances on each performance parameter are captured and the best and worst performances in each performance category are identified. The deviation of each algorithm from the best and worst performances in the respective performance category is formulated to generate a single score for each of the algorithms for comparison. The flexibility to adjust weights provides a valuable tool for customizing evaluations according to individual needs and preferences. The proposed evaluation strategy is studied by running evaluations on nine evolutionary algorithms based on their performance over five performance indicators on six datasets of the Travelling Salesman Problem. Conducting Complex Preference Analysis on the different evolutionary algorithms reveals distinctive patterns in their performance, with some algorithms such as Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Bat Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, etc. consistently demonstrating superior results across multiple Travelling Salesman Problem instances, while other algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization, Teaching Learning Based Optimization, etc. rank lower. The algorithms’ performances on individual performance parameters, when reflected on the final rank of the algorithms, generated based on the collective impact of all the parameters, elucidate the efficiency of the proposed evaluation strategy.},

  abstract     = {Online social networks have become ubiquitous platforms, comprising intricately linked structures that reflect complex user interactions. Analyzing the interconnected component structure of these large directed graphs is pivotal for critical applications like viral marketing and contagion prediction. This paper presents a parallel algorithm to efficiently discover strongly connected components in massive social graphs by distributing computation across clustered servers. Our proposed distributed approach conducts localized connected component extraction during the Map phase. The merged aggregation in the Reduce phase then uncovers global maximum interconnected sets spanning the fragmented structures. We employ mathematical induction across Map-Reduce stages to demonstrate the algorithm’s correctness for obtaining exhaustive component enumeration across servers. Implementation and complexity analysis on synthetic benchmark graphs highlight significant efficiency gains, with the algorithm demonstrating near-linear speedup for increasing data-set and cluster sizes. The proposed technique advances the state-of-the-art for extracting strongly connected structures from colossal real-world social networks, enabling actionable insights around influence cascades and contagion pathways underlying these intricate linkage patterns.},
