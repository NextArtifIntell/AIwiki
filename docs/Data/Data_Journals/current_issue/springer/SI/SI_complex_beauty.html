  abstract     = {Applications, such as military and disaster response, can benefit from robotic collectives’ ability to perform multiple cooperative tasks (e.g., surveillance, damage assessments) efficiently across a large spatial area. Coalition formation algorithms can potentially facilitate collective robots’ assignment to appropriate task teams; however, most coalition formation algorithms were designed for smaller multiple robot systems (i.e., 2–50 robots). Collectives’ scale and domain-relevant constraints (i.e., distribution, near real-time, minimal communication) make coalition formation more challenging. This manuscript identifies the challenges inherent to designing coalition formation algorithms for very large collectives (e.g., 1000 robots). A survey of multiple robot coalition formation algorithms finds that most are unable to transfer directly to collectives, due to the identified system differences; however, auctions and hedonic games may be the most transferable. A simulation-based evaluation of five total algorithms from two combinatorial auction families and one hedonic game family, applied to homogeneous and heterogeneous collectives, demonstrates that there are collective compositions for which no evaluated algorithm is viable; however, the experimental results and literature survey suggest paths forward.},

  abstract     = {Coordination of local and global aerial traffic has become a legal and technological bottleneck as the number of unmanned vehicles in the common airspace continues to grow. To meet this challenge, automation and decentralization of control is an unavoidable requirement. In this paper, we present a solution that enables self-organization of cooperating autonomous agents into an effective traffic flow state in which the common aerial coordination task—filled with conflicts—is resolved. Using realistic simulations, we show that our algorithm is safe, efficient, and scalable regarding the number of drones and their speed range, while it can also handle heterogeneous agents and even pairwise priorities between them. The algorithm works in any sparse or dense traffic scenario in two dimensions and can be made increasingly efficient by a layered flight space structure in three dimensions. To support the feasibility of our solution, we show stable traffic simulations with up to 5000 agents, and experimentally demonstrate coordinated aerial traffic of 100 autonomous drones within a 250 m wide circular area.},

  abstract     = {Social learning is a collective approach to decentralised decision-making and is comprised of two processes; evidence updating and belief fusion. In this paper we propose a social learning model in which agents’ beliefs are represented by a set of possible states, and where the evidence collected can vary in its level of imprecision. We investigate this model using multi-agent and multi-robot simulations and demonstrate that it is robust to imprecise evidence. Our results also show that certain kinds of imprecise evidence can enhance the efficacy of the learning process in the presence of sensor errors.},
