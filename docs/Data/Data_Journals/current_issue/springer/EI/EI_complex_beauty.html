  abstract     = {The main challenge of multimodal optimization problems is identifying multiple peaks with high accuracy in multidimensional search spaces with irregular landscapes. This work proposes the Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch (MGP-BBBC) algorithm, which addresses the challenge of multimodal optimization problems by introducing a specialized mechanism for each operator. The algorithm expands the Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm, a state-of-the-art metaheuristic inspired by the universe’s evolution. Specifically, MGP-BBBC groups the best individuals of the population into cluster-based centers of mass and then expands them with a progressively lower disturbance to guarantee convergence. During this process, it (i) applies a distance-based filtering to remove unnecessary elites such that the ones on smaller peaks are not lost, (ii) promotes isolated individuals based on their niche count after clustering, and (iii) balances exploration and exploitation during offspring generation to target specific accuracy levels. Experimental results on twenty multimodal benchmark test functions show that MGP-BBBC generally performs better or competitively with respect to other state-of-the-art multimodal optimizers.},

This scoping review included observational studies focused on the use of artificial intelligence to improve the diagnosis of shoulder injuries in magnetic resonance imaging. The studies that mixed joints or whose approach was theoretical were excluded. Regarding the analysis of each study, the data included were study type, population profile, sample size, method of deep learning, outcome variables, accuracy measurements, and statistical significance. 26 studies with a total of 9019 subjects were included. Seven studies focused on the accuracy of segmentation; thirteen, on the diagnosis, five, on the image quality, and one, on the acquisition time. For these purposes, all studies bet on convolutional neural networks, with seven choosing the 3D U-Net model and seven opting for more specific models such as 1-Lipschitz neural network, V-Net, ViVGG19, or CapsNet. Furthermore, six studies opted for the conjunction of models such as block-based AlexNet, GoogLeNet inception v3, ResNet or SqueezeNet with the 3D U-Net model. These models obtained statistically significant improvements in image quality (p = 0.001–0.028) and accuracy of segmentation (p = 0.001–0.043). However, despite obtaining a slight optimization of diagnostic sensitivity, these differences were not significant in all studies (p = 0.001–0.99). Deep learning stands out as a promising tool in the management of imaging tests in shoulder pathology, but more research is required to draw consistent conclusions.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries play a crucial role in our daily lives. Accurately predicting the State of Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Life of lithium-ion batteries is essential. To solve the limitations in prediction accuracy of traditional methods, a new approach is proposed that uses an adaptive convergence factor improved Gold Rush Optimizer (GRO) to optimize a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network for predicting lithium-ion battery capacity. Since the capacity degradation of lithium-ion batteries follows time series patterns, BiLSTM has been chosen to solve this issue effectively. At the same time, to enhance the learning capability of BiLSTM, GRO is used to optimize the network&#39;s weights and bias parameters, resulting in higher prediction accuracy. In addition, an adaptive convergence factor is proposed to balance GRO&#39;s local and global search capabilities. Compared to other neural networks such as Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and BiLSTM, as well as different meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to optimize BiLSTM like Differential Evolution (DE), Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Great Trevally Optimization (GTO), the experimental results show that the optimized model performs better and predicts battery capacity with increased accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Text clustering holds significant value across various domains due to its ability to identify patterns and group related information. Current approaches which rely heavily on a computed similarity measure between documents are often limited in accuracy and interpretability. We present a novel approach to the problem based on a set of evolved search queries. Clusters are formed as the set of documents matched by a single search query in the set of queries. The queries are optimized to maximize the number of documents returned and to minimize the overlap between clusters (documents returned by more than one query). Where queries contain more than one word they are interpreted disjunctively. We have found it useful to assign one word to be the root and constrain the query construction such that the set of documents returned by any additional query words intersect with the set returned by the root word. Not all documents in a collection are returned by any of the search queries in a set, so once the search query evolution is completed a second stage is performed whereby a KNN algorithm is applied to assign all unassigned documents to their nearest cluster. We describe the method and present results using 8 text datasets comparing effectiveness with well-known existing algorithms. We note that as well as achieving the highest accuracy on these datasets the search query format provides the qualitative benefits of being interpretable and modifiable whilst providing a causal explanation of cluster construction.},

Multimodal transportation problems often, however, present optimisation challenges because of their high dimensionality, compounded by network size, modelling criteria, and modes. Among these challenges is computational complexity, which can be reduced with the use of metaheuristic solution approaches that strive to find an acceptable solution within a reasonable timeframe. In addition, as machine learning finds integration within real-world applications, the demand for parallel computing and robust computational infrastructure is on the rise. Given these rapid shifts, this paper is motivated to present a comprehensive systematic literature review on the optimisation of multimodal transportation, focusing on the urban mobility of passengers, using metaheuristics. After conducting a systematic bibliographic search, a thorough classification of studies based on their problem scope, mathematical formulation, methodology, temporal- and network settings is conducted.

  abstract     = {Enhancing the assessment of water quality is essential for sustainable water management, given its critical impact on environmental health and human well-being. Accurate assessment presents several difficulties due to the complexity and variability of water ecosystems. Among the various machine learning techniques employed, Support Vector Regression and Adaptive Boosting have emerged as two of the most widely used and effective methods. In recent years, many evolutionary algorithms have been developed to find approximate solutions to optimization problems. In this study, we investigate how efficient new algorithms consisting of hybrids of machine learning methods and evolutionary algorithms can be for some problems. We extensively investigate Support Vector Regression with various kernels, including linear, radial basis function, polynomial, and sigmoid. In addition, we introduce Modified Support Vector Regression and Modified Adaboost where standalone ML models are combined with the swarm-based algorithms, such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno, and Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python. We apply the proposed hybrid algorithms to the problem of measuring water quality. Accurate modeling and assessment of river water quality are essential endeavors with multifaceted challenges. We focus on the Tigris River modeling in Baghdad Governorate, particularly at three water treatment plants: Eastern Tigris, AL-Karkh, and AL-Wathba. The dataset comprises multiple water quality parameters, with a total dissolved solids target. Incorporating swarm-based algorithms into the adopted models has synergistically enhanced their predictive capabilities, resulting in a significant augmentation of the overall predictive prowess of the ML models. The proposed hybrid algorithms successfully enhanced SVR model performance, with the L-BFGS-B algorithm yielding mean squared error reductions of 46.23% and 28.09% on the East Tigris and Karkh plants, respectively. In comparison, the MSVR-PSO approach reduced the Wathba plant by up to 85.96%. These findings have a significant impact on advancing water treatment plants. A thorough understanding of these variations is required when deciding on the optimal machine learning model for individual applications and generalization for Tigris River water quality scale evaluation and beyond.},

This decision-making process is made more difficult by the lack of a trustworthy food cart evaluation system. This study proposes a model that enables customers to evaluate food carts based on service quality, food quality, and cost-effectiveness. The model applies multi-objective optimization to balance these factors, using three evolutionary algorithms: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic algorithm II, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, and Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm. The proposed system generates Pareto-optimal solutions that guide customers in selecting the best food carts. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed food cart evaluation system can be validated by comparing it with other algorithms in terms of Pareto optimal results, Hypervolume, Generational Distance, Inverted Generation Distance and Epsilon Indicator. The model was validated by Swiggy Food Chain data, which demonstrated that our approach effectively minimizes costs while maximizing food cart ratings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system can significantly enhance customer decision-making in selecting food carts, offering a practical tool for both consumers and the food delivery industry.

Eleven metaheuristic algorithms were compared on multimodal and shifted benchmark functions, uncovering significant differences in their exploration efficiency. Notably, a pervasive flaw—the zero-bias problem—was identified in several algorithms, which artificially boosts performance on certain benchmarks while hindering real-world applicability.

  abstract     = {Metaheuristic algorithms are stochastic optimization techniques inspired by natural phenomena, with their performance driven by two key operators: exploration and exploitation. Despite their success, a common limitation is their susceptibility to premature convergence and slow progress toward optimal solutions. To address these challenges, this study presents an innovative extension of the Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA), a method rooted in charged system search principles. The proposed algorithm incorporates oppositional-based learning (OBL) and an elite chaotic local search mechanism to enhance both global and local search capabilities. OBL improves the exploration of the global search space, while the elite chaotic local search focuses on refining solutions around near-optimal regions, ensuring accelerated convergence. This hybrid approach is tested on CEC2020 bound-constrained numerical optimization problems and real-world applications such as topology optimization and gear train design. The findings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of achieving better optimal solutions, faster convergence rates, and reduced algorithmic complexity when compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Some notable performance of the proposed algorithm are, it demonstrates superior performance over all listed algorithms for 10D problems $$f_1, f_2, f_3, f_5, f_7, f_9, f_{10}$$ , and most 20D problems $$f_1, f_2, f_3, f_5, f_7, f_8, f_9$$ . It shows comparable results with other algorithms for specific cases ( $$f_4, f_6, f_8$$ ) in both 10D and 20D settings, consistently outperforming or matching state-of-the-art alternatives.

  abstract     = {This study presents the Gaussian Combined Arms (GCA) algorithm, a novel metaheuristic approach inspired by military strategies, designed to address high-dimensional and complex optimization challenges in engineering. The algorithm employs a dual-agent strategy by dividing search agents into two coordinated groups: ground forces for intensively refining solutions within promising regions and air forces for extensively exploring the search space to avoid local optima. By integrating Gaussian distribution principles, the GCA algorithm dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring adaptability and efficiency across diverse optimization landscapes. Experimental evaluations are first applied on three sets of test functions, including the standard benchmark set, CEC2017 and CEC2019, followed by several real-world engineering problems, such as Economic Load Dispatch and structural design optimization. The results demonstrate that GCA achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and convergence rates compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms. These findings underscore the potential of GCA as a reliable tool for solving intricate engineering optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {In machine learning, the importance of relevant data increases exponentially. In our proposed approach, we introduce an optimization method that combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Firefly Algorithm (FA) to enhance feature selection using decision tree-based classification. PSO is well-suited for small search spaces, while the Firefly Algorithm is effective for large search spaces. The proposed method, PSOFA-DT aims to improve classification performance by reducing dimensionality and optimizing feature selection. PSO’s global search capabilities are complemented by FA’s localized search, and the algorithm’s effectiveness is evaluated using decision tree accuracy and hold-out cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that PSOFA-DT outperforms individual implementations of PSO and FA in feature reduction and classification accuracy. Decision tree accuracy is used as the primary fitness metric, while the Firefly Algorithm refines the feature selection process. The algorithm balances exploration and exploitation by adjusting key parameters such as inertia weight, learning factors, and attraction coefficients. The Firefly Algorithm further optimizes feature selection, enhancing decision tree performance.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is essential in data mining and machine learning, significantly enhancing classification accuracy and reducing computational overhead. As datasets increase in size, identifying optimal feature subsets becomes more complex, necessitating the use of metaheuristic optimization techniques. Unlike traditional methods, these techniques effectively navigate extensive search spaces. The Snow Ablation Optimizer (SAO), a novel and widely adopted nature-inspired metaheuristic, is recognized for its simplicity and optimization efficacy. Nevertheless, SAO, like other nature-inspired algorithms, encounters limitations such as accuracy constraints, restricted population diversity, and premature convergence, particularly in complex, high-dimensional datasets. To address these limitations, this study proposes an improved variant of the recent optimization algorithm known as the Enhanced Snow Ablation Optimizer (ESAO), along with a wrapper-based feature selection (FS) method that utilizes the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier. In the initial phase, the proposed algorithm employs a position update mechanism using advanced quadratic and Newton interpolation operators to navigate complex search spaces and accelerate convergence. Taylor neighbourhood strategies broaden the search scope, enhancing exploration and solution discovery while minimizing the risk of local optima. Second-order differential perturbation strategies further improve exploration and exploitation by capturing objective function nonlinearities, ensuring more accurate and efficient optimization, and promoting diverse solutions. The SAO algorithm, originally formulated for continuous search spaces, currently employs eight transfer functions: S-shaped, V-shaped, Z-shaped, and three U-shaped, customized to address optimization challenges within binary spaces. Its efficacy was validated using 21 high-dimensional datasets and compared against eight competitor algorithms. Subsequently, the “Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” method assesses optimal transfer functions based on classification accuracy, highlighting significant progress with accuracies ranging from 88 to 100%.},

  abstract     = {Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) is complex due to their decentralized topology and dynamic environments. Conventional routing protocols frequently have trouble maintaining reliable end-to-end communication, leading to issues such as high packet loss, unstable routes, and increased delays. The research presented a novel deep-learning model with hybrid optimization to maintain route stability through stable node prediction and optimal route discovery in a MANET environment. Here Dynamic Sparse Recurrent-Convolutional Neural Network (DSR-CNN), an advanced variant of the R-CNN family is employed to detect the stable node in a sparse and dynamic environment. The weight parameters of the DSR-CNN are optimized by the Enhanced Fick’s Law Optimization Algorithm for the improved node prediction maintaining reliability and connectivity. Moreover, the most stable routes are constructed through the Giant Trevally Optimizer, optimizing route exploration and recovery. The model is designed and simulated in a Python environment with the required network settings. The utilization of the proposed research in the MANET communication shows 98% prediction accuracy, 2.48 ms delay, 25Mbps throughput, and 99% of packet delivery ratio which are more efficient than the prevailing technique’s results showing the highest route stability. These findings highlight the potential of DSR-CNN to significantly improve the reliability and performance of MANETs, setting a new benchmark for future routing protocols.},
