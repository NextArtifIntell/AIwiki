  abstract     = {We propose a framework that allows to quantitatively analyze the interplay of the different agents involved in gas trade and transport in the context of the European entry-exit system. Previous contributions have focused on the case of perfectly competitive buyers and sellers of gas, which allows to replace the respective market equilibrium problem by a single welfare maximization problem. Our novel framework considers the mathematically more challenging case of a monopolistic and thus strategic gas seller. In this framework, the objective functions of the gas sellers and buyers cannot be aggregated into a common objective function, which is why a multilevel formulation is necessary to accurately capture the sequential nature of the decisions taken. For this setup, we derive sufficient conditions that allow for reformulating the challenging four-level model as a computationally tractable single-level reformulation. We prove the correctness of this reformulation and use it for solving several test instances to illustrate the applicability of our approach.},

  abstract     = {This work presents the two-stage stochastic red-blue set covering problem (2S-SRBSC). The red-blue set covering problem (RBSC) selects a subcollection of sets to cover all the blue elements while minimizing the number of red elements covered. Although RBSC has many application areas, such as classification and fraud detection, it does not capture randomness related to set membership and color uncertainty or any sense of recourse in response to the uncertainty. This work motivates these considerations via a fraud-prevention problem mortgage lenders face in practice. 2S-SRBSC is introduced to address this. In the proposed problem, uncertainty is represented via scenarios, and the decision-maker pays for sets in the first stage and has recourse to cover blue elements in the second stage that remain uncovered post-uncertainty. Different variants of 2S-SRBSC are considered, highlighting how they can model the real-life problem mortgage lenders face. In the case of 2S-SRBSC with simple recourse, a Benders decomposition (BD) and Benders dual decomposition (BDD) are presented and implemented in a commercial branch-and-cut solver. The resulting BDD subproblems yield cuts that are significantly tighter than those BD produces. The decompositions are tested and offer improvements in terms of solution quality and time for large-scale instances relative to the extensive form. Furthermore, the BDD exhibits desirable performance for instances where the commercial solver can quickly solve the mixed-binary subproblems. This work presents the first computational experience with decomposition algorithms applied to 2S-SRBSC problems.},

In these problems, the goal (or objective) output is to be minimized, subject to one or more constraints for the other outputs and for the inputs. Our methododology combines the“Karush-Kuhn-Tucker”(KKT) conditions with“efficient global optimization”(EGO).These KKT conditions are well-known first-order necessary optimality conditions in white-box mathematical optimization, but our method is the first EGO method that uses these conditions. EGO is a popular type of algorithm that is closely related to“Bayesian optimization” and“active machine learning”, as they all use Gaussian processes or Kriging to approximate the input/output behavior of black-box models. We numerically compare the performance of our KKT-EGO algorithm and two alternative EGO algorithms, in several popular examples. In some examples our algorithm converges faster to the true optimum, so our algorithm may provide a suitable alternative.},

  abstract     = {Choosing the right system architecture for the problem at hand is challenging due to the large design space and high uncertainty in the early stage of the design process. Formulating the architecting process as an optimization problem may mitigate some of these challenges. This work investigates strategies for solving system architecture optimization (SAO) problems: expensive, black-box, hierarchical, mixed-discrete, constrained, multi-objective problems that may be subject to hidden constraints. Imputation ratio, correction ratio, correction fraction, and max rate diversity metrics are defined for characterizing hierarchical design spaces. This work considers two classes of optimization algorithms for SAO: multi-objective evolutionary algorithms such as NSGA-II, and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms. A new Gaussian process kernel is presented that enables modeling hierarchical categorical variables, extending previous work on modeling continuous and integer hierarchical variables. Next, a hierarchical sampling algorithm that uses design space hierarchy to group design vectors by active design variables is developed. Then, it is demonstrated that integrating more hierarchy information in the optimization algorithms yields better optimization results for BO algorithms. Several realistic single-objective and multi-objective test problems are used for investigations. Finally, the BO algorithm is applied to a jet engine architecture optimization problem. This work shows that the developed BO algorithm can effectively solve the problem with one order of magnitude less function evaluations than NSGA-II. The algorithms and problems used in this work are implemented in the open-source Python library SBArchOpt.},

  abstract     = {For a connected graph $$\mathcal {G}=(V,E)$$ with n nodes, m edges, and Laplacian matrix $${\varvec{ L }}$$ , a grounded Laplacian matrix $${\varvec{ L }}(S)$$ of $$\mathcal {G}$$ is a $$(n-k) \times (n-k)$$ principal submatrix of $${\varvec{ L }}$$ , obtained from $${\varvec{ L }}$$ by deleting k rows and columns corresponding to k selected nodes forming a set $$S\subseteq V$$ . The smallest eigenvalue $$\lambda (S)$$ of $${\varvec{ L }}(S)$$ plays a pivotal role in various dynamics defined on $$\mathcal {G}$$ . For example, $$\lambda (S)$$ characterizes the convergence rate of leader-follower consensus, as well as the effectiveness of a pinning scheme for the pinning control problem, with larger $$\lambda (S)$$ corresponding to smaller convergence time or better effectiveness of a pinning scheme. In this paper, we focus on the problem of optimally selecting a subset S of fixed $$k \ll n$$ nodes, in order to maximize the smallest eigenvalue $$\lambda (S)$$ of the grounded Laplacian matrix $${\varvec{ L }}(S)$$ . We show that this optimization problem is NP-hard and that the objective function is non-submodular but monotone. Due to the difficulty of obtaining the optimal solution, we first propose a naïve heuristic algorithm selecting one optimal node at each time for k iterations. Then we propose a fast heuristic scalable algorithm to solve this problem, using the derivative matrix, matrix perturbations, and Laplacian solvers as tools. Our naïve heuristic algorithm takes $$\tilde{O}(knm)$$ time, while the fast greedy heuristic has a nearly linear time complexity of $$\tilde{O}(km)$$ , where $$\tilde{O}(\cdot )$$ notation suppresses the $$\textrm{poly} (\log n)$$ factors. We also conduct numerous experiments on different networks sized up to one million nodes, demonstrating the superiority of our algorithm in terms of efficiency and effectiveness compared to baseline methods.},

By applying a special separation theorem for the nonconvex sets in reflexive Banach spaces, some necessary optimality conditions for a nonconvex (scalar/vector) function having a global minimum/and a (weakly) efficient solution concern the existence of a weakly subgradient pair are derived. Under some suitable assumptions, one of such conditions becomes the sufficient optimality condition respectively.

For this problem, it is shown that a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition at a global minimizer is necessary and sufficient for ensuring an exact relaxation with attainment of the conic programming relaxation. The exact conic programming relaxations are applied to SOS-convex polynomial programs, where appropriate choices of the data allow the associated conic programming relaxation to be reformulated as a semidefinite programming problem.

  abstract     = {This paper analyzes the convergence rate of decomposition algorithms for globally solving nonconvex stochastic programming problems. We focus on two recent algorithms, termed CZ (Cao and Zavala in J Glob Optim 75:393–416, 2019) and LG (Li and Grossmann in J Glob Optim 75:247–272, 2019), that guarantee global optimality while achieving a favorable decomposed scaling with respect to the number of scenarios. Both methods project the problem into the space of first-stage decisions and apply a spatial-B&amp;B search in this reduced space. Consequently, we observe that they are subject to the results of prior studies on the efficiency of general spatial-B&amp;B algorithms. Such studies have concluded that, to avoid very slow convergence due to the cluster problem, it is necessary (but not sufficient) for the B&amp;B lower bounding problems to have a sufficiently high Hausdorff convergence order. We apply this concept to the CZ and LG decomposition algorithms by first arguing that their lower bounding procedures can be interpreted as defining relaxations in the reduced space of first-stage decisions, and then analyzing the Hausdorff convergence of these relaxations in detail. The results are found to depend strongly on the regularity of the recourse optimal value functions. The relaxations used by CZ are found to be first-order convergent or less, while second order is generally necessary to avoid clustering. In contrast, the relaxations used by LG achieve the highest order possible within the decomposition framework we consider, which is second order when the value functions are smooth, but first order or less otherwise. Unfortunately, these functions are only guaranteed to be lower semi-continuous under standard assumptions. This alludes to a larger limitation of the projection-based decomposition approach, which is discussed at length.},
