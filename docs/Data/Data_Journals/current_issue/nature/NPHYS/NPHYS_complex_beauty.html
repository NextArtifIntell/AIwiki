  abstract     = {The fascinating hypothesis that supercooled water may segregate into two distinct liquid phases, each with unique structures and densities, was first posited in 1992. This idea, initially based on numerical analyses with the ST2 water-like empirical potential, challenged the conventional understanding of water’s phase behaviour at the time and has since intrigued the scientific community. Over the past three decades, advancements in computational modelling—particularly through the advent of data-driven many-body potentials rigorously derived from first principles and augmented by the efficiency of neural networks—have greatly enhanced the accuracy of molecular simulations, enabling the exploration of the phase behaviour of water with unprecedented realism. Our study leverages these computational advances to probe the elusive liquid–liquid transition in supercooled water. Microsecond-long simulations with chemical accuracy, conducted over several years, provide compelling evidence that water indeed exists in two discernibly distinct liquid states at low temperature and high pressure. By pinpointing a realistic estimate for the location of the liquid–liquid critical point at ~198 K and ~1,250 atm, our study not only advances the current understanding of water’s anomalous behaviour but also establishes a basis for experimental validation. Importantly, our simulations indicate that the liquid–liquid critical point falls within temperature and pressure ranges that could potentially be experimentally probed in water nanodroplets, opening up the possibility for direct measurements. A liquid–liquid transition in supercooled water has long been predicted. State-of-the-art simulations now precisely confine the temperature and pressure ranges for this transition, which are found to be within experimental reach.},

  abstract     = {Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. Here we numerically investigate a double-percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses, the so-called α and β relaxations. For several simple glass formers, we find that when monitoring the dynamic shear modulus as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the α process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass state, the mobile-particle percolation transition pinpoints a β process whenever the latter is well separated from the main (α) process. For two-dimensional systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously, and no β relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest that a general description of glassy dynamics should be based on a percolation perspective. A unified description of the dynamics of structurally disordered materials is challenging. Simulations of model systems now show that percolation theory provides a framework unifying the two most prominent relaxation processes in supercooled liquids and glasses.},

  abstract     = {Particle-like topological structures such as polar skyrmions in ferroelectrics have the potential for application in high-density information storage. Since the polar topologies arise from a complicated competitive energy balance, such non-trivial topological states are difficult to manipulate by applying non-persistent external stimuli, such as bias or strain. Thus, a flexible strategy for manipulating topological polar states is needed to realize ultrahigh-density topological devices. Here we demonstrate that thermal excitation can simultaneously regulate the competition of elastic, electrostatic, polarization gradient and Landau energies to trigger polar topological state switching. By designing the temperature evolution pathways, the individual states that are believed to be unstable or intermediate can now be switched and stabilized. Therefore, our strategy expands the diversity of polar topologies in a single superlattice system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the laser-based thermal local switching of polar solitons ranging from several hundred nanometres to a few topologies. These findings will advance the design of polar topology-based ultrahigh-density storage. Stable manipulation of polar skyrmions is challenging because of the underlying competitive energy scales. Now thermal excitation has been demonstrated to be an effective way to control such topological states.},

  abstract     = {Floquet–Bloch manipulation, achieved by driving a material periodically with a laser pulse, is a method that enables the engineering of electronic and magnetic phases in solids by effectively modifying the structure of their electronic bands. However, the application of Floquet–Bloch manipulation in topological magnetic systems, particularly those with inherent disorder, remains largely unexplored. Here we realize Floquet–Bloch manipulation of the Dirac surface-state mass of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi2Te4. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that opposite helicities of mid-infrared circularly polarized light result in substantially different Dirac mass gaps in the antiferromagnetic phase, despite the equilibrium Dirac cone being massless. We explain our findings in terms of a Dirac fermion with a random mass. Our results underscore Floquet–Bloch manipulation as a powerful tool for controlling topology, even in the presence of disorder, and for uncovering properties of materials that may elude conventional probes. Periodic laser light can modify the electronic properties of solids and offers a path to create new material phases. In a topological antiferromagnet, periodic driving with opposite light helicities is now shown to produce distinct Dirac mass gaps.},

  abstract     = {Photo-excited quantum materials can be driven into thermally inaccessible metastable states that exhibit structural, charge, spin, topological and superconducting orders. Metastable states typically emerge on timescales set by the intrinsic electronic and phononic energy scales, ranging from femtoseconds to picoseconds, and can persist for weeks. Therefore, studies have primarily focused on ultrafast or quasi-static limits, leaving the intermediate time window less explored. Here we reveal a metastable state with broken glide-plane symmetry in photo-doped Ca2RuO4 using time-resolved optical second-harmonic generation and birefringence measurements. We find that the metastable state appears long after intralayer antiferromagnetic order has melted and photo-carriers have recombined. Its properties are distinct from all known states in the equilibrium phase diagram and are consistent with intralayer ferromagnetic order. Furthermore, model Hamiltonian calculations reveal that a non-thermal trajectory to this state can be accessed via photo-doping. Our results expand the search space for out-of-equilibrium electronic matter to metastable states emerging at intermediate timescales. Searches for metastable states with properties not found in thermal equilibrium have been restricted to either ultrafast or slow timescales. A metastable state in an intermediate time window has now been identified in a photo-doped Mott insulator.},

  abstract     = {Superconductivity is a common feature of graphite allotropes, having been observed in Bernal bilayers, rhombohedral trilayers and a wide variety of angle-misaligned multilayers. Despite notable differences in the electronic structure of these systems, supporting the graphite on a WSe2 substrate has been consistently observed to expand the range of the superconductivity in terms of carrier density and temperature. Here we report the observation of two distinct superconducting states in Bernal bilayer graphene with strong proximity-induced Ising spin–orbit coupling. Our quantum oscillation measurements show that, although the normal state of the first superconducting phase is consistent with the single-particle band structure, the second emerges from a nematic normal state with broken rotational symmetry. Both superconductors are robust to in-plane magnetic fields, but neither reach fields expected for spin–valley-locked Ising superconductors. The Fermi surface geometry of the first superconducting phase suggests that the superconductivity is limited by orbital depairing arising from the imperfect layer polarization of the electron wavefunctions. Finally, an analysis of transport and thermodynamic compressibility measurements in the second superconducting phase shows that the proximity to isospin phase boundaries, observed in other rhombohedral graphene allotropes, is probably coincidental, thus constraining theories of the pairing mechanisms in these systems. Two regions of superconductivity are observed in the phase diagram of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. Spin–orbit coupling induced by the substrate and orbital moments are shown to be important in describing their properties.},

  abstract     = {Strongly interacting electronic systems often exhibit a complicated phase diagram that results from the competition between different quantum ground states. One feature of these phase diagrams is the emergence of microemulsion phases, where regions of different phases self-organize across multiple length scales. The experimental characterization of these microemulsions can pose considerable challenges, as the long-range Coulomb interaction microscopically mingles with the competing states. Here we observe the signatures of the microemulsion between an electronic Wigner crystal and an electron liquid in a MoSe2 monolayer using cryogenic reflectance and magneto-optical spectroscopy. We find that the transition into this microemulsion state is marked by anomalies in exciton reflectance, spin susceptibility and umklapp scattering, establishing it as a distinct phase of electronic matter. Competition between different possible ground states of strongly correlated electron systems can lead to the emergence of mixed states called microemulsions. Now this phenomenon is reported at the melting transition of a Wigner crystal.},

  abstract     = {The observation of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7–δ under pressure, following the suppression of a high-temperature density wave state, has attracted considerable attention. The nature of this density wave order was not clearly identified. Here we probe the magnetic response of the zero-pressure phase of La3Ni2O7–δ as hydrostatic pressure is applied, and find that the apparent single density wave transition at zero applied pressure splits into two. The comparison of our muon-spin rotation and relaxation experiments with dipole-field numerical analysis reveals the magnetic structure’s compatibility with a stripe-type arrangement of Ni moments, characterized by alternating lines of magnetic moments and non-magnetic stripes at ambient pressure. When pressure is applied, the magnetic ordering temperature increases, whereas the unidentified density wave transition temperature falls. Our findings reveal that the ground state of the La3Ni2O7–δ system is characterized by the coexistence of two distinct orders—a magnetically ordered spin density wave and a lower-temperature ordering that is most probably a charge density wave—with a notable pressure-enhanced separation between them. The density wave transition in a superconducting nickelate is shown to split when hydrostatic pressure is applied, indicating that it is composed of both a spin density wave and another form of ordered state.},

  abstract     = {Flat-band moiré graphene systems are a quintessential platform for investigating correlated phases of matter. Various interaction-driven ground states have been proposed, but despite extensive experimental effort, there has been little direct evidence that distinguishes between various phases, in particular near the charge neutrality point. Here we probe the fine details of the density of states and the effects of Coulomb interactions in alternating-twist trilayer graphene by imaging the local thermodynamic quantum oscillations with a nanoscale scanning superconducting quantum interference device. We find that the charging self-energy due to occupied electronic states is most important in explaining the high-carrier-density physics. At half-filling of the conduction flat band, we observe ferromagnetic-driven symmetry breaking, suggesting that it is the most robust mechanism in the hierarchy of phase transitions. Near charge neutrality, where exchange energy dominates over charging self-energy, we find a nematic semimetal ground state, which is theoretically favoured over gapped states in the presence of heterostrain. In this semimetallic phase, the flat-band Dirac cones migrate towards the mini-Brillouin zone centre, spontaneously breaking the threefold rotational symmetry. Our low-field local quantum oscillation technique can be used to explore the ground states of many strongly interacting van der Waals systems. Our understanding of the phase diagram of twisted graphene structures is incomplete. Now, twisted trilayer graphene is examined using a technique that locally images quantum oscillations and shows that a nematic semimetal is favoured at low density.},

  abstract     = {Resolving two or more constantly scattering identical point sources using freely propagating waves is limited by diffraction. Here we show that, by illuminating with a diffraction minimum, a given number of point scatterers can be resolved at distances of small fractions of the wavelength. Specifically, we identify an 8 nm distance, which corresponds to 1/80 of the employed 640 nm wavelength, between two constantly emitting fluorescent molecules in the focal plane of an optical microscope. We also measure 22 nm side length for a quadratic array of four molecules. Moreover, we show that the measurement precision improves with decreasing distance and with increased scatterer density. This work opens up the prospect of resolving individual scatterers in clusters that are far smaller than the wavelength. The central maximum of a diffraction pattern is commonly used to resolve point-like scatterers. Now spatial resolution far below the diffraction limit is achieved by using the scattering minima.},

  abstract     = {Reducing decoherence in quantum computers rapidly decreases the overhead needed to construct a logical qubit from physical qubits. In solid-state systems, a class of defects known as two-level systems is a major source of decoherence. Currently, superconducting qubit experiments reduce dissipation due to the two-level systems by using large device dimensions. However, this approach only provides partial protection and results in a trade-off between qubit size and dissipation. In this work, we instead engineer the interactions between a qubit and the surrounding two-level systems using phononics. We fabricate a superconducting qubit on a phononic-bandgap metamaterial that suppresses phonon emission mediated by the two-level systems. The phonon-engineered bath of two-level systems shows increased lifetime and affects the thermalization dynamics of the qubit. Within the phononic bandgap, we observe the emergence of a non-Markovian qubit behaviour. Combined with qubit miniaturization, our approach could substantially extend the qubit relaxation times. Defects known as two-level systems are a major source of noise for superconducting qubits. Adding a phononic crystal is now shown to extend the lifetime of these two-level systems, which could lead to improved qubit coherence.},

However, the practical cryogenic limitations of operating large numbers of superconducting qubits are becoming a bottleneck for further scaling. Due to the low thermal conductivity and the dense optical multiplexing capacity of telecommunications fibre, converting qubit signal processing to the optical domain using microwave-to-optics transduction would substantially relax the strain on cryogenic space and thermal budgets. Here we demonstrate optical readout of a superconducting transmon qubit through an optical fibre connected via a coaxial cable to a fully integrated piezo-optomechanical transducer. Using a demolition readout technique, we achieve a single-shot readout fidelity of 81%. Our results illustrate the benefits of piezo-optomechanical transduction for low-dissipation operation of large quantum processors. Superconducting qubits are measured using microwaves, posing constraints on its size and thermal budgets.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of superconducting quantum hardware is expected to run into substantial restrictions on scalability because error correction in a cryogenic environment has stringent input–output requirements. Classical data centres rely on fibre-optic interconnects to remove similar networking bottlenecks. In the same spirit, ultracold electro-optic links have been proposed and used to generate qubit control signals, or to replace cryogenic readout electronics. So far, these approaches have suffered from either low efficiency, low bandwidth or additional noise. Here we realize radio-over-fibre qubit readout at millikelvin temperatures. We use one device to simultaneously perform upconversion and downconversion between microwave and optical frequencies and so do not require any active or passive cryogenic microwave equipment. We demonstrate all-optical single-shot readout in a circulator-free readout scheme. Importantly, we do not observe any direct radiation impact on the qubit state, despite the absence of shielding elements. This compatibility between superconducting circuits and telecom-wavelength light is not only a prerequisite to establish modular quantum networks, but it is also relevant for multiplexed readout of superconducting photon detectors and classical superconducting logic. Microwaves are usually used to interact with superconducting qubits, but optical photons can be processed at room temperature. The electro-optical transceiver presented here allows all-optical readout of a qubit without affecting its performance.},

  abstract     = {False vacuum decay—the transition from a metastable quantum state to a true vacuum state—plays an important role in quantum field theory and non-equilibrium phenomena such as phase transitions and dynamical metastability. The non-perturbative nature of false vacuum decay and the limited experimental access to this process make it challenging to study, leaving several open questions regarding how true vacuum bubbles form, move and interact. Here we observe quantized bubble formation in real time, a key feature of false vacuum decay dynamics, using a quantum annealer with 5,564 superconducting flux qubits. We develop an effective model that captures both initial bubble creation and subsequent interactions, and remains accurate under dissipation. The annealer reveals coherent scaling laws in the driven many-body dynamics for more than 1,000 intrinsic qubit time units. This work provides a method for investigating false vacuum dynamics of large quantum systems in quantum annealers. Bubble formation is a signal of false vacuum decay, in which a system transitions from a local energy minimum to a true vacuum. Now, simulations on a quantum annealer show how interactions between bubbles drive the long-time dynamics of this process.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasensitive detection of the frequency, phase and amplitude of radiofrequency electric fields is crucial for applications in radio communication, cosmology, dark matter searches and high-fidelity qubit control. Quantum harmonic oscillator systems, especially trapped ions, offer high-sensitivity electric field sensing with nanometre spatial resolution but are typically restricted to narrow frequency ranges centred around the motional frequency of the trapped-ion oscillator or the frequency of an optical transition in the ion. Here we present a procedure that enables precise electric field detection over an expanded frequency range. Specifically, we use motional Raman transitions in a single trapped ion to achieve sensitivity across a frequency range over 800 times larger than previous approaches. We show that the method is compatible with both quantum amplification via squeezing and measurement in the Fock basis, allowing a demonstration of performance 3.4(2.0) dB below the standard quantum limit. The approach can be extended to other quantum harmonic oscillator systems, such as superconducting qubit–resonator systems. The narrow frequency response of quantum harmonic oscillators typically limits their application in radiofrequency electric field detection. Now motional Raman transitions in trapped ions are shown to enable wideband, high-precision radiofrequency field sensing.},

It was suggested that a phase transition in one dimension can occur in the presence of long-range interactions. However, an experimental realization has so far not been achieved due to the requirement to both realize interactions over sufficiently long distances and to prepare equilibrium states. Here we demonstrate a finite-energy phase transition in one dimension by implementing a long-range interacting model in a trapped-ion quantum simulator. We show that finite-energy states can be generated by time-evolving initial product states and letting them thermalize under the dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian. By preparing initial states with different energies, we study the finite-energy phase diagram of a long-range interacting quantum system. We observe a ferromagnetic equilibrium phase transition as well as a crossover from a low-energy polarized paramagnet to a high-energy unpolarized paramagnet, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our work presents a scheme for preparing finite-energy states in quantum simulation platforms, enabling access to phases at finite energy density. Long-range interactions have been predicted to enable a phase transition in one-dimensional systems. An experiment now validates this hypothesis in a trapped-ion quantum simulator by observing a finite-energy phase transition in one dimension.},

In terms of optical properties, semiconductor quantum dots are highly compelling, but their adoption as quantum nodes has been impaired by the lack of auxiliary qubits. Here we demonstrate that the dense, always-present, nuclear spin ensemble surrounding a gallium arsenide quantum dot can be used as a functional quantum register. We prepared 13,000 host nuclear spins in a single many-body dark state that acts as a logical state of the register. A second logical state is defined as a single nuclear-magnon excitation, enabling controlled quantum-state transfer between an electron spin qubit in the quantum dot and the nuclear magnonic register. Using SWAP gates, we implemented a full write–store–retrieve-read-out protocol with 68.6(4)% raw overall fidelity and a storage time of 130(16) μs, which could be extended to 20 ms or beyond using dynamical decoupling techniques. Our work establishes how many-body physics can add functionality to quantum devices, in this case transforming quantum dots into multi-qubit quantum nodes with deterministic registers. The thousands of nuclear spins surrounding gallium arsenide quantum dots can interface with electron spin qubits and photons. With quantum engineering, this nuclear spin ensemble becomes a robust register for quantum information storage.},

They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, which has been demonstrated using continuous-variable states in microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. For example, high-dimensional systems can be used to realize ‘Schrödinger cat’ states, which are superpositions of widely displaced coherent states that can be used to illustrate quantum effects at large scales. Recent proposals have suggested encoding qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, which are finite-dimensional systems that can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schrödinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of an antimony atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the symmetry of the qudit, and we constitute logical Pauli operations for qubits encoded in the Schrödinger cat states. Our work demonstrates the ability to prepare and control non-classical resource states, which is a prerequisite for applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction, using our scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform. A large nuclear spin has been successfully placed in a Schrödinger cat state, a superposition of its two most widely separated spin coherent states. This can be used as an error-correctable qubit.},

The theory of higher-order topological dynamics, which combines higher-order interactions with discrete topology and nonlinear dynamics, has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex systems, such as the brain and the climate, and to advance the development of next-generation AI algorithms. This theoretical framework, which goes beyond traditional node-centric descriptions, encodes the dynamics of a network through topological signals—variables assigned not only to nodes but also to edges, triangles and other higher-order cells. Recent findings show that topological signals lead to the emergence of distinct types of dynamical state and collective phenomena, including topological and Dirac synchronization, pattern formation and triadic percolation. These results offer insights into how topology shapes dynamics, how dynamics learns topology and how topology evolves dynamically. This Perspective primarily aims to guide physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists and network scientists through the emerging field of higher-order topological dynamics, while also outlining future research challenges. Higher-order interactions reveal new aspects of the interplay between topology and dynamics in complex systems. This Perspective describes the emerging field of higher-order topological dynamics and discusses the open research questions in the area.},
