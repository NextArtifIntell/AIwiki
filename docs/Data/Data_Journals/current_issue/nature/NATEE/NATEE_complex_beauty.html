By implementing semistructured interviews with 25 biodiversity finance key informants and three focus groups across Europe, we explore opportunities and challenges for upscaling private investment in nature. Opportunities arise from macroeconomic and regulatory changes, along with various technological and financial innovations and growing professional experience. However, persistent barriers to upscaling include the ongoing lack of highly profitable investment opportunities and the multitude of risks facing investors, including political, ecological and reputational risks influencing supply and demand of investment opportunities. Public policy plays the foundational role in creating and hindering these mechanisms. Public policy can create nature markets and investment opportunities, meanwhile agricultural subsidies and poor coordination between public funding sources undermine the supply of return-seeking investment opportunities. Investors demand derisking investments from uncertainties; in part caused by political uncertainty. These markets require profound state intervention to enable upscaling whilst achieving positive ecological outcomes; private investment will probably not upscale without major public policy change and public investment. Semistructured interviews and focus groups with experts in biodiversity finance in Europe identify opportunities and barriers to upscaling private investment in biodiversity, and emphasize that public policy is the key to enabling progression.},

  abstract     = {Forest gains and losses may have unequal effects on forest resilience, particularly given their distinct temporal dynamics. Here, we quantify the sensitivities of boreal forest resilience to forest cover gain and loss using a resilience indicator derived from the temporal autocorrelation (TAC) of the kernel normalized difference vegetation index from 2000 to 2020. Our findings unveil pronounced asymmetric sensitivities, with stronger sensitivity to forest loss (−4.26 ± 0.14 × 10−3; TAC increase per 1% forest cover loss) than to forest gain (−1.65 ± 0.12 × 10−3; TAC decrease per 1% forest cover gain). Locally, ~73% of the boreal forest exhibits negative sensitivity, indicating enhanced resilience with forest cover gain and vice versa, especially in intact forests compared to managed ones. This sensitivity is affected by various trajectories in forest cover change, stemming primarily from temporal asynchrony in the recovery rates of various ecosystem functions. The observed asymmetry underscores the importance of prioritizing forest conservation over reactive management strategies following losses, ultimately contributing to more sustainable forest management practices. Boreal forests have been experiencing both gains and losses in recent decades. Here, the authors show that boreal forest resilience is more sensitive to forest cover losses than to gains, indicating that functional declines due to forest loss outpace improvements following forest recovery.},

  abstract     = {Global agreements to reduce the extinction risk of migratory species depend critically on intersecting migratory connectivity—the linking of individuals between regions in different seasons—and spatial patterns of environmental change. Here we integrate movement data from &amp;gt;329,000 migratory birds of 112 species to develop a parameter representing exposure to global change: multispecies migratory connectivity. We then combine exposure with projected climate and land-cover changes as a measure of hazard and species conservation assessment scores as a metric of vulnerability to estimate the relative risk of migratory bird population declines across the Western Hemisphere. Multispecies migratory connectivity (exposure) is the strongest driver of risk relative to hazard and vulnerability, indicating the importance of synthesizing connectivity across species to comprehensively assess risk. Connections between breeding regions in Canada and non-breeding regions in South America are at the greatest risk, which underscores the particular susceptibility of long-distance migrants. Over half (54%) of the connections categorized as very high risk include breeding regions in the eastern United States. This three-part framework serves as an ecological risk assessment designed specifically for migratory species, providing both decision support for global biodiversity conservation and opportunities for intergovernmental collaboration to sustain migratory bird populations year-round. On the basis of data from &amp;gt;329,000 migratory birds, this study presents multispecies migratory connectivity as a parameter representing exposure to global change and shows that connections between breeding regions in Canada and non-breeding regions in South America are at greatest risk from global change.},

  abstract     = {Colonization of a novel habitat is often followed by phenotypic diversification in the wake of ecological opportunity. However, some habitats should be inherently more constraining than others if the challenges of that environment offer few evolutionary solutions. We examined this push-and-pull on macroevolutionary diversification following habitat transitions in the anglerfishes (Lophiiformes). We constructed a phylogeny with extensive sampling (1,092 loci and ~38% of species), combined with three-dimensional phenotypic data from museum specimens. We used these datasets to examine the tempo and mode of phenotypic diversification. The deep-sea pelagic anglerfishes originated from a benthic ancestor and shortly after experienced rapid lineage diversification rates. This transition incurred shifts towards larger jaws, smaller eyes and a more laterally compressed body plan. Despite these directional trends, this lineage still evolved high phenotypic disparity in body, skull and jaw shapes. In particular, bathypelagic anglerfishes show high variability in body elongation, while benthic anglerfishes are constrained around optimal shapes. Within this radiation, phenotypic evolution was concentrated among recently diverged lineages, notably those that deviated from the archetypical globose body plan. Taken together, these results demonstrate that spectacular evolutionary radiations can unfold even within environments with few ecological resources and demanding physiological challenges. Based on phylogenomic and geometric morphometric analyses of 132 anglerfish species, the authors infer a Cretaceous origin of the clade and show that bathypelagic anglerfish are undergoing rapid phenotypic diversification despite inhabiting a relatively homogeneous deep-sea habitat.},

  abstract     = {Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is highly prevalent in nature. Several hypotheses aim to explain its evolution including sexual selection, differential equilibrium and ecological niche divergence. Disentangling the causal mechanism behind the evolution of SSD is challenging, as selection arising from multiple pressures on fitness may act simultaneously to generate observed patterns. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to study the evolution of SSD across tetrapods globally. We estimate directional changes in body size evolution, and compare the number, phylogenetic position and magnitude of size changes between sexes. We find evidence that directional changes in size associated with SSD are typically more common in males—even in lineages where females are larger. However, underlying mechanisms differ among lineages—whereas SSD in amphibians becomes more male-biased with greater increases in male size and mammalian SSD becomes more female-biased with greater decreases in male size. Thus, differing mechanisms of directional body size evolution across sexes are essential to explain observed SSD patterns. A phylogenetic comparative analysis of male and female body size across tetrapods globally shows that directional change in size is usually greater in males but reveals different underlying mechanisms among lineages.},

  abstract     = {Sex chromosomes are a fundamental aspect of sex-biased biology, but the extent to which homologous X–Y gene pairs (‘the gametologs’) contribute to sex-biased phenotypes remains hotly debated. Although these genes tend to exhibit large sex differences in expression throughout the body (XX females can express both X members, and XY males can express one X and one Y member), there is conflicting evidence regarding the degree of functional divergence between the X and Y members. Here we develop and apply co-expression fingerprint analysis to characterize functional divergence between the X and Y members of 17 gametolog gene pairs across &amp;gt;40 human tissues. Gametolog pairs exhibit functional divergence between the sexes that is driven by divergence between the X versus Y members (assayed in males), and this within-pair divergence is greatest among pairs with evolutionarily distant X and Y members. These patterns reflect that X versus Y gametologs show coordinated patterns of asymmetric coupling with large sets of autosomal genes, which are enriched for functional pathways and gene sets implicated in sex-biased biology and disease. Our findings suggest that the X versus Y gametologs have diverged in function and prioritize specific gametolog pairs for future targeted experimental studies. Based on co-expression fingerprint analysis between homologous genes in the X and Y chromosomes (gametolog pairs) across &amp;gt;40 human tissues, the authors suggest that X and Y gametologs have diverged in function.},

Climate change is intensifying disturbances, posing risks to ecosystem services. To assess those risks, we develop a flexible, functional trait-based approach to quantify ecological, ecosystem service and economic impacts from disturbance regimes. Our broadly applicable approach integrates knowledge from disturbance ecology and ecosystem service valuation, and we highlight the pitfalls of using either perspective in isolation. We demonstrate our approach by quantifying impacts to timber and recreational enjoyment from extreme windstorms in a midlatitude forest. While we predict large potential losses to these services under historical and future disturbance regimes, common ecological metrics of compositional and biomass stability are inadequate for predicting these impacts. We then provide a roadmap for applying our approach across different social-ecological systems, illustrating the approach for crop pollination, flood hazard mitigation and cultural values from coral reefs—which all face intensifying disturbances. This study highlights and provides tools to address the pressing need to consider disturbances in future ecosystem service assessments. A generalizable, functional-trait-based approach for quantifying the effects of disturbances to ecosystem services and economic outcomes, including under climate change, highlights the need for incorporating disturbances in ecosystem services assessments.},

  abstract     = {Accounting for the cost of repairing the degradation of Earth’s biosphere is critical to guide conservation and sustainable development decisions. Yet the costs of repairing nature through the recovery of a continental suite of threatened species across their range have never been calculated. We estimated the cost of in situ recovery of nationally listed terrestrial and freshwater threatened species (n = 1,657) across the megadiverse continent of Australia by combining the spatially explicit costs of all strategies required to address species-specific threats. Individual species recovery required up to 12 strategies (mean 2.3), predominantly habitat retention and restoration, and the management of fire and invasive species. The estimated costs of maximizing threatened species recovery across Australia varied from AU$0–$12,626 per ha, depending on the species, threats and context of each location. The total cost of implementing all strategies to recover threatened species in their in situ habitat across Australia summed to an estimated AU$583 billion per year, with management of invasive weeds making up 81% of the total cost. This figure, at 25% of Australia’s GDP, does not represent a realistic biodiversity conservation budget, but needs to be accounted for when weighing up decisions that lead to further costly degradation of Australia’s natural heritage. An estimated AU$583 billion per year cost of in situ recovery of terrestrial and freshwater species in Australia, including through habitat restoration and retention and management of invasive species, is not an expected conservation budget, but exemplifies the severe cost of nature declines.},

Here we review NBSAPs of the 36 nations that submitted before COP-16 and assess their commitments to implementing target 2 (the 30% restoration target) and target 3 (the 30 × 30 protection target). By first breaking these targets into their constituent elements and assessing the detailed wording of each NBSAP we discover that no nation has created a plan that meets all the requirements—and overall ambitions—of these two targets. With 5 years remaining until the intended realization of the GBF, countries will need to increase both their ambition and action if the biodiversity crisis of the Earth is to be abated. Analysis of the 36 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans that were submitted to the Convention on Biological Diversity by 21 October 2024 reveal that no nation has yet created a plan that meets all elements of targets 2 and 3 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.},

  abstract     = {The outcomes of ecological invasions may depend on either characteristics of the invading species or attributes of the resident community. Here we use a combination of experiments and theory to show that the interplay between dynamics, interaction strength and diversity determine the invasion outcome in microbial communities. We find that the communities with fluctuating species abundances are more invasible and diverse than stable communities, leading to a positive diversity–invasibility relationship among communities assembled in the same environment. As predicted by theory, increasing interspecies interaction strength and species pool size leads to a decrease of invasion probability in our experiment. Our results show a positive correspondence between invasibility and survival fraction of resident species across all conditions. Communities composed of strongly interacting species can exhibit an emergent priority effect in which invader species are less likely to colonize than species in the original pool. However, if an invasion is successful, its ecological effects on the resident community are greater when interspecies interactions are strong. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the diversity–invasibility debate by showing that invasibility and invasion effect are emergent properties of interacting species, which can be predicted by simple community-level features. Predicting invasion outcomes in microbial communities is challenging. Here the authors demonstrate that these outcomes in both theoretical and experimental microbial communities can be predicted based on community dynamics, diversity and species interactions.},

  abstract     = {Understanding factors influencing community resilience to disturbance is critical for mitigating harm at various scales, including harm from medication to gut microbiota and harm from human activity to global biodiversity, yet there is a lack of data from large-scale controlled experiments. Factors expected to boost resilience include prior exposure to the same disturbance and dispersal from undisturbed patches. Here we set up an in vitro system to test the effect of disturbance pre-exposure and dispersal represented by community mixing. We performed a serial passage experiment on a 23-species bacterial model community, varying pre-exposure history and dispersal rate between three metacommunity patches subjected to different levels of disturbance by the antibiotic streptomycin. As expected, pre-exposure caused evolution of resistance, which prevented decrease in species abundance. The more abundant the pre-exposed species had been in the undisturbed community, the less the entire community changed. Pre-exposure of the most dominant species also decreased abundance change in off-target species. In the absence of pre-exposure, increasing dispersal rates caused increasing spread of the disturbance across the metacommunity. However, pre-exposure kept the metacommunity close to the undisturbed state regardless of dispersal rate. Our findings demonstrate that pre-exposure is an important modifier of ecological resilience in a metacommunity setting. Community resilience to stress is affected by factors such as pre-exposure to the same stress and intercommunity dispersal. The authors show that pre-exposing the most dominant members of a 23-species bacterial community to different levels of antibiotic stress leads to rapid evolution of resistance that improves metacommunity resilience even under high levels of dispersal.},

  abstract     = {In the temperate zone, deciduous trees exhibit clear above-ground seasonality, marked by a halt in wood growth that represents the completion of wood formation in autumn and reactivation in spring. However, the growth seasonality of below-ground woody organs, such as coarse roots, has been largely overlooked. Here we use tree monitoring data and pot experiments involving saplings to examine the late-season xylem development of stem and coarse roots with leaf phenology in four common deciduous tree species in Western Europe. Coarse-roots wood growth continued throughout the winter whereas stem wood growth halted in autumn, regardless of the tree species, experimental setting or location. Our results do not indicate a clear temperature constraint on below-ground wood growth, even during prolonged periods with soil temperatures lower than 3 °C. The continuous differentiation of xylem root cells in autumn and winter suggests that the non-growing season does not exist sensu stricto for all woody organs of angiosperm deciduous tree species of the temperate zone. Our findings hold implications for understanding tree functioning, in particular the seasonal wood formation, the environmental controls of tree growth and the carbon reserves dynamics. As wood growth in deciduous tree stems halts during winter, it has been assumed that wood growth in coarse roots follows the same pattern. This study on the growth of stem and coarse roots of four European tree species challenges the assumption of winter halt in below-ground wood growth of temperate deciduous trees.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models specializing in the generation of new data with the statistical patterns and properties of the data upon which the models were trained has profoundly influenced a range of academic disciplines, industry and public discourse. Combined with the vast amounts of diverse data now available to ecologists, from genetic sequences to remotely sensed animal tracks, generative AI presents enormous potential applications within ecology. Here we draw upon a range of fields to discuss unique potential applications in which generative AI could accelerate the field of ecology, including augmenting data-scarce datasets, extending observations of ecological patterns and increasing the accessibility of ecological data. We also highlight key challenges, risks and considerations when using generative AI within ecology, such as privacy risks, model biases and environmental effects. Ultimately, the future of generative AI in ecology lies in the development of robust interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and computer scientists. Such partnerships will be important for embedding ecological knowledge within AI, leading to more ecologically meaningful and relevant models. This will be critical for leveraging the power of generative AI to drive ecological insights into species across the globe. This Progress discusses potential applications of artificial intelligence models that generate new data and how they can be used to advance ecology research.},
