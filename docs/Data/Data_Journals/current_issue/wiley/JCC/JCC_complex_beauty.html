  abstract     = {Computational investigations of Inverted Singlet-Triplet (INVEST) emitters often rely on ADC(2) and TD-DFT excitation energies (EEs) obtained with the vertical approximation. Here, we first considered several cyclazine derivatives and examine the sensitivity of vertical EEs (VEEs) as well as singlet-triplet gaps, ΔE S1T1 gaps, to the level at which the ground state (S 0 ) structure was optimized. For cyclazine, VEEs and vertical gaps from ADC(2) or TD-DFT are spread over a narrow range (&lt; 0.064 eV) whether the S 0 structure is optimized with various DFT, CCSD, and RI-MP2 methods. However, for asymmetric cyclazines, depending on the protocol for optimizing S 0 structures, not only are VEEs spread over a substantially wider range (up to 0.75 eV) but so are vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps (up to 0.30 eV), leading to cases where, with different S 0 structures, one obtains positive vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps or significantly negative gaps. We relate this behavior to the introduction of significant asymmetry and bond-length variations in the cyclazine derivatives, formed by ligand functionalization or modification of the cyclazine core. On a more positive note, adiabatic EEs (AEEs) and adiabatic ΔE S1T1 gaps display significantly lower sensitivity (7–30× less) to the geometry optimization protocols than their vertical analogs. Crucially, for cyclazine, the M06-HF functional with 100% non-local exchange provides the closest S 0 geometry to available CCSD(T) data. We show that this effect exists also for other frameworks (e.g., azulene, pentaazaphenalene, and non-alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons) that have been considered for the INVEST property, with VEEs spread over a broader range of up to 1.19 eV and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps over a range of 0.62 eV. For INVEST emitters, it is therefore extremely important to judiciously choose the computational protocol for optimizing ground state geometries, in computing VEEs and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps.},

  abstract     = {Cytochrome c nitrite reductase (CcNiR) activates nitrite and produces ammonia. It is one of several enzymes that use a redox-active cofactor to perform its reaction. In this case, the cofactor has a heme with a lysine as the proximal ligand and a charged nearby arginine. The role of a tyrosine, which is also close, has been less clear. There are also four bis-histidine-ligated hemes involved in the electron transfers. CcNiR has been studied before, using essentially the same methods as here. However, the mechanism is very complicated, involving six reductions, and quite different results for the mechanism have been obtained here. For example, the tyrosine has here been found to be redox active in the final step when ammonia is produced. Also, the arginine has here been found to stay protonated throughout the mechanism, which is different from what was found in the previous study. The present results are in very good agreement with experimental findings and are, therefore, another case where the methodology has been shown to work very well. Previous examples include Photosystem II and Nitrogenase, normally considered to be the most important enzymes in nature for the development of life.},

  abstract     = {The band center of d orbitals ( d -band center) has been widely used as an effective descriptor for analyzing material properties. However, in high-entropy nanoalloys, the diverse atomic environments present challenges in systematically exploring all possible combinations. Due to computational resource limitations, generating a sufficient number of samples is infeasible. Consequently, the d -band center should be treated as a response variable in machine-learning models. We calculated the d -band center for individual atoms and applied supervised learning techniques to identify key factors influencing its behavior. While several factors were identified, their physical significance in predicting d -band centers remained unclear. To address this issue, we incorporated various interatomic distance terms as descriptors, along with element-based coordination numbers (ECN). The resulting model closely resembled the overlap integral of the Slater-type orbital, and the regression coefficients of the ECN exhibited sensitivity to the effective principal quantum number and nuclear charge. Understanding the physical significance of these descriptors is crucial for improving property predictions and facilitating data collection on novel materials.},

A strict conceptual distinction between cause and effect is recommended.

Given the importance of activation energies in reaction studies and modeling, ML composite models were created that effectively integrate molecular descriptors with semi-empirical and single energy density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The dataset, containing 300 randomly selected elementary gas-phase reactions, was assembled using accurate DFT (ωB97X-D3/def2-TZVP) values for activation energies E a from a database alongside semi-empirical computations. For accurate predictions, this approach required the inclusion of both physical organic and geometric/empirical descriptors in the training procedure. The best two ML models demonstrated efficient E a prediction capability, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.314 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.992 (Model 3) and (MAE) of 1.949 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.979 (Model 2) in validation tests. Notably, this performance approaches the threshold of “chemical accuracy” of 1 kcal mol −1 .

The focus is on proton affinity predictions to assess the influences of computational parameters. NEO-DFT incorporates nuclear quantum effects for protons involved in protonation processes. Using a test set of 72 molecules with experimental proton affinities as reference, we evaluated various exchange-correlation functionals, finding that B3LYP-based functionals deliver the most accurate results. Among the tested functionals, CAM-B3LYP performs the best with an MAD value of 6.2 kJ/mol with respect to experimental data. In NEO-DFT, electron-proton correlation (epc) functionals were assessed, with LDA-type epc17-2 yielding comparable results to the GGA-type epc19 functional. Compared to traditional DFT (MAD value of 31.6 kJ/mol), which treats nuclei classically, NEO-DFT provides enhanced accuracy for proton affinities when electron-proton correlation is included. Regarding basis sets, the def2-QZVP electronic basis set achieved the highest accuracy with an MAD value of 5.0 kJ/mol, though at a higher computational cost compared to def2-TZVP and def2-SVP, while nuclear basis sets showed minimal impact on proton affinity accuracy and no consistent trend. Overall, this study demonstrates NEO-DFT&#39;s efficacy in addressing nuclear quantum effects for proton affinity predictions, providing guidance on optimal parameter selection for future NEO-DFT applications.},

This work introduces the X2-PEC method, that is, the second generalization of the X1 series of ANN methods developed in our group, utilizing pair energy correction (PEC). The essence of the X2 model lies in its feature vector construction, using overlap integrals and core Hamiltonian integrals to incorporate physical and chemical information into the feature vectors to describe atomic interactions. It aims to enhance the accuracy of low-rung density functional theory (DFT) calculations, such as those from the widely used BLYP/6-31G(d) or B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) methods, to the level of top-rung DFT calculations, such as those from the highly accurate doubly hybrid XYGJ-OS/GTLarge method. Trained on the QM9 dataset, X2-PEC excels in predicting the atomization energies of isomers such as C 6 H 8 and C 4 H 4 N 2 O with varying bonding structures. The performance of the X2-PEC model on standard enthalpies of formation for datasets such as G2-HCNOF, PSH36, ALKANE28, BIGMOL20, and HEDM45, as well as a HCNOF subset of BH9 for reaction barriers, is equally commendable, demonstrating its good generalization ability and predictive accuracy, as well as its potential for further development to achieve greater accuracy. These outcomes highlight the practical significance of the X2-PEC model in elevating the results from lower-rung DFT calculations to the level of higher-rung DFT calculations through deep learning.},

The study consisted of evaluating the Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) performance of HABT, in spectroscopic terms, when interacting with the PI3K enzyme in a local nonequilibrium regime. This scenario could be considered by investigating the metastable states of HABT in this system. From this, it was possible to observe that the ESIPT performance of HABT considerably differs when comparing the solution and protein environments, where 63% have appropriate geometry in the protein environment, against 97% in the aqueous environment. Thus, from an entirely theoretical methodology, the present work provides insights when modeling biological systems and contributes significantly to a better comprehension of promising probes for cancer diagnosis.},

DFT and CASSCF calculations indicate that the tert-butylfulleride anion and the tris[1-(5-isopropyl-3,8-dimethylazulenyl)]-cyclopropenylium cation form an ion pair. This is the first study of this ion pair, although it is the building block of a salt that has already been synthesized.

Starting molecular orbitals were either localized using the Pipek-Mezey procedure or via an incomplete Cholesky decomposition of the density matrix. The Hartree-Fock solution was obtained within a VCCS iterative procedure, with the starting localized molecular orbitals used for the creation of the reference and the singly excited determinants. The same localized basis was kept in each iteration. For a series of medium-sized molecules, we have investigated the convergence behavior of the iterative procedure together with the sparsity of the single-excitation amplitude vector and the corresponding density matrix expressed in the localized basis.},

However, their physical meaning remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. It is the purpose of this work to shed new light on this issue. The main thesis developed here is that de-excitations are not a peculiarity of TDDFT but that they are a more fundamental property of the underlying wave functions reflecting how electrons are excited between partially occupied orbitals. The paraquinodimethane (pQDM) molecule is chosen as a convenient model system whose open-shell character can be modulated via twisting of its methylene groups. Using the one-electron transition density matrix as a rigorous basis for our analysis, we highlight qualitative and quantitative parallels in the way that de-excitations are reflected in multireference wave function and TDDFT computations. As a physically observable consequence, we highlight a lowering of the transition dipole moment that derives from destructive interference between the excitation and de-excitation contributions. In summary, we hope that this work will shed new light on formal and practical aspects regarding the application of TDDFT to excited-state computations, especially of diradicaloid systems.},

In 1990, a paper was published in which the physical causes for the rotational barrier in ethane, that is, the well-known finding that the potential energy in the eclipsed form is slightly higher than in the staggered form, appears as a consequence of a lowering of the nuclear-electron attraction and not as a greater electronic repulsion in the eclipsed form. Surprisingly, this finding has practically not found its way neither into the textbook literature nor into the scientific discourse. Here we will show, by a careful analysis of the components to the total energy and their dependence on the geometry of the molecule, that the kinetic energy of the electrons and the virial theorem play the decisive role. This is very similar to their role for the origin of the chemical bond.},

  abstract     = {The production rate of hydrogen from formic acid on palladium is enhanced in the presence of an Au nanorod by irradiating the system at its plasmon frequency. Taking inspiration from this, we study here the effect of the shape of the Pd cluster (from Pd(111)) on the photoinduced charge injection into the HCOO moiety and adsorbed H, which are the reaction intermediates of the dehydrogenation of formic acid, upon irradiation with a pulse with a carrier frequency equal to the plasmon resonance of a (not included) Au nanorod. We simulate the electron/hole dynamics at frozen nuclei by propagating the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the space of time-dependent density-functional-theory pseudo-eigenstates in the tight-binding approximation. We have taken into account a cluster with two layers of Pd and and atoms per layer (2L3 and 2L4, respectively) or with three layers and atoms per layer (3L3). For all the systems, a net negative charge on HCOO has been found, according to a photoinduced direct charge-transfer mechanism. For 3L3, an indirect charge-transfer mechanism, occurring after 50 fs and inducing a hole injection into HCOO, has also been found. Moreover, we also used a tailored pulse to populate the antibonding molecular orbital localized on the C-H bond for 3L3.},
