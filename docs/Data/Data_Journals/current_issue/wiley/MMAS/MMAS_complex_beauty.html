The new results generalize the previous results which assumed that the nonlinearities are continuous. For the Caputo FDEs, it is shown in this paper that the continuity assumptions on the nonlinearities used in the literature before are not sufficient for the obtained equivalences. A counterexample is provided to exhibit this. The previous equivalence results with the continuity assumptions alone in the literature have been widely used to study the existence of solutions and numerical solutions of the Caputo FDEs up to now, so according to the new results obtained in this paper, there are no guarantees that the solutions of the integral equations obtained in the literature are the solutions of the Caputo FDEs. New conditions which are stronger than continuity are provided to ensure the equivalences. Sufficient conditions for solutions of the integral equations to be solutions of the Caputo FDEs are obtained.

This reinforces the understanding of symmetry analysis and explores the application of differential geometry and physics to the analysis of selected problems.

Due to the problems, we calculate the operational matrix of derivatives, the operational matrix of the piecewise fractional derivative, and the pantograph operational matrix.

Unlike conventional methods that incorporate a single inertial step, our approach employs dual inertia to accelerate convergence while preserving stability. The proposed method combines the viscosity approximation technique with the extragradient method to guarantee strong convergence. Initially, the extragradient method is applied under a Lipschitz continuity assumption on the equilibrium bifunction. Subsequently, this condition is relaxed by adopting a self-adaptive step size strategy, allowing variable step sizes to be updated iteratively based on the current iterates information. Notably, the algorithm operates without requiring prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constants or any line search procedures. Strong convergence is established under mild condition, and its applicability to variational inequality problems is demonstrated. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing its capability to handle large-scale and complex problems efficiently while outperforming traditional single-inertia methods.},

Therefore, analyzing and establishing the corresponding mathematical model can help explore and study the propagation law of computer viruses.

The study presents a new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantine-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIQRS) computer virus propagation model with two delays. In addition, we introduce impulse control, an optimal control method, to explore the effect of the impulse period on the model. We first derive the basic reproduction number of the model. Then, the characteristic equations and eigenvalues are discussed analytically by controlling the delay parameters variation in order to analyze local stability and Hopf bifurcation for the computer virus model. Next, we add impulse control and find that it could better control the propagation of computer viruses. Firstly, we analyze the dynamical behavior of this model using the relevant theories of time delay differential equations to provide a theoretical basis for the effective elimination and control of virus propagation in computer networks. Secondly, we use Matlab to conduct numerical simulations, which verify the correctness of theoretical results. Finally, we synthesize the theoretical and experimental analysis of the present model to provide some scientific suggestions for better control of the spreading of computer viruses.},

Traditional models often fail to capture such dynamics, making TFBSE particularly important for accurately reflecting market behaviors over time. In this paper, we propose a novel compact difference scheme to solve the mixed-type TFBSE. Discretization in the time direction is accomplished using the L1 scheme. To achieve fourth-order discretization in the spatial direction, a compact difference method based on the reduced-order method is employed. The stability and convergence of the proposed scheme under the norm are established using the discrete energy method. Finally, a series of numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical results, demonstrating both the accuracy and efficiency of the method in practical applications.},

Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of the mild solution concerning the initial condition. The obtained results are proved under weaker assumptions than the Lipschitz conditions on the system parameters. We also use the Jensen, the Gronwall, and the Bihari inequalities to acquire the results. Our results generalize the work corresponding to fractional autonomous and deterministic systems.

The linear part of the equation is assumed to have a real discrete spectrum with a complete set of eigenfunctions, which are of the form sin ⁡ k ⁢ x $$ \sin kx $$ or cos ⁡ k ⁢ x , k ∈ ℕ $$ \cos kx,\kern0.3em k\in \mathbb{N} $$ . The nonlinear operator consists of arbitrary finite products and sums of the unknown function and its derivatives of arbitrary order. The equations allow for a trivial steady-state solution that becomes unstable when a control parameter exceeds a certain threshold. Unlike most of the previous research in this direction that considers specific equations, this general framework is suitable for extension in several directions such as the higher spatial dimensions and different basis vectors. Under a set of assumptions that are often valid in many interesting applications, we derive two numbers called the transition number and the critical index which completely describe the first dynamic transition. We make detailed numerical computations that reveal the properties of the transition numbers. To show the applicability of our theoretical results, we determine the first transitions of several well-known equations including the Cahn–Hilliard, thin film, Harry Dym, Kawamoto, and Rosenau–Hyman equations.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, a new mathematical framework is proposed for studying the interrelation among population growth rate, GDP, inflation rate, and unemployment rate within deterministic and stochastic frameworks. The values of the parameters of the proposed model are estimated using real data from India. The local and global uniqueness of solutions is established for the stochastic model. The deterministic model is solved by using the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector method, and Milstein&#39;s method is used for solving the stochastic model. Numerical simulations correlated quite strongly with observed data, while projections for the 2024–2030 period indicate that controlled population growth bodes well for the outlook of the economy for India, supporting economic prosperity alongside reduced inflation and better employment conditions. The findings presented in this work are correlational; therefore, to find the possible cause for this phenomenon, further research is required with detailed datasets. Comparing our model&#39;s GDP predictions with that obtained using a long short-term memory recurrent neural network model returned very high values of predictive accuracy, thus reinforcing the strength and reliability of our framework.},

  abstract     = {A Filippov system of crop-pest-natural enemy with a Holling-II type functional response function is developed based on the fear effect and threshold control strategy. The threshold control strategy is mainly a means of controlling pests and natural enemies. When the number of natural enemies is below a threshold, the natural enemies cannot achieve a controlling effect on the pest population and control is needed to suppress the outbreak. In this case, the fear of pests to natural enemies will affect the pest&#39;s survival mode, thus affecting the pest&#39;s dynamic behavior. However, the number of natural enemy population exceeds the threshold density, and there is no need to control the system. At this point, the pest&#39;s fear of natural enemies is almost zero. The dynamic behavior of the two subsystems of the model is discussed, the existence and stability of various equilibria are analyzed, and the existence of sliding and crossing regions is also investigated. In addition, it is possible that the established model has more than one pseudo-equilibrium. Therefore, the dynamic behavior of the pseudo-equilibria is analyzed, and we observe that Hopf bifurcation occurs near the pseudo-equilibria. By numerically simulating the global sliding bifurcation of the system, we discover that as the bifurcation parameters are varied, the system exhibits a series of bifurcations such as grazing bifurcation, buckling bifurcation, crossing bifurcation, and period-halving bifurcation.},

First, the distribution-order integral is approximated by the Gauss-Legendre quadrature formula, and then a second-order weighted and shifted Grünwald difference (WSGD) scheme is applied to approximate the time Riemann-Liouville derivatives. The stability and convergence analysis of the time-discrete outline are investigated by the energy approach. The spatial dimension of the model is discretized by the fourth-order local radial basis function-Hermite finite difference (RBF-HFD) method. Some numerical experiments are performed on regular and irregular computational domains to verify the ability, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed numerical procedure. The numerical simulations clearly demonstrate the high accuracy of the provided numerical process in comparison to existing procedures. Finally, it can be concluded that the presented technique is a suitable alternative to the existing numerical techniques for the distributed-order time-fractional cable equation.},

Our objective is twofold. First, we investigate the scenario where each velocity trajectory B $$ \mathfrak{B} $$ originating from Ω ‾ $$ \overline{\Omega} $$ enters the control region in a shorter time at a fixed entry time. By employing Agmon and dissipation inequalities, and Carleman estimate in the case is the gradient of a time-dependent scalar field, we establish that the control cost remains bounded for sufficiently small and large control time. Secondly, we explore the case where at least one trajectory fails to enter the control region and remains in . In this scenario, we prove that the control cost explodes exponentially when the diffusivity approaches zero and the control time is sufficiently small for general velocity.},

In this paper, we applied the PDE approach to price European continuous-installment option and consider Heston stochastic volatility model for the dynamics of the underlying asset. We proved the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for our pricing problem based on the two-dimensional finite element method. Due to the flexibility to continue or stop paying installments, installment options pricing can be modeled as an optimal stopping time problem. This problem is formulated as an equivalent free boundary problem and then as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). We wrote the resulted LCP in the form of a variational inequality and used the finite element method for the discretization. Then the resulting time-dependent LCPs are solved by using a projected successive over relaxation iteration method. Finally, we implemented our numerical method.

Soliton solutions are essential for analyzing nonlinear wave behaviors in different physical systems, and the Kaup–Newell model is also significant in this context. The model&#39;s ability to represent subpicosecond pulses makes it a significant tool for the research of nonlinear optics and plasma physics. Overall, the Kaup–Newell model is an important research domain in these areas, with ongoing efforts focused on understanding its various solutions and potential applications. A new version of the generalized exponential rational function method and -expansion function method are utilized to discover diverse soliton solutions. The generalized exponential rational function method facilitates the generation of multiple solution types, including singular, shock, singular periodic, exponential, combo trigonometric, and hyperbolic solutions in mixed forms. Thanks to -expansion function method, we obtain trigonometric, hyperbolic, and rational solutions. The modulation instability of the proposed model is examined, with numerical simulations complementing the analytical results to provide a better understanding of the solutions&#39; dynamic behavior. These results offer a foundation for future research, making the solutions effective, manageable, and reliable for tackling complex nonlinear problems. The methodologies used in this study are robust, influential, and practicable for diverse nonlinear partial differential equations; to our knowledge, for this equation, these methods of investigation have not been explored before.

  abstract     = {We present a simplified mathematical and computational model of blood flow through a chamber of a healthy human heart, with a particular description of the left ventricle. We use fixed representations of the domain and mesh, assume blood to be an incompressible Newtonian fluid, and simulate the chamber volume variation by introducing a capacitance function, which is space and time-dependent. The inclusion of this capacitance function gives rise to a model whose differential form resembles the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The numerical methodology is based on stable Galerkin mixed finite element formulations posed on velocity and pressure. Convergence studies for the two-dimensional steady-state Stokes equation with spatially-varying capacitance indicate optimal convergence orders when combining continuous biquadratic velocities with continuous bilinear pressures (Taylor–Hood elements) or discontinuous unmapped linear pressures. On the other hand, we observed loss of optimality with discontinuous linear mapped approximations for this field, as expected for the classical Stokes problem. Additional convergence studies indicate that the optimal convergence properties are preserved in the resolution of the nonlinear model, for the case of smooth solutions. Finally, we present simulations of cardiac cycles in an idealized human left ventricle in two and three dimensions. The results are meaningful given the model simplicity and open the possibility for future extensions of the proposed methodology.},

To demonstrate the results, the concept of bounded integral contractors is combined with the stochastic result and sequencing technique. In contrast to previous publications, we do not need to specify the induced inverse of the controllability operator to prove the stability results, and the relevant nonlinear function does not have to meet the Lipschitz condition. Furthermore, exponential stability results for neutral stochastic differential systems with Poisson jump have been established. Finally, an application to demonstrate the acquired results is discussed. We demonstrate the fractional Zener model for wave equation obeying the viscoelastic materials as a practical application of the system studied, which is a generalization of classical wave equation.},

We prove that solution exists and is unique, bounded, and positive, and there exists a disease-free steady state. The basic reproduction number ℛ 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ is defined, and the existence of principal eigenvalue is studied. For ℛ 0 &lt; 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ , we prove the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable, and when , the disease-free steady state is unstable. We also prove the uniform persistence of the system. Four steady states were obtained, and it was shown that the existence of each of the steady state depends on 4 threshold quantities and we used a Lyapunov approach to prove the global stability of the steady state under certain assumptions. The results are confirmed using some graphical representations.},

Firstly, based on the differential-algebraic inequality technique, the global stability criteria of the considered system are obtained to ensure the complex-valued DDANN achieves global exponential stability. Next, by designing an appropriate feedback controller, to get the desired results, we present some constraint conditions, which make the drive system and the response system achieve the global exponential synchronization. Furthermore, as an application, a complex-valued neutral-type neural network (NDNN) can be transformed into a simple complex-valued DDANN and the global exponential stability results of NDNN are also proposed. In the end of paper, two examples are given to verify the superiority/feasibility of the presented theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a computational method for solving the second-order impulsive differential equations with loadings subject to integral boundary conditions based on the Dzhumabaev parametrization method. The idea of this method involves introducing additional parameters, reducing the original problem to solving a system of linear algebraic equations. The system&#39;s coefficients and right-hand side are determined by solving Cauchy problems for ODEs and by calculating definite integrals. Four examples are provided to show the effectiveness and feasibility of the main results.},

  abstract     = {This article examines the initial-boundary value problem for a system of first-order partial differential equations. Issues of existence and uniqueness of the solution in a broad sense are considered, while taking into account both periodic and multipoint conditions. The definition of a solution in a broad sense is introduced; the initial problem is reduced to the initial-boundary value problem for ordinary differential equations. The two-point boundary value problem for ordinary differential equations systems is studied by the Dzhumabaev method (parameterization method), which allows us to move on to the equivalent multipoint boundary value problem with functional parameters. An algorithm to find an approximate solution to the problem in a broad sense has been developed.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the stability and stabilization of the fractional-order systems with mixed delays (FOSMDs), including discrete delays and distributed delays. At first, an order-dependent stability condition for FOSMDs is derived with the use of small gain theorem. Then, based on the stability condition, a robust stability condition for the uncertain FOSMDs with polytopic uncertainties is proposed. Next, with the robust stability condition and the designed state feedback controllers, a robust stabilization condition for the uncertain FOSMDs is proposed. At last, several numerical examples are put forward to manifest the effectiveness of the obtained results.},
