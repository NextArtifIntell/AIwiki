By leveraging multiscale dynamics including pores, crystallization, and intermolecular interactions, a dense hierarchical structure is created that significantly improves toughness, reaching ≈90 MJ m⁻ 3 . This hydrogel withstands temperatures from −150 to 70 °C, pressure of 12 psi, and one-month storage under ambient conditions, while maintaining a lightweight profile of 0.25 g cm⁻ 3 . Additionally, its tunable rheological properties allow for high-resolution printing of desired shapes down to 220 µm, capable of supporting loads exceeding 164 kg m⁻ 2 .

Recent studies have focused on not only the cooling capacity but also the applicability and versatility of this technology. This study introduces a daytime radiative cooler as a sheet with exceptional cooling performance. Its matrix is composed of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which are emerging organic materials suitable for radiative cooling. Furthermore, aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) is employed as a supporting dielectric particle to enhance cooling performance. An Al 2 O 3 -assisted organic composite (AOC) is created through electrospinning and hot-pressing, resulting in a bendable sheet form. The AOC sheet demonstrates a light reflectance of 97.9% across the solar spectral region (0.3–2.5 µm) and an emissivity of 95.2% within the atmospheric transparency window (ATW) of 8–13 µm. The cooling power, derived from optical properties, is calculated to be 120.1 Wm −2 . Experimental findings confirm the AOC sheet&#39;s capability to achieve 4.9 °C below ambient temperature and, when applied to a car model, to reduce the interior temperature by 12.7 °C.},

  abstract     = {Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) represents a promising approach for cancer treatment. Compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT offers increased penetration depth and higher precision. However, the practical application of SDT is constrained by the low water solubility, poor tumor specificity, and metabolic susceptibility of most sonosensitizers. Recent research has explored the use of piezoelectric materials as sonosensitizers in cancer treatment and inhibition of bacterial growth. Upon ultrasound excitation, the separation of electron–hole (e − –h + ) pairs occurs within the piezoelectric material. By improving the crystal structure of the material or incorporating other nanoparticles to prevent rapid recombination of e − –h + pairs, the piezoelectric material accumulates charges in the conduction band and valence band, achieving the redox potential of O 2 /·O 2 − . This enables the piezoelectric material to serve as a sonosensitizer, leading to the concept termed Sono-Piezo Dynamic Therapy (SPDT). This review aims to define the concept of SPDT, provide a systematic overview of the historical development of piezoelectric materials in the application of SDT, and elucidate the potential mechanisms by which piezoelectric materials act as sonosensitizers. Importantly, various piezoelectric materials will be discussed in terms of their feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages as sonosensitizers, offering new perspectives for identifying potential sonosensitizers.},

  abstract     = {The crosstalk between immunity and cancer in the regulation of tumor growth is considered a hallmark of cancer. Antitumor immunity refers to the innate and adaptive immune responses that regulate cancer development and proliferation. Tumor immune evasion represents a major hindrance to effective anticancer treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized and lipid-bilayer-enclosed particles that are secreted to the extracellular space by all cell types. They are critically involved in numerous biological functions including intercellular communication. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) can transport a variety of cargo to modulate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review provides the latest update about how tumor cells evade immune surveillance by exploiting TEVs. First, the biogenesis of EVs and the cargo-sorting machinery are discussed. Second, how tumor cells modulate immune cell differentiation, activation, and function via TEVs to evade immune surveillance is illustrated. Last but not least, the novel antitumor strategies that can reverse immune escape are summarized.},

  abstract     = {Environmental factors are linked to aging and age-related diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that enhancing body&#39;s resistance to xenobiotics might be an anti-aging strategy. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, coordinating metabolism and immune responses to adapt to stress triggered by exogenous exposure. However, the impact of activating CAR on aging remains unknown. In this study, Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ), drug-induced premature aging mice, and senescence accelerated P8 (SAMP8) mice are used as models to explore the effects of CAR activation on lifespan and healthspan, along with the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that hCAR agonist CITCO and mCAR agonist TCPOBOP prolonged the lifespan and healthspan in model organism. The longevity effects of CITCO and TCPOBOP were attenuated in CAR homozygous nhr-8/daf-12 mutant C. elegans as well as CAR −/− mice. In C. elegans , CITCO activated both anti-stress and detoxification genes, and increased the resistance to environmental adversities. Additionally, the lifespan-extending and xenobiotic resistant effects of CITCO might be related to the regulation of age-related pathways. Furthermore, CITCO improved age-related neurodegeneration in C. elegans models. Taken together, the results suggest that the longevity effects of CAR agonists may be related to the enhancement of xenobiotic resistance of animals.},

  abstract     = {Muscle atrophy occurs during natural aging and under disease conditions. Muscle cell apoptosis is considered one of the main causes of muscle atrophy, while several recent studies argued that muscle cells do not die during muscle atrophy. Here, sensor zebrafish are generated to visualize muscle cell apoptosis and the engulfment of dead muscle cells by macrophages. Using these sensor zebrafish, starvation, and natural aging-induced muscle atrophy models are established. The data showed that the diameters of muscle cells decreased in both models; however, muscle cell apoptosis is not found in the process of muscle atrophy. In starvation-induced muscle atrophy, it also showed that the number of nuclei in muscle cells remained constant, and there is no increase in the number of macrophages in muscle tissues, both of which further confirmed that muscle cells do not die. In both models, transcriptional analysis showed that the apoptosis pathway is down-regulated, and autophagy and protein degradation pathways are up-regulated. All these data indicated that although there is a great reduction of muscle mass during starvation or aging-induced muscle atrophy, muscle cells do not die by apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into muscle atrophy and can benefit the treatments for muscle atrophy-related diseases.},

  abstract     = {A fibrous flexible sensor, with its small size, minimally burdens the human body, ranking among the most user-friendly flexible sensors. However, its application is often limited by damage caused by electrode movement, as flexible sensors are typically attached to joints, which can be greatly alleviated by placing the two electrodes on the same side. Inspired by the hydrogen bonds in the double-helical structure of DNA, the double-helical electrode design is commonly found and applied in fiber-based batteries and supercapacitors into fibrous flexible sensors through coaxial wet-spinning and further treatment. The double helical sensor exhibits high strength and maintains stable operation and is prepared under over 300% strain with gauge factors (GF) of 0.9, 39.5, and 349, respectively, in its working ranges. This unique single-sided electrode structure also enabled applications such as water flow sensing. The sensor into a smart glove capable of real-time is further integrated, five-channel finger motion detection, and used a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning algorithm to achieve 98.8% accuracy in recognizing six common gestures. This study provides a novel approach to optimize the electrode distribution in fiber-based flexible sensors through an internally encapsulated double-helical structure, making a significant contribution to the field of flexible sensing.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cells cope with oxidative stress for their proliferation and metastasis by equipping antioxidant systems, among which the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) play crucial roles. However, whether PRDXs exhibit nonenzymatic functions remains unclear. Here, it is shown that the 1-cysteine PRDX (PRDX6) upregulates nicotinamide N -methyltransferase (NNMT) to promote the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells, independently of PRDX6&#39;s enzymatic activities. Mechanistically, PRDX6 interacts with NNMT to prevent its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite-motif protein 56 (TRIM56), leading to the inhibition of NNMT ubiquitination at lysine 23 and 210 and suppression of subsequent proteasomal degradation. In addition, PRDX6-mediated NNMT upregulation activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, thereby promoting the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. Notably, PRDX6 overexpression is associated with higher NNMT protein levels in human ovarian cancer tissues and is predictive of poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. Overall, the findings illustrate a critical oncogenic mechanism of the antioxidant enzyme PRDX6 in promoting ovarian cancer progression beyond its enzymatic mechanisms.},

Herein, a battery-supercapacitor composite material Na 3 V 1.95 Ni 0.05 (PO 4 ) 2 F 3 /10%NC-KOH (NVNPF/NCK) with coexistence of crystalline and amorphous phases is fabricated by loading nitrogenous carbon (NC) onto Na 3 V 1.95 Ni 0.05 (PO 4 ) 2 F 3 (NVNPF) and etching with KOH. It demonstrates high specific capacity (187.26 mAh g −1 ), ultrahigh energy density (262.16 Wh kg −1 ), and excellent cycle performance (the capacity retention is 81% at 1 C after 500 cycles). The high performance is achieved by doping Ni 2 ⁺ loading NC and etching with KOH, which generates vacancy defects, enhances structural stability, and accelerates ion-diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the fully-printed ARSIBs (F-NTP//NVNPF/NCK) with high specific capacity (60.37 mAh g −1 ), amazing energy density (72.44 Wh kg −1 ), and excellent cycle performance, are fabricated using screen-printing technique based on the NVNPF/NCK cathode and NaTi 1.7 Fe 0.3 (PO 4 ) 3 (F-NTP) anode. To the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, F-NTP//NVNPF/NCK is the highest-performing fully-printed flexible ARSIB to date. In particular, these batteries can achieve tunability in shape and size, integration, and high-throughput manufacturing.

  abstract     = {Gene duplication has allowed protein evolution toward novel functions and mechanisms. The differences between paralogous genes frequently rely on the sequence of disordered regions. For instance, in mammals, the chaperones ANP32A and ANP32B share a common evolutionary line and have some exchangeable functions based on their similar N-terminal domains. Nevertheless, their C-terminal low-complexity-acidic-regions (LCARs) display substantial sequence differences, unveiling some degree of variability between them, in agreement with their different tissue-specific expression patterns. These structural and computational results indicate that a substitution in the vicinity of the nuclear localization signal (NLS), of Pro in ANP32A for Thr in ANP32B, determines the overall compactness of the C-terminal LCAR. The different structural properties of the disordered region affect the binding mode of ANP32 members to their targets. This type of divergent binding mode is exemplified with the extra-mitochondrial cytochrome c (C c ), a well-known ANP32B partner and which now determine also binds to ANP32A; and with the RNA binding protein HuR, whose export to the cytoplasm is mediated by ANP32 proteins under stress. Therefore, differential expression patterns of ANP32A or ANP32B may affect the regulation of C c and HuR and can help to explain the distinct roles of these proteins in diseases.},

Protein arginine methyltransferases 5 (PRMT5) plays a crucial role in regulating homeostasis of various mammalian tissues. However, its function in intestinal homeostasis remains elusive. In this study, conditional knockout of Prmt5 in the mouse intestinal epithelium leads to a reduction in stem cell population, suppression of cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis within the intestinal crypts, accompanied with shortened gut length, decreased mouse body weight, and eventual animal mortality. Additionally, Prmt5 deletion or its enzymatic inhibition in intestinal organoids in vitro also shows resembling cellular phenotypes. Methylome profiling identifies 90 potential Prmt5 substrates, which are involved in RNA-related biological processes and cell division. Consistently, Prmt5 depletion in intestinal organoids leads to aberrant alternative splicing in a subset of genes related to the mitotic cell cycle. Furthermore, Prmt5 loss triggers p53-mediated apoptosis in the intestinal epithelium. Collectively, the findings uncover an indispensable role of PRMT5 in promoting cell proliferation and survival, as well as maintaining stem cells in the gut epithelium.},

Here an efficient sintering method is presented using ultralow power UV by leveraging the photocleavable ligand, o -nitrobenzyl thiol (NT), – functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The controlled removal of NT ligands upon UV irradiation enhances light absorption by reducing the filling factor of voids in the printed layer, increasing the layer temperature, and facilitating further ligand desorption. This positive feedback mechanism accelerates nanoparticle sintering at several orders of magnitude lower energy than IPL, achieving an electrical conductivity of 7.0 × 10 6 S m −1 .

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial transfer emerges as a promising therapy for the restoration of mitochondrial function in damaged cells, mainly due to its limited immunogenicity. However, isolated mitochondria rapidly lose function because they produce little energy outside cells. Therefore, this study investigates whether near infrared (NIR)-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) pre-treatment enhances mitochondrial function and stability in mitochondria-donor cells prior to transplantation. Clinical applications of NADH, an essential electron donor in the oxidative phosphorylation process, are restricted due to the limited cellular uptake of NADH. To address this, a photo-mediated method optimizes direct NADH delivery into cells and increases NADH absorption. L6 cells treated with NADH and irradiated with NIR enhanced NADH uptake, significantly improving mitochondrial energy production and function. Importantly, the improved functional characteristics of the mitochondria are maintained even after isolation from cells. Primed mitochondria, i.e., those enhanced by NIR-mediated NADH uptake (P-MT), are encapsulated in fusogenic liposomes and delivered into muscle cells with mitochondrial dysfunction. Compared to conventional mitochondria, P-MT mitochondria promote greater mitochondrial recovery and muscle regeneration. These findings suggest that NIR-mediated NADH delivery is an effective strategy for improving mitochondrial function, and has the potential to lead to novel treatments for mitochondrial disorders and muscle degeneration.},

Natural biomolecules-based CPL materials are gaining plenty of attention due to their chiral diversity and sustainability. However, it is still challenging to construct CPL materials with opposite CPL signs from a single natural biomolecule due to its inherent chirality. Here, chiral assemblies with opposite CPL signs using chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) and achiral luminescent dyes are successfully prepared. It is found that COS can serve as a chiral template to induce the ordered assembly of the dyes along the polymer chain through electrostatic attraction interaction. It is demonstrated experimentally that the structural planarity of the dye molecules is crucial for the formation of chiral co-assemblies. Interestingly, the left-handed COS-templated co-assemblies can emit CPL with opposite handedness, which is controlled by the helicity degree of the co-assemblies. This study not only deepens the understanding of the complex assembly of natural biomacromolecules but also provides new insights into the design and construction of CPL materials.},

In this study, ULM is used to observe the human microvasculature in neonatal patients undergoing treatment for life-threatening malformations forming direct connections between the cerebral arterial and venous systems. It is observed that neuroendovascular treatment of neonatal arteriovenous malformations causes remodeling and reorganization of the cerebral vasculature by also activating corticomedullary vascular connections.

The Golgi apparatus (GA) of tumor cells is a key organelle in the formation of a tumor immunosuppressive network. However, there are no studies to show whether interfering with the GA of tumor cells can reshape the immunosuppressive network to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Therefore, the tumor cell GA-targeting self-assembled peptide (NF-1) is tailored, and confirmed that NF-1 treatment can achieve an effective immunotherapy and found that tumor cell-derived GA-dependent migration inhibitory factor (MIF) mediates the formation of immunosuppressive network in breast cancer (BRCA) through multi-omics analysis, in vivo, and in vitro experiments. NF-1 treatment-induced MIF reduction can reshape the immunosuppressive network and convert a “cold” tumor into a “hot” tumor, thus enabling immunotherapy in BRCA and enhancing the ICB efficacy in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). This study presents a general strategy for interfering with tumor GA for effective immunotherapy in BRCA, COAD, and other cancers characterized by a “cold” immune microenvironment.},

  abstract     = {Halide perovskite single crystals have demonstrated enormous potential for next-generation integrated optoelectronic devices. However, there is a lack of a facile method to realize the controllable growth of large-scale, high-quality, and high-resolution perovskite single crystal arrays on diverse types of substrates, which hinders their application in practical scenarios. Here, a one-step wettability-guided blade coating approach is reported for the rapid in situ crystallization of large-scale, multicolor, and sub-100 nm perovskite single-crystal arrays in the ambient environment. By this strategy, the physical dimensions of perovskite single crystals can be precisely regulated from 90 to 260 nm, with a size variation coefficient &lt; 10% and an area of over 900 mm 2 . All three typicalhalogen perovskites for multi-color luminescence, CsPbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, I) and their mixtures (Cl/Br or Br/I systems), are appliable to this fabrication process through the demonstration of complex RGB patterns with remarkable photoluminescence properties. Moreover, various rigid substrates such as silicon oxide (SiO 2 ), silicon (Si), and glass can also be used to construct the wettability-constrast templates where perovskite crystal nucleate and grow. After that, the perovskite single-crystal arrays or complex patterns can be transferred onto flexible substrates, for instance, COC. This method combines convenient solution processing with conventional photolithography to prepare the high-resolution, large-area, and superior-quality perovskite single crystal arrays in a high-throughput manner, showing great potential in the integration of perovskite nano-optoelectronic devices and chips.},

  abstract     = {Vanadium oxides are attracted cathodes for aqueous zinc batteries owing to their high capacity. However, the limited cyclability of vanadium-based oxide cathodes, especially at low current densities, impedes their practical application. Here, it is revealed that proton insertion is responsible for the limited lifetime of vanadium oxides. Proton insertion promotes the dissolution of vanadium oxides, deteriorating electrochemical performance. Propylene carbonate (PC) is introduced into Zn(CF 3 SO 3 ) 2 electrolyte to regulate the coordination environment of water, forming PC-coordinated Zn 2+ solvation structure and [H 2 O-CF 3 SO 3 − -PC] complex. The optimized coordination environment of water weakens the adsorption energy between water molecules and vanadium oxides, inhibiting proton insertion. As a result, vanadium-based oxides cathode without proton insertion can maintain the stability of crystal structure and avoid the dissolution of V. Taking CaV 8 O 20 ·nH 2 O as cathode, Zn||CaV 8 O 20 ·nH 2 O battery without proton insertion performs enhanced cycling performance. This work not only reveals the negative effect of proton insertion on the lifetime of vanadium-based oxides cathode but also provides an effective strategy to modulate proton insertion.},

However, the weak photostability always leads to inevitable photolysis of GO during the use, storage, and application. Indirect photolysis has a significant impact on the structure of GO via causing fragmentation and degradation, while the pathway can be divided into two stages. In the early stage, photoreduction is the dominant reaction to generate porous reduction GO (PrGO). Then H 2 O 2 breaks PrGO into fragments, and eventually, the fragmented GO is converted into CO 2 by OH radicals. The generation of porous structures in early photoreduction is a crucial premise for the subsequent photodegradation, while GO flakes without porous structure cannot be broken by H 2 O 2 and OH. In this work, a deep insight into the indirect photolysis pathway and the committed step is provided, which may bring some advanced ideas for enhancing GO stability in practical application.},

In this study, succinonitrile (SN) is incorporated into a PEO composite electrolyte to fabricate an electrode-compatible electrolyte with good electrochemical performance. The SN-doped electrolyte successfully inhibits the lithium dendrite growth and facilitates the SEI layer formation, as determined by the operando nanofocus wide-angle X-ray scattering (nWAXS), meanwhile, stably cycled over 500 h in Li/SN-PEO/Li cell. Apart from the observation of lithium dendrite, the robust SEI layer formation mechanism in the first cycle is investigated in the SN-enhanced composite electrolyte by nWAXS. The inorganic electrochemical reaction products, LiF and Li 3 N, are found to initially deposit on the electrolyte side, progressively extending toward the lithium metal anode. This growth process effectively protected the metallic lithium, inhibited electron transfer, and facilitated Li⁺ transport. The study not only demonstrates a high-performance interfacial-stable lithium metal battery with composite electrolyte but also introduces a novel strategy for real-time visualizing dendrite formation and SEI growth directing at the interface area of electrolyte and metallic lithium.},

  abstract     = {Ocular injury and infection are significant causes of vision impairment and blindness globally. Effective treatment is, however, challenging due to the physical barrier of the cornea, which restricts drug penetration in the eye, as well as the presence of eye injury that necessitates continuous delivery of growth factors on the ocular surface for cornea healing. Here, we introduce a transformative wearable corneal microneedle (MN) patch designed for efficient therapy of ocular injury and infection. The MN patch comprises water-soluble tips that encapsulate antibacterial nanoparticles (NPs), along with a transformative backing layer that contains epidermal growth factor (EGF). Upon insertion into the eye, the MN tips dissolve swiftly within the cornea stroma, resulting in the release of the antimicrobial NPs to efficiently eradicate bacteria. Meanwhile, the residual backing layer undergoes rapid in situ transformation upon contact with mildly acidic fluid from infected corneal edema, converting into a contact lens that conforms to the eye&#39;s surface, which facilitates sustained release of EGF on the ocular surface over 8 h to promote corneal healing. Benefiting from these features, the designed transformative corneal MN patch demonstrates superior efficacy in treating ocular injuries and infections in vivo, offering a promising therapeutic strategy to manage eye diseases.},

Herein, a versatile nanocomposite microneedle patch (referred to as GM-Ag 2 S/Ca 32 P) is designed to simultaneously eliminate residual tumor post-surgery and promote the healing of infectious wounds. This microneedle patch effectively penetrates subcutaneous tissues, delivering therapeutic payloads to infiltrating tumor cells and bacteria. The Ag 2 S/Ca 32 P nanocomposites encapsulated within the microneedle patch decompose in the acidic microenvironment of tumors and bacterial biofilms, releasing radioactive 32 P and Ag 2 S nanodots, which enhance tumor eradication and bacteria killing through synergistic brachytherapy and photothermal therapy (PTT). Moreover, the nanocomposite microneedle patch promotes scar-free wound healing by reducing inflammation, and promoting granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, thanks to localized hyperthermia, radiation, and the swelling and biodegradation of the microneedle matrices. This microneedle patch-based postoperative adjuvant therapy offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing melanoma recurrence and infectious wound healing, with promising potential for clinical application in postsurgical management.},

Here, multi-color fluorescence microscopy is applied to track the assembly of both liposomes and mRNA simultaneously in clinical mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy. Imaging reveals that the assembly occurs in discrete steps: initially, RNA adsorbs onto the liposomes; then, the RNA-coated liposomes cluster into heterogeneous structures ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The clustering process is consistent with a Smoluchowski model with a Brownian diffusion kernel. The transition between the two steps of assembly is determined by the orientation of RNA-mediated interactions.

  abstract     = {Sound-evoked wakefulness from sleep is crucial in daily life, yet its neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is found that CaMKIIα+ neurons in the temporal association cortex (TeA) of mice are not essential for natural awakening from sleep. However, optogenetic activation of these neurons reliably induces wakefulness from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but not from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In vivo electrophysiological and calcium recordings further demonstrated that TeA neurons are monotonically tuned to sound intensity but not frequency. More importantly, it is found that the activity of CaMKIIα+ neurons in TeA can gate sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep, which is further confirmed by optogenetic manipulations. Further investigation reveals that the baseline excitability of TeA CaMKIIα+ neurons and the delta oscillations in the electroencephalogram are particularly important in regulating the evoked activity of TeA neurons. Anatomical and functional screening of downstream targets of TeA reveals that excitatory projections from TeA glutamatergic neurons to glutamatergic neurons in the basolateral/lateral amygdala are critical for modulating sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep. These findings uncover a top-down regulatory circuit that selectively governs sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep, with the TeA functioning as a key connecting cortex to subcortical regions.},

In this paper, a neural device with intrinsic perception and decision-making (NDIPD), inspired by neuronal oscillatory activity is introduced. The device utilizes alternating signals generated by coupling the human body with the power-frequency electromagnetic field as both a signal source and energy source, mimicking neuronal oscillatory activity. The peaks and valleys of the alternating signal are differentially modulated to replicate the baseline shift process in neuronal oscillatory activity. By comparing the amplitude of the peaks and valleys in the NDIPD&#39;s electrical output signal, the device achieves intrinsic perception and decision-making regarding the location of mechanical stimulation. This is accomplished using a single interface, which reduces data transmission, simplifies functionality, and eliminates the need for an external power supply. The NDIPD demonstrates a low-pressure detection limit (&lt;0.02 N), fast response time (&lt;20 ms), and exceptional stability (&gt;200 000 cycles). It shows great potential for applications such as game control, UAV navigation, and virtual vehicle driving. The innovative energy supply method and sensing mechanism are expected to open new avenues in the development of bionic neural devices.},

Recently, an innovative catalyst, composed of ruthenium single atoms (Ru 1 ) integrated with small Ru nanoclusters (Ru NC ), has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community. However, because of its complexity, this catalyst remains a topic of some debate. Here, a method is reported of precisely controlling the ratios of Ru 1 to Ru NC on a nitrogenated carbon (NC)-based porous organic framework to produce Ru/NC catalysts, by using different amounts (0, 5, 10 wt.%) of reducing agent. The Ru/NC–10 catalyst, formed with 10 wt.% reducing agent, delivered the best performance under alkaline conditions, indicating that Ru NC played a significant role in actual alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) system using the Ru/NC–10 catalyst required a significantly lower operating voltage (1.72 V) than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (1.95 V) to achieve 500 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the system can be operated at 100 mA cm −2 without notable performance decay for over 180 h. Theoretical calculations supported these experimental findings that Ru 1 contributed to the water dissociation process, while Ru NC is more actively associated with the hydrogen recombination process.},

  abstract     = {The incidence of kidney stones is increasing worldwide. However, the underlying mechanism of the process of kidney stone formation and the kidney damage caused are not well understood. Here, it is observed that Lgals3, a β-galactoside-binding protein, is significantly increased in tissues with calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones, and in both in vivo and in vitro models. Lgals3 expression is positively correlated with the deposition of CaOx crystals. Knockout of Lgals3 markedly reduces the deposition of CaOx crystal and renal fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, Lgals3 deficiency decrease the glycolytic rate and lactate production during the process of CaOx deposition and inhibited histone lactylation of H3K18la. Mechanistic studies shows that Lgals3 directly interacted with the key glycolysis protein pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and promoted its expression by modulating E3 ligase Trim21, preventing the ubiquitination of PKM2. Furthermore, H3K18 lactylation promoted CaOx crystal deposition and kidney injury in vivo and in vitro. Lgals3 deficiency inhibites the transcription, activation, and expression of FGFR4 through inhibition of H3K18la. These findings suggest that Lgals3 may play a key role in CaOx stone formation and kidney injury by interacting with PKM2 and promoting both H3K18la-mediated gene transcription and activation.},

Although β -Ga 2 O 3 has attracted extensive research interest in advanced electronics, its high-temperature and high-speed volatile memory applications in harsh environment has been largely overlooked. Herein, a high-performance hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/ β -Ga 2 O 3 heterostructure junction field-effect transistor (HJFET) is fabricated, exhibiting an off-state current as low as ≈10 fA, a high on/off current ratio of ≈10 8 , a low contact resistance of 5.6 Ω·mm, and an impressive field-effect electron mobility of 156 cm 2 （Vs） −1 . Notably, the current h-BN/ β -Ga 2 O 3 HJFET exhibits outstanding thermal reliability in the ultra-wide temperature range from 223 to 573 K, as well as long-term environmental stability in air, which confirms its inherent capability of operation in harsh environments. Moreover, the h-BN/ β -Ga 2 O 3 HJFET demonstrates successful applications for accelerator-in-memory computing fields, including dynamic random-access memory structure and neural network computations. These superior characteristics position β -Ga₂O₃-based electronics as highly promising for applications in extreme environments, with particular relevance to the automotive, aerospace, and sensor sectors.},

However, many current machine learning methods lack interpretability, making it difficult to grasp the physical mechanisms behind various phenomena, which hampers progress in related fields. This study focuses on the Poisson&#39;s ratio of a hexagonal lattice elastic network as it varies with structural deformation. By employing the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN), the transition of the network&#39;s Poisson&#39;s ratio from positive to negative as the hexagonal structural element shifts from a convex polygon to a concave polygon was accurately predicted. The KAN provides a clear mathematical framework that describes this transition, revealing the connection between the Poisson&#39;s ratio and the geometric properties of the hexagonal element, and accurately identifying the geometric parameters at which the Poisson&#39;s ratio equals zero. This work demonstrates the significant potential of the KAN network to clarify the mathematical relationships that underpin physical responses and structural behaviors.},

This study enrolled 2279 patients across 12 centers and develops a novel multi-modality model integrating longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spatial habitat radiomics, transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing for predicting pCR. By analyzing tumor subregions on multi-timepoint MRI, the model captures dynamic intra-tumoral heterogeneity during NAT. It shows superior performance over traditional radiomics, with areas under the curve of 0.863, 0.813, and 0.888 in the external validation, immunotherapy, and multi-omics cohorts, respectively. Subgroup analysis shows its robustness across varying molecular subtypes and clinical stages. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that high model scores correlate with increased immune activity, notably elevated B cell infiltration, indicating the biological basis of the imaging model. The integration of imaging and molecular data demonstrates promise in spatial habitat radiomics to monitor dynamic changes in tumor heterogeneity during NAT. In clinical practice, this study provides a noninvasive tool to accurately predict pCR, with the potential to guide treatment planning and improve breast-conserving surgery rates. Despite promising results, the model requires prospective validation to confirm its utility across diverse patient populations and clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {2D metal-chalcogenide nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibit promising photocatalysis properties due to their ultrathin morphology, high surface-to-volume ratio, and enhanced in-plane electron transport mobility. However, NPLs, especially cadmium chalcogenides, encounter challenges in CO 2 photoreduction due to insufficient solar energy utilization and fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Defect engineering offers a potential solution but often encounters difficulties maintaining structural integrity, mechanical stability, and electrical conductivity. Herein, by taking two monolayers (2ML) CdSe NPLs as a model system, selenium (Se) vacancies confined in atomic layers can enhance charge separation and conductivity. A straightforward approach to create Se vacancies in various monolayers CdSe NPLs (2, 4, and 5ML) has been developed, enabling efficient CO 2 photoreduction with a 4-fold increase in CO generation compared to their defect-free counterparts. Significantly, accounting for higher charge density and efficient carrier transport due to Se vacancies, defective 2ML CdSe NPLs (V Se -2ML CdSe) exhibit CO evolution performance up to 2557.5 µmol g − ¹ h − ¹ with no significant decay over 5 h, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of common semiconductor catalysts.

In terms of electrochemistry, this requires fast and stable kinetics for electrochemical reaction processes. Despite the great complexity of kinetics, it is clear that lithium-ion desolvation and a subsequent step of crossing through cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) are crucial to high-rate performance, in which the two key steps depend heavily on the working electrolyte formula. In this work, a customized electrolyte is developed to coordinate ion desolvation and interphase formation by introducing vinylene carbonate (VC), triphenylboroxin (TPBX), and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) but excluding ethylene carbonate (EC). Serving Ni-rich cathodes, the customized electrolyte generates a double-layered CEI, LiF-dominated inorganics inner layer, and ROCOOLi-dominated organics outer layer, which is not only stable and very efficient for lithium ion transport. Meanwhile, a -dominated solvation structure is induced and effectively decreases the desolvation energy to 29.72 kJ mol −1 , supporting fast lithium ion transport in the cathode interfacial processes. Consequently, the Ni-rich lithium-ion battery achieves a stable long cycle at a superior high rate of 10 C.},

  abstract     = {Although both Taurine Upregulated Gene 1(TUG1) and Human Antigen R (HuR) play significant regulatory roles in Cerebral Ischemic Reperfusion Injury (CIRI), their potential pro-angiogenesis mechanisms in CIRI remain unclear. Methods: Herein, the biological roles of TUG1 and HuR in angiogenesis are first confirmed. Following that, HuR-binding VEGFA mRNAs are identified via the Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP), and Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assays. Actinomycin D and polysomal assays are also employed to confirm VEGFA mRNA stability. The co-localization of TUG1 with HuR is confirmed using FISH, while the RIP and RNA pull-down assays are employed to elucidate their interplay. The direct binding between TUG1 and HuR is confirmed through the CLIP assay. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and rescue experiments are performed to further elucidate TUG1-HuR interactions. Results: While TUG1 repressed angiogenesis and aggravated CIRI, HuR exerted contrary effects. Specifically, HuR bound directly to VEGFA mRNA, a phenomenon that enhanced VEGFA mRNA stability. Conversely, TUG1 binds to HuR directly, inhibiting its nuclear translocation and promoting its ubiquitination, ultimately reducing VEGFA mRNA stability. Conclusions: It is found that TUG1 can inhibit angiogenesis in CIRI through the HuR/VEGFA mRNA axis.},

Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) receptor EP4 is essential for cardiovascular homeostasis. This study aims to investigate the roles of cardiomyocyte (CM) and cardiac fibroblast (CF) EP4 in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibrosis. By crossing the EP4 f/f mice with α-MyHC-Cre or S100A4-Cre mice, this work obtains the CM-EP4 knockout (EP4 f/f -α-MyHC Cre+ ) or CF-EP4 knockout (EP4 f/f -S100A4 Cre+ ) mice. The mice of both genders are subcutaneously injected with ISO (5 mg kg −1 day −1 ) for 7 days. Compared to the control mice, both EP4 f/f -α-MyHC Cre+ and EP4 f/f -S100A4 Cre+ mice show a significant improvement in cardiac diastolic function and fibrosis as assessed by echocardiography and histological staining, respectively. In the CMs, inhibition of EP4 suppresses ISO-induced TGF-β1 expression via blocking the cAMP/PKA pathway. In the CFs, inhibition of EP4 reversed TGF-β1-triggers production of ECM via preventing the formation of the TGF-β1/TGF-β receptor complex and blocks CF proliferation via suppressing the ERK1/2 pathway. Furthermore, double knockout of the CM- and CF-EP4 or administration of EP4 antagonist, grapiprant, markedly improves ISO-induced cardiac diastolic dysfunction and fibrosis. Collectively, this study demonstrates that both CM-EP4 and CF-EP4 contribute to β-adrenergic activation-induced cardiac fibrosis. Targeting EP4 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for cardiac fibrosis.},

Here, microcosm experiments are performed with the bacterial feeding nematode Protorhabditis to explore the potential of nematodes in regulating microbial communities and thereby soil N 2 O emissions. Removal of nematodes by defaunation resulted in increased N 2 O emissions, with the removal of Protorhabditis contributing most to this increase. Further, inoculation with Protorhabditis altered bacterial community composition and increased the relative abundance of Bacillus , and the abundance of the nosZ gene in soil. In vitro experiments indicated that Protorhabditis reinforce the reduction in N 2 O emissions by Bacillus due to suppressing competitors and producing bacteria growth stimulating substances such as betaine. The results indicate that interactions between nematodes and bacteria modify N 2 O emissions providing the perspective for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions via manipulating trophic interactions in soil.},

In this paper, light-induced localized liquid secretion is demonstrated on the scale of tens of micrometers by a liquid crystal polymer coating with an alternating homeotropic-planar alignment. The light responsiveness is achieved by the incorporation of azobenzene derivative. The localization is achieved by applying regional through-thickness electric fields to the monomeric liquid crystals before polymerization. The polymerized coating preserves both homeotropic and planar alignment. Upon actuation, the liquid can be locally secreted from the homeotropic region while suppressed in the planar area. This method allows precise control over various secretion patterns based on different pre-designed electrodes, which paves the way for the development of responsive devices in a multitude of fields, such as targeted drug delivery, tissue engineering, and microfluidic devices.},

  abstract     = {Stainless steel felt has been employed in AEMWE as a combination of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts and porous transport layers, which are not only easy to prepare but also have excellent OER activity under alkaline conditions. However, by realizing detailed electrochemical analysis and multi-scale visualization of the bubble behaviors, it is found that the combined effect of chemical and electrochemical corrosion led to the constant accumulation of metal oxides on the stainless steel fiber surface post-durability compared to the slow-growing hydroxides after initial activation. Moreover, the rougher fiber surface morphology and weaken hydrophilicity cause the adjacent bubbles are slower to detach from the electrode and are more likely to fusion. The measured diameter of bubbles leaving the electrode almost doubles, while the total number of bubbles decreases by about two-thirds, causing the increase of plug flow in the flow field and deteriorating the performance and long-term stability of AEMWE.},

Quercetin, one of the most important dietary flavonoids, is being explored as an effective therapy for obesity with its mechanism remains understudied. Here in this study, it is demonstrated that quercetin intervention significantly reverses obesity-related phenotypes through reshaping the overall structure of microbiota, especially boosting colonization of the beneficial gut commensal Akkermansia muciniphila ( A. muciniphila ). Enrichment of A. muciniphila leads to generate more indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) to upregulate the expression of 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) via fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)/ N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A)/YTHDF2 manner, thereby facilitating cholesterol converts to cholic acid (CA). CA in turn drastically suppresses lipid accumulation via activating the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in adipose tissue. This work introduces a novel therapeutic target for addressing obesity and expands upon the current limited understanding of the mediator function of m 6 A modifications in microorganism-influenced bile acid (BA) metabolism.},

However, the common pathogenicity of distinct viruses has rarely been studied. Here, it is shown that a plant-specific RAV-type transcription factor, OsRAV15, is specifically targeted by several distinct viral proteins for facilitating viral infection. OsRAV15 is found to activate jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated broad-spectrum antiviral immunity by physically associating with JA signaling essential components OsMYC2-OsJAZ complex. To facilitate viral infection, evolutionarily distinct viral proteins encoded by diverse rice viruses generally disrupt the OsRAV15-OsMYC2 complex to attenuate activation of JA signaling. Together, the results reveal a common counter-defense strategy used by different viruses to suppress the OsRAV15-OsMYC2 module that plays a vital role in fine-tuning JA-mediated antiviral defense.},

In this work, a model laser-fabricated rotating lattice Sb 2 S 3 crystal grown in stoichiometric glass is used to demonstrate fabrication of novel macroperiodic metastructures that utilize intrinsic lattice curvature superimposed with subtle crystallographic influences. The limited availability of slip systems drives the lattice curvature magnitude to vary with crystal growth direction, maximizing for lattices aligned with the predominant Burgers vector along with corresponding increases in dislocation density. Misaligned lattice orientations form smaller secondary lattice curvatures arising from misaligned Burgers vectors with further elastic contributions. Over extended crystal growth, these secondary components align the lattice to rotate about either the &lt;001&gt; or &lt;010&gt; crystal axes forming repeating metastructures of lattice orientation with periodicity 20–160 microns in length.

The experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the nanorods are welded through the facet-dependent atomic surface diffusion and rearrangement along {100} facets. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the preferred coalescence of two {100} surfaces is thermodynamically favorable.

Despite the facile design of DNA hybridization probes, their limited specificity poses challenges in clinical applications. Here, a differential reaction pathway probe (DRPP) based on a dynamic DNA reaction network is presented. DRPP leverages differences in reaction intermediate concentrations between SNV and WT groups, directing them into distinct reaction pathways. This generates a strong pulse-like signal for SNV and a weak unidirectional increase signal for wild-type (WT). Through the application of machine learning to fluorescence kinetic data analysis, the classification of SNV and WT signals is automated with an accuracy of 99.6%, significantly exceeding the 80.7% accuracy of conventional methods. Additionally, sensitivity for variant allele frequency (VAF) is enhanced down to 0.1%, representing a ten-fold improvement over conventional approaches. DRPP accurately identified D614G and N501Y SNVs in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 variants in patient swab samples with accuracy over 99% (n = 82). It determined the VAF of ovarian cancer-related mutations KRAS-G12R , NRAS-G12C , and BRAF-V600E in both tissue and blood samples (n = 77), discriminating cancer patients and healthy individuals with significant difference ( p &lt; 0.001).

This perspective examines the multifaceted biological principles that provide olfactory systems their discriminatory prowess, and how these ideas can be ported to the design of electronic noses for substantial improvements in performance across metrics such as sensitivity and ability to speciate chemical mixtures. The topics examined herein include the fluid dynamics of odorants in natural channels; specificity and kinetics of odorant interactions with olfactory receptors and mucus linings; complex signal processing that spatiotemporally encodes physicochemical properties of odorants; active sampling techniques, like biological sniffing and nose repositioning; biological priming; and molecular chaperoning. Each of these components of natural olfactory systems are systmatically investigated, as to how they have been or can be applied to electronic noses. While not all artificial sensors can employ these strategies simultaneously, integrating a subset of bioinspired principles can address issues like sensitivity, drift, and poor selectivity, offering advancements in many sectors such as environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and disease diagnostics.},

This phenomenon provides a potential basis for the development of treatment strategies for tissue damage and degeneration. This study aims to evaluate whether mitochondria isolated from osteoblasts can promote osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mitochondria from MSCs, which primarily utilize glycolysis, are compared with those from MG63 cells, which depend on oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria from both cell types are then encapsulated in cationic liposomes and transferred to MSCs, and their impact on differentiation is assessed. Mitochondria delivery from MG63 cells to MSCs grown in both two- and three-dimensional cultures results in increased expression of osteogenic markers, including Runt-related transcription factor 2, Osterix, and Osteopontin, and upregulation of genes involved in Bone morphogenetic protein 2 signaling and calcium import. This is accompanied by increased calcium influx and regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Transplantation of spheroids containing MSCs with MG63-derived mitochondria in bone defect animal models improves bone regeneration. The results suggest that delivery of MG63-derived mitochondria effectively guides MSCs toward osteogenesis, paving the way for the development of mitochondria-transplantation therapies.},

In contrast, an increase in the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition module after radiotherapy in both relapse groups is observed. Cell–cell interactions, drug-target expression analyses in malignant cells after radiation, and multiplex immunofluorescence of tumor tissue identified interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL1R1) as a potential therapeutic target.

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) resistance to chemoradiotherapy is a major factor contributing to poor treatment outcomes. This resistance markedly affects the effectiveness of surgery combined with chemoradiotherapy and leads to post-surgical tumor recurrence. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying chemoradiotherapy resistance in GBM is crucial for understanding its progression and improving therapeutic options. This study found that moesin (MSN) acts as a key promotor of chemoradiotherapy resistance in glioma stem cells (GSCs), enhancing their proliferation and stemness maintenance. Mechanistically, MSN activates the downstream PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, driving the proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) in GSCs. This process enhances the repair of DNA damage caused by radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), thereby increasing the resistance of GSCs to chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, GNE-317, a small molecule drug capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, specifically inhibits MSN and suppresses the activation of downstream PI3K/mTOR signaling. Importantly, the combination of GNE-317 with RT and TMZ exhibits a strong synergistic effect both in vivo and in vitro, achieving better efficacy compared to the traditional combination of RT and TMZ. This study not only advances understanding of the mechanisms underlying chemoradiotherapy resistance in GBM but also provides a promising new approach for enhancing treatment outcomes.},

In this study, pancreatic lesions in patients diagnosed as either type 1 AIP or type 2 AIP are examined, and these patients’ peripheral blood at single-cell level. Furthermore, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and functional assays are performed to verify the identified cell subtypes. In type 1 AIP, there is a notable increase in the amount of B cells and plasma cells, and IgG4+ plasma cells are key pathogenic cells of AIP. The differentiation path of naïve-stage B cells into IgG4+ produced plasma cells is observed, and an increased amount of T helper cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. This study also reveals that HIF-1α, an activated transcriptional factor, can directly bind to promoter site of NAMPT, promoting higher levels of visfatin production in HIF1A+ classical monocytes.

  abstract     = {The coordination of public and private goods production is essential for bacterial adaptation to environmental changes. Quorum sensing (QS) regulates this balance by mediating the trade-off between the communal benefits of “public goods,” such as siderophores and antibiotics, and the individual metabolic needs fulfilled by “private goods,” such as intracellular metabolites utilized for growth and survival. Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 harbors a LasI/LasR-type QS system, MupI/MupR, which regulates mupirocin production through signaling molecules. This study explores how QS coordinates carbon and nitrogen metabolism to optimize the production of key secondary metabolites, including 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), mupirocin, and siderophores, which serve as public goods. Loss of QS disrupts this balance by enhancing the Krebs cycle, denitrification, pyruvate anaplerosis, and ammonium assimilation, lead to halted 2,4-DAPG and mupirocin synthesis and increased siderophore production. In the absence of QS, elevated siderophore production compensates for iron acquisition, ensuring rapid cellular growth. Under nutrient-limited or high cell density conditions, MupR regulates carbon and nitrogen fluxes to sustain public goods production. These findings highlight QS as a key environmental sensor that fine-tunes resource allocation, bacterial fitness, and adaptation to ecological and nutritional conditions, suggesting the potential for QS-targeted approaches to enhance antibiotic production and agricultural sustainability.},

  abstract     = {The adult mammalian heart has limited regenerative capacity to replace lost tissue after a major injury. Forkhead box P1 (Foxp1) regulates embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart development. However, whether Foxp1 participates in postnatal-injury cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration remains unclear. This study demonstrates that Foxp1 is downregulated at border zone cardiomyocytes of both neonatal apical resection and adult myocardial infarction. Analysis of the Single-cell transcriptome database reveals reduced Foxp1 expression in the cardiomyocyte population with high regenerative capacity. Cardiomyocyte-Foxp1 loss-of-function significantly promotes, whereas cardiomyocytes-Foxp1 gain-of-function suppresses cardiomyocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, Foxp1 directly regulates ubiquitin specific peptidase 20 (USP20), a de-ubiquitinase that prevents hypoxia inducible factor 1ɑ (HIF1α) degradation. Thus, Foxp1 regulates HIF1α and downstream heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1 (Hand1) to control the cardiomyocyte proliferation via metabolic transition from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis. Finally, cardiac type troponin T2 (cTnT)-promoter-driven adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) for Hand1 induction in cardiomyocytes significantly promoted cardiac regeneration and functional recovery. These findings may provide novel molecular strategies to promote heart regeneration and therapeutic interventions for heart failure.},

  abstract     = {Doxorubicin, an anthracycline commonly used for treating cancer patients, is known for its cardiotoxic side-effects. Although dose-dependent, but susceptibility remains variable among patients, and childhood-exposure-adult-onset remains challenging. Besides topoisomerase toxicity, Doxorubicin is also toxic to the mitochondria yet the underlying late onset mechanism remains elusive. Here, it is observed that the mitochondrial copy number in PBMCs of patients treated with anthracycline chemotherapy is negatively correlated with the change in plasma BNP levels after treatment. Isogenic hiPSC-CMs are generated with high, norm, and low mitochondrial copy numbers using mitochondrial transplantation and the YFP-Parkin system. Remarkably, lower mitochondria copy number translates to lower IC 50 , suggesting increased susceptibility. Mitochondria supplementation by intramyocardial injection prevents doxorubicin induced heart failure. Mechanistically, doxorubicin treatment leads to mPTP opening and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. This mtDNA leakage event activates the cGAS-STING pathway and drives inflammation and myocardial senescence. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of Sting (Myh6-Cre/Sting flox/flox ; Sting CKO ) and over expression of mitochondrial tagged DNase1 in mice partially rescue doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. In conclusion, the work establishes a negative correlation between cardiomyocyte mitochondrial copy number and doxorubicin toxicity. Molecularly, it is demonstrated that mtDNA leakage activates cGAS-STING pathway and accelerates myocardial dysfunction. These insights offer new co-administration strategies for cancer patients.},

Although several key plasmid elements that balance mcr-1 persistence and bacterial growth are identified, the regulatory interactions between mcr-1 and host bacteria remain poorly understood. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi crRNA library, it is identified that DNA polymerase IV, dinB , is essential for controlling the fitness cost associated with mcr-1 in Escherichia coli . The absence of dinB operon enhances mcr-1 -mediated colistin resistance but simultaneously compromises bacterial growth and competitiveness. Meanwhile, dinB deficiency mitigates inflammatory response in RAW267.4 cells and enhances bacterial colonization in murine tissues. Further investigation reveals that mcr-1 actively upregulates dinB expression, with the increased reactive oxygen species induced by mcr-1 being crucial for this activation.   These findings suggest that dinB modulates mcr expression and bacterial fitness via a negative feedback regulatory mechanism. Leveraging this regulatory relationship, a Toxin-Intein is engineered under the control of dinB promoter to selectively target and kill mcr -positive E. coli both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the work uncovers a novel adaptive mechanism underlying mcr persistence and provides a precise antimicrobial strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Metastasis remains a significant challenge in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of ribonuclease T2 (RNASET2) in HCC is still uncertain, although it has been reported to have contradictory effects on some cancers. Here, it is demonstrated that RNASET2 knockout leads to significant accumulation of cholesterol, which in turn promotes MET-mediated HCC metastasis. Mechanistically, the absence of RNASET2 hinders the degradation of RNA into uridine, thereby reducing the conversion to UTP. This reduction restrains glucuronate metabolism and the expression of the related enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1, ultimately resulting in the accumulation of cholesterol due to decreased formation of glucuronidated-bile acids. The administration of cholesterol induces the migration and invasion of HCC cells through MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) activation. However, the deficiency of RNASET2-induced HCC metastasis can be reversed by blocking MET with shRNA or savolitinib. The study identifies RNASET2 as a key regulator that coordinates RNA, glucuronate, and cholesterol metabolism. Its deficiency drives HCC metastasis through cholesterol-triggered MET activation. These findings highlight the potential of targeting RNASET2 and MET in improving the prognosis of HCC.},

  abstract     = {Targeting cholesterol metabolism is a novel direction for tumor therapy. Unfortunately, the current use of statins for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Herein, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) is identified as a novel target for treating HCC and a potential alternative to statins. Twenty-three key genes in cholesterol biosynthesis are screened, and FDFT1 is identified via public databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, International Cancer Genome Consortium and Gene Expression Omnibus). Clinical samples reveal that FDFT1 is highly expressed in HCC tissues, and this phenotype is strongly associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally, FDFT1 knockdown inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells and suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo, whereas FDFT1 overexpression promotes HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, FDFT1 downregulation decreases cholesterol and bile acid levels and then increases hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) transcriptional activity. Experiments indicate that HNF4A combines with the promoter of aldolase B ( ALDOB) and promotes the ALDOB transcription and that ALDOB combines with AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) and inhibits AKT1 phosphorylation. Moreover, FDFT1 knockdown combined with AKT inhibitor (AZD5363) treatment shows remarkable therapeutic potential. FDFT1 inhibition reduces cholesterol and bile acid levels to delay HCC progression through the HNF4A/ALDOB/AKT1 axis. Thus, targeting FDFT1 may be a novel potential strategy for treating HCC.},

The prognostic significance of circMETTL6 is assessed using RNA in situ hybridization. Functional studies involving circMETTL6 overexpression are performed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations are performed using RNA-seq, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, protein degradation assay and dual-luciferase reporter assays. circMETTL6 is significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer, and its lower expression correlates with worse prognosis. Overexpression of circMETTL6 significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cell in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, circMETTL6 recruited the non-POU domain containing octamer binding protein (NONO) by binding to its Coiled-coil domain and disrupted its binding with RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A), and consequently inhibiting growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) transcription, thereby suppressing ovarian cancer progression.

Here, the non-conventional oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is genetically engineered to enhance MA production. Initially, the malonyl-CoA pathway, comprising a malonyl-CoA hydrolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is confirmed as the most efficient for MA production in Y. lipolytica . To further enhance MA production, two novel malonyl-CoA hydrolases exhibiting higher activity than the hydrolase from S. cerevisiae , are identified from Y. lipolytica and Fusarium oxysporum , respectively. The introduction of the malonyl-CoA hydrolase from F. oxysporum increases the MA titer to 6.3 g L −1 . Subsequently, advanced metabolic engineering strategies are performed to ensure a sufficient flux of the precursors acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA for MA production, resulting in a production of 13.8 g L −1 MA in shaking-flasks. Finally, by employing the fermentation conditions and feeding strategies, a maximum concentration of 63.6 g L −1 of MA is achieved at 156 h with a productivity of 0.41 g L −1 h −1 in fed-batch fermentation.

Herein, a strategy is reported for the direct visualization of VOCs sensing by mimicking human olfactory function and integrating colorimetric COF-on-MOF sensors with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted data analysis techniques. The Dye@Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework@Covalent Organic Framework (Dye@ZIF-8@COF) sensor takes advantage of the highly porous structure of MOF core and hydrophobic nature of the COF shell, enabling highly sensitive colorimetric sensing of trace number of VOCs. The Dye@ZIF-8@COF sensor exhibits exceptional sensitivity to VOCs at sub-parts per million levels and demonstrates excellent humidity resistance (under 20–90% relative humidity), showing great promise for practical applications. Importantly, AI-assisted information fusion and perceptual analysis greatly promote the accuracy of the VOCs sensing processes, enabling direct visualization and classification of seven stages of matcha drying processes with a superior accuracy of 95.74%.

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with oxidative stress and redox signaling disruption. It is recently reported that proautophagic autophagy/beclin-1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1) is a positive modulator of the NF-κB pathway that promotes intestinal inflammation. However, its effect on intestinal redox state and whether AMBRA1 is regulated by oxidative stress remain unknown. In this study, it is found that AMBRA1 functions as a pro-oxidative factor that increases oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the N-terminal F1 domain is required for AMBRA1 to competitively interact with the N-terminal domain of NRF2, thereby antagonizing the interaction between deubiquitinating protein 3 (DUB3) and NRF2, suppressing DUB3-mediated NRF2 deubiquitination, and leading to NRF2 degradation. In response to H 2 O 2 stimulation, the interaction between AMBRA1 and ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is enhanced, facilitating USP7 to deubiquitinate AMBRA1 at K83 and K86 and stabilize AMBRA1. Notably, the USP7 inhibitor, P5091, inhibits oxidative stress and colitis in vivo. Elevated AMBRA1 expression in inflamed colon tissues from ulcerative colitis patients is negatively correlated with decreased NRF2 protein levels. Overall, this study identifies AMBRA1 as a pro-oxidative factor in IECs and provides a redox-modulating therapeutic strategy for targeting USP7/AMBRA1 in IBD.},

  abstract     = {A major characteristic of ovarian cancer (OC) is its unique route of metastasis via ascites. The immune microenvironment in ascites remains understudied, leaving the mechanism of ascites-mediated abdominal metastasis obscure. Here, a single-cell transcriptomic landscape of CD45 + immune cells across multiple anatomical sites is depicted, including primary tumors, metastatic lesions, and ascites, from patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). A novel subset of perilipin 2 high (PLIN2 hi ) macrophages are identified that are enriched in ascites and positively correlated with OC progression, hence being designated as “ascites-associated macrophages (AAMs)”. AAMs are lipid-loaded with overexpression of the lipid droplet protein PLIN2. Overexpression or suppression of PLIN2 can enhance or inhibit tumor cell migration, invasion, and vascular permeability in vitro, which is also confirmed in vivo. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that PLIN2 boosts HIF1α/SPP1 signaling in macrophages, thereby exerting pro-tumor functions. Finally, a PLIN2-targeting liposome is designed to efficiently suppress ascites production and tumor metastasis. Taken together, this work provides a comprehensive characterization of the cancer-promoting function and lipid-rich property of ascites-enriched PLIN2 hi macrophages, establishes a link between lipid metabolism and hypoxia within the context of the ascites microenvironment, and elucidates the pivotal role of ascites in trans-coelomic metastasis of OC.},

  abstract     = {Textured Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ bulk ceramic membranes are fabricated via slip casting in a 0.9 T magnetic field generated by neodymium magnets. This process aligns the oxide grains with their easy-magnetization c -axis parallel to the applied magnetic field. Depending on the magnetic field&#39;s direction relative to the slip casting, grains orient either with their a , b -plane or c -axis parallel to the normal direction of the disk-shaped ceramic, thus aligning with the oxygen permeation direction. Without the magnetic field, a non-textured bulk membrane is formed. The microstructure and texture of the ceramic membranes are meticulously analyzed using advanced techniques, including X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as related methods. Evaluation of the texturing effect on the oxygen permeation performance shows that the a , b -plane textured Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ bulk membrane achieves the highest oxygen permeation fluxes between 1023–1223 K. Additionally, it demonstrates impressive CO₂ stability, maintaining effective performance for at least 140 h due to preferential oxygen transport along the a , b -plane. These characteristics make Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ an auspicious material for industrial applications as an oxygen transport membrane, outperforming more susceptible perovskite-based materials. Magnetic alignment thus proves to be an effective method for achieving membrane texturing, enabling precise regulation of oxygen transport properties.},

Amphiphilic particles have been shown to spontaneously capture aqueous droplets within their cavities upon mixing with an immiscible oil phase, where each particle templates a single droplet. Here, an amphiphilic microparticle with four discrete hydrophilic patches embedded at the inner corners of a square-shaped hydrophobic outer ring of the particle (4C particle) is fabricated. Three dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations predict droplet formation dynamics and differing equilibrium conditions depending on the patterning configuration. Experiments recapitulate equilibrium conditions, enabling tunable dropicle configurations with reproducible volumes down to ≈200 pL templated by the amphiphilic particles. The dropicle configurations depend predominantly on the size of the hydrophilic patches of the 4C particles. This validates that the modeling approach can inform the design of dropicles with varying volumes and numbers per particle, which can be harnessed in new amplified bioassays for greater sensitivity, dynamic range, and statistical confidence.},

  abstract     = {Older individuals experience increased susceptibility and mortality to bacterial infections, but the underlying etiology remains unclear. Herein, it is shown that aging-associated reduction of commensal Parabacteroides goldsteinii ( P. goldsteinii ) in both aged mice and humans critically contributes to worse outcomes of bacterial infection. The colonization of live P. goldsteinii conferred protection against aging-associated bacterial infections. Metabolomic profiling reveals a protective compound, apigenin, generated by P. goldsteinii , antagonizes bacterial clearance defects in aged mice. AMP-binding protein ( ampB ) is identified as a key gene involved in apigenin synthesis in P. goldsteinii using homologous recombination in bacteria. Mechanistically, apigenin binds directly to the potential sites on Fgr (M341 and D404), preventing its inhibitory role on Vav1 phosphorylation, and therefore promoting the activation of Cdc42/Rac1, Arp2/3 expression and subsequent actin reorganization, which contributes to the enhanced phagocytosis of macrophages to bacteria. Collectively, the findings suggest that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may impair host defense mechanisms and increase susceptibility to bacterial infections in older adults and highlight the microbiota-apigenin-Fgr axis as a possible route to ameliorate aging-associated antibacterial defects.},

  abstract     = {Innate immune activation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). The cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, involving cGAMP synthase (cGAS) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), has emerged as a key mediator of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise mechanisms through which cGAS activation influences AD progression remain poorly understood. In this study, we observed significant up-regulation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway in AD. Notably, this increase is primarily attributed to microglia, rather than non-microglial cell types. Using an inducible, microglia-specific cGAS knockout mouse model in the 5xFAD background, we demonstrated that deleting microglial cGAS at the onset of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology profoundly restricts plaque accumulation and protects mice from Aβ-induced cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, our study revealed cGAS promotes plaque-associated microglia accumulation and is essential for inflammasome activation. Moreover, we showed that restricting cGAS-mediated innate immunity is crucial for preserving inter-cellular communication in the brain and induces pleiotrophin, a neuroprotective factor. These findings offer novel insights into the specific roles of the innate immune system in AD employing a cell-type-specific approach. The conclusions provide a foundation for targeted interventions to modulate the microglial cGAS-STING signaling pathway, offering promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.},

  abstract     = {Suppressing the non-radiative loss in the organic solar cells (OSCs) through molecular design remains a significant challenge. Typically, triplet state of organic semiconductors is lower than the charge transfer (CT) state, contributing to substantial non-radiative loss via the triplet state. Herein, a set of terpolymers is prepared by introducing a simple Pt complex block into the PM6 polymer backbone. These metalated terpolymers exhibit high triplet energy ( E T1 ) and small singlet–triplet energy gap (∆ E ST ), facilitating fast intersystem crossing (ISC) process to generate triplet excitons. Consequently, the metalated terpolymers show enhanced exciton lifetime and diffusion length, and most importantly, effectively suppress the non-radiative recombination via terminal triplet loss channels. Moreover, the Pt complex modifies the molecular aggregation of the polymer, hence optimizing the morphology of the active blends. The PM6-Pt1:L8-BO devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.54% (certified as 18.32%), the highest reported for metalated terpolymers to date. The PCE is further increased to a record high 19.24% in the PM6-Pt1:PM6:L8-BO (0.8:0.2:1.2, wt/wt/wt) ternary devices.

A novel 119-amino-acid protein, NLRP12-119aa is identified, encoded by the circular RNA circNLRP12, that effectively disrupts the formation of rhabdovirus RNP complexes through two distinct mechanisms and significantly reduces their replication. NLRP12-119aa exhibits a strong affinity for the conserved 18-nucleotide sequence at the start of the leader RNA of rhabdoviruses VSV, SCRV, and RABV, outcompeting their native N protein interactions, thereby disrupting the assembly of RNP complexes and inhibiting viral replication. NLRP12-119aa exerts anti-rhabdoviral effects by directly binding to the viral N protein, leading to its destabilization and accelerated degradation, and consequently hindering the formation of the viral RNP complex. To assess the therapeutic potential of circNLRP12 against rhabdovirus infections, a zebrafish model of VSV infection is established and noted a substantial reduction in viral load after-treatment with circNLRP12, as well as the recovery of spleen&#39;s to a normalized state from its previously enlarged and hemorrhagic state. Collectively, these findings elucidate a novel dual anti-RNP assembly strategy mediated by NLRP12-119aa, offering valuable insights for further exploration and clinical management of rhabdoviral infections.},

While most work has focused on densely covered Pickering emulsions, such emulsions are known to retain stability even when the interfaces are sparsely covered with particles. Here, the formation, dynamics, and stability of poorly covered model Pickering emulsions are studied in a controlled manner by utilizing a microfluidic platform. The formed Pickering emulsions remain highly stable, over at least 12 h, even with a surface area coverage below 3%. By directly visualizing the droplet interface at various stages, the exceptional stability is attributed to the highly spatially heterogeneous distribution of adsorbed particles which exclusively form particle bridges at the contact point between the droplets. Remarkably, these bridges are assembled in the form of crowns between the droplet interfaces, as visualized by confocal microscopy. The assembly behavior of the adsorbed particles in response to hydrodynamic forces and the formation of non-uniform particle distribution are discussed by analyzing the different forces present during emulsification, corroborated by numerical simulations. In conclusion, using a lab-on-a-chip approach, this work provides further understanding toward the fabrication of Pickering emulsions via preferential interfacial localization of particles.},

  abstract     = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a prevalent bone marrow disorder. The challenges in managing MM include selecting chemotherapy regimens that effectively modulate the myeloma microenvironment and delivering them to the bone marrow with high efficacy and minimal toxicity. Herein, a novel bone marrow targeting strategy using c(RGDfk) peptide-modified liposomes loaded with chemotherapeutics is developed, which can specifically recognize and hitchhike neutrophils following systemic administration, capitalizing on their natural aging process to facilitate precise drug delivery to the bone marrow, thus minimizing off-target effects. On the one hand, c(RGDfk)-functionalized liposomes containing carfilzomib (CRLPs) successfully transformed macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype, enhancing immunotherapeutic responses. On the other hand, c(RGDfk)-functionalized liposomes encapsulating BMS-202 (BRLPs), a small molecule checkpoint inhibitor, interrupted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and promoted the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. The co-administration of CRLPs and BRLPs successfully delivered drugs to bone marrow, leading to significant modulation of the myeloma microenvironment, reduced tumor growth, and improved survival time of MM-bearing mouse models. These findings introduced an alternative approach to modulating the myeloma microenvironment and underscored the efficacy of hitchhiking neutrophils for bone marrow drug delivery. This strategy show advantages over traditional drug delivery methods in terms of improved efficacy and lowered toxicity.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is a promising anti-tumor therapeutic strategy; however, its efficacy in solid tumors is limited. Chromosome missegregation is common in various solid tumors; however, its role in tumor progression remains poorly understood, and its correlation with ICI is yet to be explored. Here, it is found that increased chromosome missegregation promotes tumor immune microenvironment, and eventually immunotherapeutic efficacy, by triggering pyroptosis. yin yang 2 (YY2) is identified as a mitotic checkpoint regulator, which promotes chromosome missegregation by upregulating BUB1B transcription. Increased chromosome missegregation promoted the formation of micronuclei and release of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into the cytosol, triggering an AIM2-mediated cytosolic dsDNA response. The subsequent pyroptosis strengthened the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing immunoinfiltration and cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells, while preventing their exhaustion. Finally, through in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that combining YY2 overexpression-induced chromosome missegregation/cytosolic dsDNA response and PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced the efficacy of ICI immunotherapy in microsatellite instable and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer cells. Together, these findings provide new insights on the role of chromosome missegregation in triggering cytosolic dsDNA response-mediated pyroptosis and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, suggesting a novel strategy for improving ICI therapeutic efficacy in colorectal cancer.},

  abstract     = {Acute severe autoimmune hepatitis (AS-AIH) is characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis, with a current lack of effective targeted treatments. Stem cell therapy has demonstrated significant therapeutic promise across various autoimmune diseases. However, the intricate pathogenesis of AS-AIH has hindered the widespread utilization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in this domain. Herein, it is demonstrated that necroptosis, as the primary mode of cell death in AIH, is crucial in causing AS-AIH. Inflammatory macrophages are the primary cell population involved in necroptosis. Inhibition of the specificity protein 1/sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine-1-phosphate (SP1/SK1/S1P) axis is responsible for this phenomenon, leading to excessive activation of the intrahepatic immune system and aggravating liver damage. Furthermore, the S1P/S1PR2/YAP axis is the key pathway in initiating liver regeneration during AS-AIH. S1P synthesized by hepatocytes is the primary source, and this process is also regulated by the SP1/SK1 axis. MSCs promote S1P synthesis by macrophages through the delivery of SP1, which inhibits necroptosis and synergistically enhances liver regeneration. In addition, MSCs also promote S1P synthesis in hepatocytes through the same mechanism, further aiding liver regeneration. These findings unveil the core pathogenesis of AS-AIH and provide a theoretical foundation for using MSCs as a potential targeted therapeutic modality.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly resistant to ferroptosis, which hinders the application of anti-ferroptosis therapy. Through drug screening, it is found that histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) significantly sensitized CRC to ferroptosis. The combination of HDACi and ferroptosis inducers synergically suppresses CRC growth both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, HDACi reduces ferroptosis suppressor protein (FSP1) by promoting its mRNA degradation. Specifically, it is confirmed that HDACi specifically targets HDAC1 and promotes the H3K27ac modification of fat mass- and obesity-associated gene (FTO) and AlkB Homolog 5, RNA Demethylase (ALKBH5), which results in significant activation of FTO and ALKBH5. The activation of FTO and ALKBH5 reduces N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification on FSP1 mRNA, leading to its degradation. Crucially, lactylation of HDAC1 K412 is essential for ferroptosis regulation. Both Vorinostat (SAHA) and Trichostatin A (TSA) notably diminish HDAC1 K412 lactylation in comparison to other HDAC1 inhibitors, exhibiting a consistent trend of increasing susceptibility to ferroptosis. In conclusion, the research reveals that HDACi decreases HDAC1 K412 lactylation to sensitize CRC to ferroptosis and that the combination of HDACi and ferroptosis inducers can be a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC.},

However, there is a need to develop multiplexed assays capable of analyzing multiple genes simultaneously to expand its application. To address this, a multiplexed RT-qPCR using a double emulsion (DE)-based carrier and a polymer microparticle reactor, termed primer-incorporated network tailored with Taqman probe (TaqPIN) is developed. The DE securely stores nucleic acid reagents like primers and probes within the polymer network until heating releases them for the reaction. The TaqPIN RT-qPCR demonstrates an amplification efficiency of 93.8% and can detect as few as 20 copies/µL. By loading the multiple microparticles into a single reaction, a multiplexed assay with only one optical channel is enabled. In practice, a nine-plex assay is designed to distinguish between variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Even subtle variations of a single nucleotide can be simultaneously detected. Testing on 75 nasopharyngeal swab samples yields 100% sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection and 94% accuracy in variant discrimination.},

  abstract     = {The immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic cancer, characterized by low tumor-specific T cells and excessive fibrosis, limits the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Here, three datasets and multi-immunofluorescence staining of tissue microarrays in pancreatic cancer indicate that mesothelin (MSLN) expression negatively correlates with cytotoxic T cells in tumor. Anti-MSLN antibody ( α MSLN) treatment of pancreatic cancer in vivo can significantly increase T cell infiltration. Meanwhile, the combination of α MSLN and neoantigen peptide vaccine identified from pancreatic cancer cell lines is demonstrated to be more effective in inducing neoantigen-specific T cell generation and infiltration at subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models for enhancing antitumor efficacy. Single-cell transcriptome analysis shows that the combined treatment significantly reduces the proportion of fibroblasts, improves the infiltration of IFN- γ + CD4 + and GZMK + CD8 + T cells, as well as reduces the interaction of antigen presentation-associated ligands and receptors between antigen-presenting Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (apCAFs) and naive CD4 + T cells. The negative correlations between apCAFs and CD8 + T cells/IFN- γ + CD4 + T cells are further confirmed in human pancreatic cancer tissues. Overall, this study demonstrates that targeting MSLN can improve neoantigen vaccine induced immune efficacy by reducing apCAFs to interrupt the conversion of naive CD4 + T cells to Tregs, and therefore increase the infiltration of tumor-specific T cells.},

A sequence-enhanced parallel convolutional neural network is developed and generated a dataset through finite element simulations. This DL model enables high-precision prediction of hydrogel deformation. Furthermore, a progressive evolutionary algorithm (PEA) is proposed by integrating the DL model to construct a DL-PEA framework. This framework supports rapid reverse engineering of the desired shape, and the average design time for specified target shapes is reduced to ≈3.04 s. The present findings illustrate how 4D printing of optimized hydrogel designs can effectively transform in response to environmental stimuli.

This study proposes the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating CRISPR RNAs as an in vivo screening tool for ICPs in a syngeneic model of mesenchymal GSCs. Using PD-L1 and CD47 to validate the proof of concept, intratumoral administration of LNPs in orthotopic tumors achieved efficient editing of ICPs, leading to enhanced immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. Targeting CD47 reduced tumor growth, suggesting improved cancer cell sensitization to the immune system post-ICP editing. The study positions LNPs as a robust tool for in vivo validation of ICPs as therapeutic targets in clinically relevant GBM models.

  abstract     = {Re-epithelialization constitutes a critical stage in the intricate process of wound healing, yet its mechanisms in the context of diabetic wounds remain elusive. In this study, the role of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) vis-à-vis the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of keratinocytes in diabetic wound re-epithelialization is investigated. The findings reveal an impediment in the MET process, rather than EMT, which significantly compromised re-epithelialization in diabetic wounds. Furthermore, Desmoplakin ( DSP ) gene expression, encoding a key desmosome protein, is down-regulated in diabetic rats. This down-regulation coincided with aberrant hypo-demethylation of the DSP promoter. The inhibition of DSP expression is linked to reduced occupancy of Ten-eleven translocation 3 (TET3) at the DSP promoter, consequently suppressing TET3-dependent DNA demethylation. Additionally, a novel lncRNA termed DSP-AS1is identified, which is antisense to DSP . Notably, DSP-AS1 expression is down-regulated in diabetic skin wounds, and it interacted with TET3, a DNA demethylase. Notably, DSP-AS1 is found to form R-loops, triple-stranded DNA:RNA hybrids, at the DSP promoter, facilitating TET3 localization to the DSP promoter. Collectively, the findings suggest that reduced R-loop formation by DSP-AS1 impairs DSP gene transcription by repressing TET3-mediated DNA demethylation. This disruption of the orchestrated re-epithelialization process contributes to refractory diabetic wound healing.},

In drug screening, the framework illustrates the inhibitory effects of memantine on endogenous channels, and antagonistic interactions among potassium, magnesium, and calcium ion channels. For nanomatrix-induced differentiation, the classifier indicates the effects of differentiation conditions on sodium and potassium channels associated with action potentials, validating the functional properties of differentiated neurons for Parkinson&#39;s disease treatment.

Unraveling the major regulatory programs underlying MP patterned malignancy offers opportunities to identify more feasible therapeutic targets for patients with MP LUAD. This study shows that patients with MP subtype LUAD have aberrant activation of the MYC pathway compared to patients with other subtypes. In vitro and xenograft mouse model studies reveal that MP pattern in malignancy cannot be solely due to aberrant MYC expression but requires the involvement of M2-like macrophages. Excessively expressed MYC leads to the accumulation of M2-like macrophages from the bone marrow, which secretes TGFβ, to induce the expression of FOSL2 in tumor cells, thereby remodeling chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of MP-pattern genes to promote the MYC-mediated de novo transcriptional regulation of these genes. Additionally, the MP-pattern in malignancy can be effectively alleviated by disrupting the TGFβ-FOSL2 axis. These findings reveal new functions for the M2-like macrophage-TGFβ-FOSL2 axis in MYC-overexpressing MP-subtype LUAD, identifying targetable vulnerabilities in this pathway.},

Here, it is reported that motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1 (MNX1), a homeobox domain-containing transcription factor, contributes to the tumor immune escape. MNX1 increases PD-L1 expression in cancer cells by stabilizing PD-L1 mRNA rather than activating transcription. Mechanistically, MNX1 exists in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and interacts with Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), a multifunctional DNA/RNA-binding protein, to enhance the binding of YBX1 to PD-L1 mRNA. MNX1 ablation activates cytotoxic T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and sensitizes CTLA-4 blockade therapy. Moreover, MNX1 also facilitates tumor progression in an immune-independent manner in cancer cells. In addition, MNX1 is upregulated by its adjacent long non-coding RNA MNX1-AS1 via HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (HERC2). Together, these results reveal MNX1 as a novel immune checkpoint regulator with promising therapeutic potential.},
