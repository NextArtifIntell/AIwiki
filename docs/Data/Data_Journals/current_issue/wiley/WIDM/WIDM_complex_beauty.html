  abstract     = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues expanding its footprint across various sectors, robust security systems to mitigate associated risks are more critical than ever. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are fundamental in safeguarding IoT infrastructures against malicious activities. This systematic review aims to guide future research by addressing six pivotal research questions that underscore the development of advanced IDS tailored for IoT environments. Specifically, the review concentrates on applying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies to enhance IDS capabilities. It explores various feature selection methodologies aimed at developing lightweight IDS solutions that are both effective and efficient for IoT scenarios. Additionally, the review assesses different datasets and balancing techniques, which are crucial for training IDS models to perform accurately and reliably. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature, this review highlights significant trends, identifies current research gaps, and suggests future studies to optimize IDS frameworks for the ever-evolving IoT landscape.},

  abstract     = {The integration of wavelet transformation and artificial intelligence techniques has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare applications. Wavelet analysis enables multi-scale signal decomposition and feature extraction that, when combined with machine and deep learning approaches, enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical data analysis. This systematic review synthesizes 112 relevant studies from 2013 to 2023 exploring wavelet-based artificial intelligence in healthcare. Our analysis reveals that the discrete wavelet transform dominates (43% of studies), primarily used for feature extraction from biosignals (82%) and medical images. Major applications include cardiac abnormality detection (29%), neurological disorder diagnosis (27%), and mental health assessment (16%), with classification accuracies frequently exceeding 95%. Key findings indicate a shift from traditional machine learning to deep learning approaches after 2020, with emerging trends in hybrid architectures. The review identifies critical challenges in computational efficiency, optimal wavelet selection, and clinical validation. Future developments should focus on real-time processing optimization, interpretable deep learning models, multi-modal data fusion, and validation on larger clinical datasets, advancing the translation of these systems into practical clinical tools.},
