  abstract     = {The deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) panel systems, as renewable energy sources, has seen a rise recently. Consequently, it is imperative to implement efficient methods for the accurate detection and diagnosis of PV system faults to prevent unexpected power disruptions. This paper introduces a potential strategy for fault identification and classification through the utilization of machine learning (ML) techniques. The study aimed to use ML algorithms to identify and classify normal operations, seven different types of faults, in two operational modes (maximum power point tracking and intermediate power point tracking). Four machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods (decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting) were employed, followed by hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to determine the best configuration. The results indicated that ensemble methods, particularly XGBoost, excelled in detecting and classifying faults in PV systems, achieving a 99% accuracy rate after hyperparameter adjustments. The TPR values show a high sensitivity of 0.999, with some achieving a perfect score of 1.000. The FPR shows very low values, with the majority of metrics indicating FPRs at or close to 0%. This performance is crucial in the solar energy context, as failing to detect faults can result in significant energy loss and increased maintenance costs.},

  abstract     = {In spite of the high potential shown by spiking neural networks (e.g., temporal patterns), training them remains an open and complex problem. In practice, while in theory these networks are computationally as powerful as mainstream artificial neural networks, they have not reached the same accuracy levels yet. The major reason for such a situation seems to be represented by the lack of adequate training algorithms for deep spiking neural networks, since spike signals are not differentiable, that is, no direct way to compute a gradient is provided. Recently, a novel training method, based on the (digital) simulation of certain quantum systems, has been suggested. It has already shown interesting advantages, among which is the fact that no gradient is required to be computed. In this work, we apply this approach to the problem of training spiking neural networks, and we show that this recent training method is capable of training deep and complex spiking neural networks on the MNIST data set.},

Manual processing of fundus images for the automated identification of ocular disorders is laborious, error-prone, and time-consuming. This necessitates computer-assisted technologies that can automatically identify different ocular illnesses from fundus images. The interpretation of the photos also plays a massive role in the diagnosis. Automating the diagnosing procedure reduces human mistakes and helps with early cataract detection. The oneDNN library available in the oneAPI Environment provided by Intel has been used to optimize all transfer learning models for better performance. The suggested approach is verified through a range of metrics in experiments using the openly accessible Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition dataset. The MobileNet Model outperformed other transfer learning techniques with an accuracy of 0.9836.},

However, they still have challenges when extracting information from highly specific internal technical documentation. One specific area of real-world technical documentation is telecommunications engineering, which could benefit from domain-specific LLMs. In this article, we expand the notion of Technical Language Processing (TLP) to the telecommunications domain by introducing and analyzing the format of technical specifications from a leading telecommunications equipment vendor. Additionally, we highlight the importance of use case definitions by introducing requirement property mapping for maximizing information extraction. Also, we recommend actions to mitigate the effect of the internal specifications format on information extraction, which can lead to LLM-friendly internal specifications. Finally, a PoC is built to showcase the improvements of our proposed framework.},

Inspired by the hierarchical structures of natural materials like spider silk, a strategy is developed to enhance both toughness and environmental tolerance in conductive hydrogels. By leveraging multiscale dynamics including pores, crystallization, and intermolecular interactions, a dense hierarchical structure is created that significantly improves toughness, reaching ≈90 MJ m⁻ 3 . This hydrogel withstands temperatures from −150 to 70 °C, pressure of 12 psi, and one-month storage under ambient conditions, while maintaining a lightweight profile of 0.25 g cm⁻ 3 . Additionally, its tunable rheological properties allow for high-resolution printing of desired shapes down to 220 µm, capable of supporting loads exceeding 164 kg m⁻ 2 . This study offers a versatile framework for designing durable materials for various applications.},

  abstract     = {Daytime radiative cooling presents a compelling technology, noted for its efficiency and environmental friendliness. Recent studies have focused on not only the cooling capacity but also the applicability and versatility of this technology. This study introduces a daytime radiative cooler as a sheet with exceptional cooling performance. Its matrix is composed of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which are emerging organic materials suitable for radiative cooling. Furthermore, aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) is employed as a supporting dielectric particle to enhance cooling performance. An Al 2 O 3 -assisted organic composite (AOC) is created through electrospinning and hot-pressing, resulting in a bendable sheet form. The AOC sheet demonstrates a light reflectance of 97.9% across the solar spectral region (0.3–2.5 µm) and an emissivity of 95.2% within the atmospheric transparency window (ATW) of 8–13 µm. The cooling power, derived from optical properties, is calculated to be 120.1 Wm −2 . Experimental findings confirm the AOC sheet&#39;s capability to achieve 4.9 °C below ambient temperature and, when applied to a car model, to reduce the interior temperature by 12.7 °C.},

  abstract     = {Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) represents a promising approach for cancer treatment. Compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT offers increased penetration depth and higher precision. However, the practical application of SDT is constrained by the low water solubility, poor tumor specificity, and metabolic susceptibility of most sonosensitizers. Recent research has explored the use of piezoelectric materials as sonosensitizers in cancer treatment and inhibition of bacterial growth. Upon ultrasound excitation, the separation of electron–hole (e − –h + ) pairs occurs within the piezoelectric material. By improving the crystal structure of the material or incorporating other nanoparticles to prevent rapid recombination of e − –h + pairs, the piezoelectric material accumulates charges in the conduction band and valence band, achieving the redox potential of O 2 /·O 2 − . This enables the piezoelectric material to serve as a sonosensitizer, leading to the concept termed Sono-Piezo Dynamic Therapy (SPDT). This review aims to define the concept of SPDT, provide a systematic overview of the historical development of piezoelectric materials in the application of SDT, and elucidate the potential mechanisms by which piezoelectric materials act as sonosensitizers. Importantly, various piezoelectric materials will be discussed in terms of their feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages as sonosensitizers, offering new perspectives for identifying potential sonosensitizers.},

Antitumor immunity refers to the innate and adaptive immune responses that regulate cancer development and proliferation. Tumor immune evasion represents a major hindrance to effective anticancer treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized and lipid-bilayer-enclosed particles that are secreted to the extracellular space by all cell types. They are critically involved in numerous biological functions including intercellular communication. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) can transport a variety of cargo to modulate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review provides the latest update about how tumor cells evade immune surveillance by exploiting TEVs. First, the biogenesis of EVs and the cargo-sorting machinery are discussed. Second, how tumor cells modulate immune cell differentiation, activation, and function via TEVs to evade immune surveillance is illustrated. Last but not least, the novel antitumor strategies that can reverse immune escape are summarized.},

The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, coordinating metabolism and immune responses to adapt to stress triggered by exogenous exposure. However, the impact of activating CAR on aging remains unknown. In this study, Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ), drug-induced premature aging mice, and senescence accelerated P8 (SAMP8) mice are used as models to explore the effects of CAR activation on lifespan and healthspan, along with the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that hCAR agonist CITCO and mCAR agonist TCPOBOP prolonged the lifespan and healthspan in model organism. The longevity effects of CITCO and TCPOBOP were attenuated in CAR homozygous nhr-8/daf-12 mutant C. elegans as well as CAR −/− mice. In C. elegans , CITCO activated both anti-stress and detoxification genes, and increased the resistance to environmental adversities. Additionally, the lifespan-extending and xenobiotic resistant effects of CITCO might be related to the regulation of age-related pathways. Furthermore, CITCO improved age-related neurodegeneration in C. elegans models. Taken together, the results suggest that the longevity effects of CAR agonists may be related to the enhancement of xenobiotic resistance of animals.},

Muscle cell apoptosis is considered one of the main causes of muscle atrophy, while several recent studies argued that muscle cells do not die during muscle atrophy. Here, sensor zebrafish are generated to visualize muscle cell apoptosis and the engulfment of dead muscle cells by macrophages. Using these sensor zebrafish, starvation, and natural aging-induced muscle atrophy models are established. The data showed that the diameters of muscle cells decreased in both models; however, muscle cell apoptosis is not found in the process of muscle atrophy. In starvation-induced muscle atrophy, it also showed that the number of nuclei in muscle cells remained constant, and there is no increase in the number of macrophages in muscle tissues, both of which further confirmed that muscle cells do not die. In both models, transcriptional analysis showed that the apoptosis pathway is down-regulated, and autophagy and protein degradation pathways are up-regulated. All these data indicated that although there is a great reduction of muscle mass during starvation or aging-induced muscle atrophy, muscle cells do not die by apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into muscle atrophy and can benefit the treatments for muscle atrophy-related diseases.},

However, its application is often limited by damage caused by electrode movement, as flexible sensors are typically attached to joints, which can be greatly alleviated by placing the two electrodes on the same side. Inspired by the hydrogen bonds in the double-helical structure of DNA, the double-helical electrode design is commonly found and applied in fiber-based batteries and supercapacitors into fibrous flexible sensors through coaxial wet-spinning and further treatment. The double helical sensor exhibits high strength and maintains stable operation and is prepared under over 300% strain with gauge factors (GF) of 0.9, 39.5, and 349, respectively, in its working ranges. This unique single-sided electrode structure also enabled applications such as water flow sensing. The sensor into a smart glove capable of real-time is further integrated, five-channel finger motion detection, and used a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning algorithm to achieve 98.8% accuracy in recognizing six common gestures. This study provides a novel approach to optimize the electrode distribution in fiber-based flexible sensors through an internally encapsulated double-helical structure, making a significant contribution to the field of flexible sensing.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cells cope with oxidative stress for their proliferation and metastasis by equipping antioxidant systems, among which the antioxidant enzymes peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) play crucial roles. However, whether PRDXs exhibit nonenzymatic functions remains unclear. Here, it is shown that the 1-cysteine PRDX (PRDX6) upregulates nicotinamide N -methyltransferase (NNMT) to promote the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells, independently of PRDX6&#39;s enzymatic activities. Mechanistically, PRDX6 interacts with NNMT to prevent its binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite-motif protein 56 (TRIM56), leading to the inhibition of NNMT ubiquitination at lysine 23 and 210 and suppression of subsequent proteasomal degradation. In addition, PRDX6-mediated NNMT upregulation activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, thereby promoting the growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. Notably, PRDX6 overexpression is associated with higher NNMT protein levels in human ovarian cancer tissues and is predictive of poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. Overall, the findings illustrate a critical oncogenic mechanism of the antioxidant enzyme PRDX6 in promoting ovarian cancer progression beyond its enzymatic mechanisms.},

For instance, in mammals, the chaperones ANP32A and ANP32B share a common evolutionary line and have some exchangeable functions based on their similar N-terminal domains. Nevertheless, their C-terminal low-complexity-acidic-regions (LCARs) display substantial sequence differences, unveiling some degree of variability between them, in agreement with their different tissue-specific expression patterns. These structural and computational results indicate that a substitution in the vicinity of the nuclear localization signal (NLS), of Pro in ANP32A for Thr in ANP32B, determines the overall compactness of the C-terminal LCAR. The different structural properties of the disordered region affect the binding mode of ANP32 members to their targets. This type of divergent binding mode is exemplified with the extra-mitochondrial cytochrome c (C c ), a well-known ANP32B partner and which now determine also binds to ANP32A; and with the RNA binding protein HuR, whose export to the cytoplasm is mediated by ANP32 proteins under stress. Therefore, differential expression patterns of ANP32A or ANP32B may affect the regulation of C c and HuR and can help to explain the distinct roles of these proteins in diseases.},

Protein arginine methyltransferases 5 (PRMT5) plays a crucial role in regulating homeostasis of various mammalian tissues. However, its function in intestinal homeostasis remains elusive. In this study, conditional knockout of Prmt5 in the mouse intestinal epithelium leads to a reduction in stem cell population, suppression of cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis within the intestinal crypts, accompanied with shortened gut length, decreased mouse body weight, and eventual animal mortality. Additionally, Prmt5 deletion or its enzymatic inhibition in intestinal organoids in vitro also shows resembling cellular phenotypes. Methylome profiling identifies 90 potential Prmt5 substrates, which are involved in RNA-related biological processes and cell division. Consistently, Prmt5 depletion in intestinal organoids leads to aberrant alternative splicing in a subset of genes related to the mitotic cell cycle. Furthermore, Prmt5 loss triggers p53-mediated apoptosis in the intestinal epithelium. Collectively, the findings uncover an indispensable role of PRMT5 in promoting cell proliferation and survival, as well as maintaining stem cells in the gut epithelium.},

Here an efficient sintering method is presented using ultralow power UV by leveraging the photocleavable ligand, o -nitrobenzyl thiol (NT), – functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The controlled removal of NT ligands upon UV irradiation enhances light absorption by reducing the filling factor of voids in the printed layer, increasing the layer temperature, and facilitating further ligand desorption. This positive feedback mechanism accelerates nanoparticle sintering at several orders of magnitude lower energy than IPL, achieving an electrical conductivity of 7.0 × 10 6 S m −1 .

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial transfer emerges as a promising therapy for the restoration of mitochondrial function in damaged cells, mainly due to its limited immunogenicity. However, isolated mitochondria rapidly lose function because they produce little energy outside cells. Therefore, this study investigates whether near infrared (NIR)-mediated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) pre-treatment enhances mitochondrial function and stability in mitochondria-donor cells prior to transplantation. Clinical applications of NADH, an essential electron donor in the oxidative phosphorylation process, are restricted due to the limited cellular uptake of NADH. To address this, a photo-mediated method optimizes direct NADH delivery into cells and increases NADH absorption. L6 cells treated with NADH and irradiated with NIR enhanced NADH uptake, significantly improving mitochondrial energy production and function. Importantly, the improved functional characteristics of the mitochondria are maintained even after isolation from cells. Primed mitochondria, i.e., those enhanced by NIR-mediated NADH uptake (P-MT), are encapsulated in fusogenic liposomes and delivered into muscle cells with mitochondrial dysfunction. Compared to conventional mitochondria, P-MT mitochondria promote greater mitochondrial recovery and muscle regeneration. These findings suggest that NIR-mediated NADH delivery is an effective strategy for improving mitochondrial function, and has the potential to lead to novel treatments for mitochondrial disorders and muscle degeneration.},

  abstract     = {Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials are attractive due to their unique applications in fields such as 3D displays, information encryption, and chiroptical switches. Natural biomolecules-based CPL materials are gaining plenty of attention due to their chiral diversity and sustainability. However, it is still challenging to construct CPL materials with opposite CPL signs from a single natural biomolecule due to its inherent chirality. Here, chiral assemblies with opposite CPL signs using chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) and achiral luminescent dyes are successfully prepared. It is found that COS can serve as a chiral template to induce the ordered assembly of the dyes along the polymer chain through electrostatic attraction interaction. It is demonstrated experimentally that the structural planarity of the dye molecules is crucial for the formation of chiral co-assemblies. Interestingly, the left-handed COS-templated co-assemblies can emit CPL with opposite handedness, which is controlled by the helicity degree of the co-assemblies. This study not only deepens the understanding of the complex assembly of natural biomacromolecules but also provides new insights into the design and construction of CPL materials.},

However, this vascular neogenesis takes place at a microscopic scale that cannot be observed with current clinical imaging techniques. Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) allows us to observe micro-vessels of the order of a few microns at depths of several centimeters. This can be done using conventional clinical ultrasound scanners and contrast sequences (CEUS). In this study, ULM is used to observe the human microvasculature in neonatal patients undergoing treatment for life-threatening malformations forming direct connections between the cerebral arterial and venous systems. It is observed that neuroendovascular treatment of neonatal arteriovenous malformations causes remodeling and reorganization of the cerebral vasculature by also activating corticomedullary vascular connections. ULM enables us to follow microvascular changes in human neonates with high spatio-temporal resolution. ULM may provide a novel clinical translatable tool, particularly including cerebral imaging in very young patients.},

The Golgi apparatus (GA) of tumor cells is a key organelle in the formation of a tumor immunosuppressive network. However, there are no studies to show whether interfering with the GA of tumor cells can reshape the immunosuppressive network to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Therefore, the tumor cell GA-targeting self-assembled peptide (NF-1) is tailored, and confirmed that NF-1 treatment can achieve an effective immunotherapy and found that tumor cell-derived GA-dependent migration inhibitory factor (MIF) mediates the formation of immunosuppressive network in breast cancer (BRCA) through multi-omics analysis, in vivo, and in vitro experiments. NF-1 treatment-induced MIF reduction can reshape the immunosuppressive network and convert a “cold” tumor into a “hot” tumor, thus enabling immunotherapy in BRCA and enhancing the ICB efficacy in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). This study presents a general strategy for interfering with tumor GA for effective immunotherapy in BRCA, COAD, and other cancers characterized by a “cold” immune microenvironment.},

However, there is a lack of a facile method to realize the controllable growth of large-scale, high-quality, and high-resolution perovskite single crystal arrays on diverse types of substrates, which hinders their application in practical scenarios. Here, a one-step wettability-guided blade coating approach is reported for the rapid in situ crystallization of large-scale, multicolor, and sub-100 nm perovskite single-crystal arrays in the ambient environment. By this strategy, the physical dimensions of perovskite single crystals can be precisely regulated from 90 to 260 nm, with a size variation coefficient &lt; 10% and an area of over 900 mm 2 . All three typicalhalogen perovskites for multi-color luminescence, CsPbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, I) and their mixtures (Cl/Br or Br/I systems), are appliable to this fabrication process through the demonstration of complex RGB patterns with remarkable photoluminescence properties. Moreover, various rigid substrates such as silicon oxide (SiO 2 ), silicon (Si), and glass can also be used to construct the wettability-constrast templates where perovskite crystal nucleate and grow. After that, the perovskite single-crystal arrays or complex patterns can be transferred onto flexible substrates, for instance, COC. This method combines convenient solution processing with conventional photolithography to prepare the high-resolution, large-area, and superior-quality perovskite single crystal arrays in a high-throughput manner, showing great potential in the integration of perovskite nano-optoelectronic devices and chips.},

However, the limited cyclability of vanadium-based oxide cathodes, especially at low current densities, impedes their practical application. Here, it is revealed that proton insertion is responsible for the limited lifetime of vanadium oxides. Proton insertion promotes the dissolution of vanadium oxides, deteriorating electrochemical performance. Propylene carbonate (PC) is introduced into Zn(CF 3 SO 3 ) 2 electrolyte to regulate the coordination environment of water, forming PC-coordinated Zn 2+ solvation structure and [H 2 O-CF 3 SO 3 − -PC] complex. The optimized coordination environment of water weakens the adsorption energy between water molecules and vanadium oxides, inhibiting proton insertion. As a result, vanadium-based oxides cathode without proton insertion can maintain the stability of crystal structure and avoid the dissolution of V. Taking CaV 8 O 20 ·nH 2 O as cathode, Zn||CaV 8 O 20 ·nH 2 O battery without proton insertion performs enhanced cycling performance.

However, the weak photostability always leads to inevitable photolysis of GO during the use, storage, and application. Indirect photolysis has a significant impact on the structure of GO via causing fragmentation and degradation, while the pathway can be divided into two stages. In the early stage, photoreduction is the dominant reaction to generate porous reduction GO (PrGO). Then H 2 O 2 breaks PrGO into fragments, and eventually, the fragmented GO is converted into CO 2 by OH radicals. The generation of porous structures in early photoreduction is a crucial premise for the subsequent photodegradation, while GO flakes without porous structure cannot be broken by H 2 O 2 and OH. In this work, a deep insight into the indirect photolysis pathway and the committed step is provided, which may bring some advanced ideas for enhancing GO stability in practical application.},

The SN-doped electrolyte successfully inhibits the lithium dendrite growth and facilitates the SEI layer formation, as determined by the operando nanofocus wide-angle X-ray scattering (nWAXS), meanwhile, stably cycled over 500 h in Li/SN-PEO/Li cell. Apart from the observation of lithium dendrite, the robust SEI layer formation mechanism in the first cycle is investigated in the SN-enhanced composite electrolyte by nWAXS. The inorganic electrochemical reaction products, LiF and Li 3 N, are found to initially deposit on the electrolyte side, progressively extending toward the lithium metal anode. This growth process effectively protected the metallic lithium, inhibited electron transfer, and facilitated Li⁺ transport.

Effective treatment is, however, challenging due to the physical barrier of the cornea, which restricts drug penetration in the eye, as well as the presence of eye injury that necessitates continuous delivery of growth factors on the ocular surface for cornea healing. Here, we introduce a transformative wearable corneal microneedle (MN) patch designed for efficient therapy of ocular injury and infection. The MN patch comprises water-soluble tips that encapsulate antibacterial nanoparticles (NPs), along with a transformative backing layer that contains epidermal growth factor (EGF). Upon insertion into the eye, the MN tips dissolve swiftly within the cornea stroma, resulting in the release of the antimicrobial NPs to efficiently eradicate bacteria. Meanwhile, the residual backing layer undergoes rapid in situ transformation upon contact with mildly acidic fluid from infected corneal edema, converting into a contact lens that conforms to the eye&#39;s surface, which facilitates sustained release of EGF on the ocular surface over 8 h to promote corneal healing. Benefiting from these features, the designed transformative corneal MN patch demonstrates superior efficacy in treating ocular injuries and infections in vivo, offering a promising therapeutic strategy to manage eye diseases.},

Here, multi-color fluorescence microscopy is applied to track the assembly of both liposomes and mRNA simultaneously in clinical mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy. Imaging reveals that the assembly occurs in discrete steps: initially, RNA adsorbs onto the liposomes; then, the RNA-coated liposomes cluster into heterogeneous structures ranging from sub-micrometer to tens of micrometers. The clustering process is consistent with a Smoluchowski model with a Brownian diffusion kernel. The transition between the two steps of assembly is determined by the orientation of RNA-mediated interactions.

  abstract     = {Sound-evoked wakefulness from sleep is crucial in daily life, yet its neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is found that CaMKIIα+ neurons in the temporal association cortex (TeA) of mice are not essential for natural awakening from sleep. However, optogenetic activation of these neurons reliably induces wakefulness from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but not from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In vivo electrophysiological and calcium recordings further demonstrated that TeA neurons are monotonically tuned to sound intensity but not frequency. More importantly, it is found that the activity of CaMKIIα+ neurons in TeA can gate sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep, which is further confirmed by optogenetic manipulations. Further investigation reveals that the baseline excitability of TeA CaMKIIα+ neurons and the delta oscillations in the electroencephalogram are particularly important in regulating the evoked activity of TeA neurons. Anatomical and functional screening of downstream targets of TeA reveals that excitatory projections from TeA glutamatergic neurons to glutamatergic neurons in the basolateral/lateral amygdala are critical for modulating sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep. These findings uncover a top-down regulatory circuit that selectively governs sound-evoked arousal from NREM sleep, with the TeA functioning as a key connecting cortex to subcortical regions.},

  abstract     = {Bionic neural devices often feature complex structures with multiple interfaces, requiring extensive post-processing. In this paper, a neural device with intrinsic perception and decision-making (NDIPD), inspired by neuronal oscillatory activity is introduced. The device utilizes alternating signals generated by coupling the human body with the power-frequency electromagnetic field as both a signal source and energy source, mimicking neuronal oscillatory activity. The peaks and valleys of the alternating signal are differentially modulated to replicate the baseline shift process in neuronal oscillatory activity. By comparing the amplitude of the peaks and valleys in the NDIPD&#39;s electrical output signal, the device achieves intrinsic perception and decision-making regarding the location of mechanical stimulation. This is accomplished using a single interface, which reduces data transmission, simplifies functionality, and eliminates the need for an external power supply. The NDIPD demonstrates a low-pressure detection limit (&lt;0.02 N), fast response time (&lt;20 ms), and exceptional stability (&gt;200 000 cycles). It shows great potential for applications such as game control, UAV navigation, and virtual vehicle driving. The innovative energy supply method and sensing mechanism are expected to open new avenues in the development of bionic neural devices.},

  abstract     = {Developing efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts to replace expensive carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction remains an important challenge. Recently, an innovative catalyst, composed of ruthenium single atoms (Ru 1 ) integrated with small Ru nanoclusters (Ru NC ), has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community. However, because of its complexity, this catalyst remains a topic of some debate. Here, a method is reported of precisely controlling the ratios of Ru 1 to Ru NC on a nitrogenated carbon (NC)-based porous organic framework to produce Ru/NC catalysts, by using different amounts (0, 5, 10 wt.%) of reducing agent. The Ru/NC–10 catalyst, formed with 10 wt.% reducing agent, delivered the best performance under alkaline conditions, indicating that Ru NC played a significant role in actual alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) system using the Ru/NC–10 catalyst required a significantly lower operating voltage (1.72 V) than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (1.95 V) to achieve 500 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the system can be operated at 100 mA cm −2 without notable performance decay for over 180 h. Theoretical calculations supported these experimental findings that Ru 1 contributed to the water dissociation process, while Ru NC is more actively associated with the hydrogen recombination process.},

  abstract     = {The incidence of kidney stones is increasing worldwide. However, the underlying mechanism of the process of kidney stone formation and the kidney damage caused are not well understood. Here, it is observed that Lgals3, a β-galactoside-binding protein, is significantly increased in tissues with calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones, and in both in vivo and in vitro models. Lgals3 expression is positively correlated with the deposition of CaOx crystals. Knockout of Lgals3 markedly reduces the deposition of CaOx crystal and renal fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, Lgals3 deficiency decrease the glycolytic rate and lactate production during the process of CaOx deposition and inhibited histone lactylation of H3K18la. Mechanistic studies shows that Lgals3 directly interacted with the key glycolysis protein pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and promoted its expression by modulating E3 ligase Trim21, preventing the ubiquitination of PKM2. Furthermore, H3K18 lactylation promoted CaOx crystal deposition and kidney injury in vivo and in vitro. Lgals3 deficiency inhibites the transcription, activation, and expression of FGFR4 through inhibition of H3K18la. These findings suggest that Lgals3 may play a key role in CaOx stone formation and kidney injury by interacting with PKM2 and promoting both H3K18la-mediated gene transcription and activation.},

Herein, a high-performance hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/ β -Ga 2 O 3 heterostructure junction field-effect transistor (HJFET) is fabricated, exhibiting an off-state current as low as ≈10 fA, a high on/off current ratio of ≈10 8 , a low contact resistance of 5.6 Ω·mm, and an impressive field-effect electron mobility of 156 cm 2 （Vs） −1 . Notably, the current h-BN/ β -Ga 2 O 3 HJFET exhibits outstanding thermal reliability in the ultra-wide temperature range from 223 to 573 K, as well as long-term environmental stability in air, which confirms its inherent capability of operation in harsh environments. Moreover, the h-BN/ β -Ga 2 O 3 HJFET demonstrates successful applications for accelerator-in-memory computing fields, including dynamic random-access memory structure and neural network computations. These superior characteristics position β -Ga₂O₃-based electronics as highly promising for applications in extreme environments, with particular relevance to the automotive, aerospace, and sensor sectors.},

By employing the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN), the transition of the network&#39;s Poisson&#39;s ratio from positive to negative as the hexagonal structural element shifts from a convex polygon to a concave polygon was accurately predicted. The KAN provides a clear mathematical framework that describes this transition, revealing the connection between the Poisson&#39;s ratio and the geometric properties of the hexagonal element, and accurately identifying the geometric parameters at which the Poisson&#39;s ratio equals zero.

This study enrolled 2279 patients across 12 centers and develops a novel multi-modality model integrating longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spatial habitat radiomics, transcriptomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing for predicting pCR. By analyzing tumor subregions on multi-timepoint MRI, the model captures dynamic intra-tumoral heterogeneity during NAT. It shows superior performance over traditional radiomics, with areas under the curve of 0.863, 0.813, and 0.888 in the external validation, immunotherapy, and multi-omics cohorts, respectively. Subgroup analysis shows its robustness across varying molecular subtypes and clinical stages. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that high model scores correlate with increased immune activity, notably elevated B cell infiltration, indicating the biological basis of the imaging model. The integration of imaging and molecular data demonstrates promise in spatial habitat radiomics to monitor dynamic changes in tumor heterogeneity during NAT. In clinical practice, this study provides a noninvasive tool to accurately predict pCR, with the potential to guide treatment planning and improve breast-conserving surgery rates. Despite promising results, the model requires prospective validation to confirm its utility across diverse patient populations and clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {2D metal-chalcogenide nanoplatelets (NPLs) exhibit promising photocatalysis properties due to their ultrathin morphology, high surface-to-volume ratio, and enhanced in-plane electron transport mobility. However, NPLs, especially cadmium chalcogenides, encounter challenges in CO 2 photoreduction due to insufficient solar energy utilization and fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Defect engineering offers a potential solution but often encounters difficulties maintaining structural integrity, mechanical stability, and electrical conductivity. Herein, by taking two monolayers (2ML) CdSe NPLs as a model system, selenium (Se) vacancies confined in atomic layers can enhance charge separation and conductivity. A straightforward approach to create Se vacancies in various monolayers CdSe NPLs (2, 4, and 5ML) has been developed, enabling efficient CO 2 photoreduction with a 4-fold increase in CO generation compared to their defect-free counterparts. Significantly, accounting for higher charge density and efficient carrier transport due to Se vacancies, defective 2ML CdSe NPLs (V Se -2ML CdSe) exhibit CO evolution performance up to 2557.5 µmol g − ¹ h − ¹ with no significant decay over 5 h, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of common semiconductor catalysts.

Despite the great complexity of kinetics, it is clear that lithium-ion desolvation and a subsequent step of crossing through cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) are crucial to high-rate performance, in which the two key steps depend heavily on the working electrolyte formula. In this work, a customized electrolyte is developed to coordinate ion desolvation and interphase formation by introducing vinylene carbonate (VC), triphenylboroxin (TPBX), and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) but excluding ethylene carbonate (EC). Serving Ni-rich cathodes, the customized electrolyte generates a double-layered CEI, LiF-dominated inorganics inner layer, and ROCOOLi-dominated organics outer layer, which is not only stable and very efficient for lithium ion transport. Meanwhile, a -dominated solvation structure is induced and effectively decreases the desolvation energy to 29.72 kJ mol −1 , supporting fast lithium ion transport in the cathode interfacial processes. Consequently, the Ni-rich lithium-ion battery achieves a stable long cycle at a superior high rate of 10 C.},

Methods: Herein, the biological roles of TUG1 and HuR in angiogenesis are first confirmed. Following that, HuR-binding VEGFA mRNAs are identified via the Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP), and Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assays. Actinomycin D and polysomal assays are also employed to confirm VEGFA mRNA stability. The co-localization of TUG1 with HuR is confirmed using FISH, while the RIP and RNA pull-down assays are employed to elucidate their interplay. The direct binding between TUG1 and HuR is confirmed through the CLIP assay. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and rescue experiments are performed to further elucidate TUG1-HuR interactions. Results: While TUG1 repressed angiogenesis and aggravated CIRI, HuR exerted contrary effects. Specifically, HuR bound directly to VEGFA mRNA, a phenomenon that enhanced VEGFA mRNA stability. Conversely, TUG1 binds to HuR directly, inhibiting its nuclear translocation and promoting its ubiquitination, ultimately reducing VEGFA mRNA stability. Conclusions: It is found that TUG1 can inhibit angiogenesis in CIRI through the HuR/VEGFA mRNA axis.},

  abstract     = {Sustained β-adrenergic activation induces cardiac fibrosis characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) receptor EP4 is essential for cardiovascular homeostasis. This study aims to investigate the roles of cardiomyocyte (CM) and cardiac fibroblast (CF) EP4 in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac fibrosis. By crossing the EP4 f/f mice with α-MyHC-Cre or S100A4-Cre mice, this work obtains the CM-EP4 knockout (EP4 f/f -α-MyHC Cre+ ) or CF-EP4 knockout (EP4 f/f -S100A4 Cre+ ) mice. The mice of both genders are subcutaneously injected with ISO (5 mg kg −1 day −1 ) for 7 days. Compared to the control mice, both EP4 f/f -α-MyHC Cre+ and EP4 f/f -S100A4 Cre+ mice show a significant improvement in cardiac diastolic function and fibrosis as assessed by echocardiography and histological staining, respectively. In the CMs, inhibition of EP4 suppresses ISO-induced TGF-β1 expression via blocking the cAMP/PKA pathway. In the CFs, inhibition of EP4 reversed TGF-β1-triggers production of ECM via preventing the formation of the TGF-β1/TGF-β receptor complex and blocks CF proliferation via suppressing the ERK1/2 pathway. Furthermore, double knockout of the CM- and CF-EP4 or administration of EP4 antagonist, grapiprant, markedly improves ISO-induced cardiac diastolic dysfunction and fibrosis. Collectively, this study demonstrates that both CM-EP4 and CF-EP4 contribute to β-adrenergic activation-induced cardiac fibrosis. Targeting EP4 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for cardiac fibrosis.},

  abstract     = {Trophic interactions in micro-food webs, such as those between nematodes and their bacterial prey, affect nitrogen cycling in soils, potentially changing nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production and consumption. However, how nematode-mediated changes in soil bacterial community composition affect soil N 2 O emissions is largely unknown. Here, microcosm experiments are performed with the bacterial feeding nematode Protorhabditis to explore the potential of nematodes in regulating microbial communities and thereby soil N 2 O emissions. Removal of nematodes by defaunation resulted in increased N 2 O emissions, with the removal of Protorhabditis contributing most to this increase. Further, inoculation with Protorhabditis altered bacterial community composition and increased the relative abundance of Bacillus , and the abundance of the nosZ gene in soil. In vitro experiments indicated that Protorhabditis reinforce the reduction in N 2 O emissions by Bacillus due to suppressing competitors and producing bacteria growth stimulating substances such as betaine. The results indicate that interactions between nematodes and bacteria modify N 2 O emissions providing the perspective for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions via manipulating trophic interactions in soil.},

  abstract     = {Localized liquid secretion, being an important process in nature such as the secretion of tears or mucus, has been an attractive point in developing biomimetic materials. However, precise localization remains challenging due to the cohesive and mobile nature of liquids. In this paper, light-induced localized liquid secretion is demonstrated on the scale of tens of micrometers by a liquid crystal polymer coating with an alternating homeotropic-planar alignment. The light responsiveness is achieved by the incorporation of azobenzene derivative. The localization is achieved by applying regional through-thickness electric fields to the monomeric liquid crystals before polymerization. The polymerized coating preserves both homeotropic and planar alignment. Upon actuation, the liquid can be locally secreted from the homeotropic region while suppressed in the planar area. This method allows precise control over various secretion patterns based on different pre-designed electrodes, which paves the way for the development of responsive devices in a multitude of fields, such as targeted drug delivery, tissue engineering, and microfluidic devices.},

Unlike traditional heterojunction photocatalysts, homojunction features different energy bandgaps with interchangeable compositions that can significantly trigger charge carrier dynamics, but their precise construction remains an ongoing challenge owing to quick lattice-level modulations. Herein, TiO 2 -based homojunction (HT M-OH ) holding dissimilar yet discernible crystalline phases (anatase and rutile) are rationally constructed by a straightforward alkali-induced strategy which enables controllable lattice-transition/orientation. The resulting HT M-OH exhibits speedy separation and well-guided flow of e − -h + over redox sites with extended carrier lifetime, leading to high-rate hydrogen generation (HER, 34.35 mmol g −1 h −1 ) under simulated sunlight. Moreover, a self-made thin film of HT M-OH indicates a notable scale-up potential under real-time sunlight. This work furnishes a new non-complex homojunction strategy for speeding charge carrier kinetics, credibly extendable to a diverse range of catalysts and applications.},

Moreover, the rougher fiber surface morphology and weaken hydrophilicity cause the adjacent bubbles are slower to detach from the electrode and are more likely to fusion. The measured diameter of bubbles leaving the electrode almost doubles, while the total number of bubbles decreases by about two-thirds, causing the increase of plug flow in the flow field and deteriorating the performance and long-term stability of AEMWE.},

Quercetin, one of the most important dietary flavonoids, is being explored as an effective therapy for obesity with its mechanism remains understudied. Here in this study, it is demonstrated that quercetin intervention significantly reverses obesity-related phenotypes through reshaping the overall structure of microbiota, especially boosting colonization of the beneficial gut commensal Akkermansia muciniphila ( A. muciniphila ). Enrichment of A. muciniphila leads to generate more indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) to upregulate the expression of 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) via fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)/ N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A)/YTHDF2 manner, thereby facilitating cholesterol converts to cholic acid (CA). CA in turn drastically suppresses lipid accumulation via activating the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in adipose tissue. This work introduces a novel therapeutic target for addressing obesity and expands upon the current limited understanding of the mediator function of m 6 A modifications in microorganism-influenced bile acid (BA) metabolism.},

Here, it is shown that a plant-specific RAV-type transcription factor, OsRAV15, is specifically targeted by several distinct viral proteins for facilitating viral infection. OsRAV15 is found to activate jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated broad-spectrum antiviral immunity by physically associating with JA signaling essential components OsMYC2-OsJAZ complex. To facilitate viral infection, evolutionarily distinct viral proteins encoded by diverse rice viruses generally disrupt the OsRAV15-OsMYC2 complex to attenuate activation of JA signaling. Together, the results reveal a common counter-defense strategy used by different viruses to suppress the OsRAV15-OsMYC2 module that plays a vital role in fine-tuning JA-mediated antiviral defense.},

In this work, a model laser-fabricated rotating lattice Sb 2 S 3 crystal grown in stoichiometric glass is used to demonstrate fabrication of novel macroperiodic metastructures that utilize intrinsic lattice curvature superimposed with subtle crystallographic influences. The limited availability of slip systems drives the lattice curvature magnitude to vary with crystal growth direction, maximizing for lattices aligned with the predominant Burgers vector along with corresponding increases in dislocation density. Misaligned lattice orientations form smaller secondary lattice curvatures arising from misaligned Burgers vectors with further elastic contributions. Over extended crystal growth, these secondary components align the lattice to rotate about either the &lt;001&gt; or &lt;010&gt; crystal axes forming repeating metastructures of lattice orientation with periodicity 20–160 microns in length.

Despite the facile design of DNA hybridization probes, their limited specificity poses challenges in clinical applications. Here, a differential reaction pathway probe (DRPP) based on a dynamic DNA reaction network is presented. DRPP leverages differences in reaction intermediate concentrations between SNV and WT groups, directing them into distinct reaction pathways. This generates a strong pulse-like signal for SNV and a weak unidirectional increase signal for wild-type (WT). Through the application of machine learning to fluorescence kinetic data analysis, the classification of SNV and WT signals is automated with an accuracy of 99.6%, significantly exceeding the 80.7% accuracy of conventional methods. Additionally, sensitivity for variant allele frequency (VAF) is enhanced down to 0.1%, representing a ten-fold improvement over conventional approaches. DRPP accurately identified D614G and N501Y SNVs in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 variants in patient swab samples with accuracy over 99% (n = 82). It determined the VAF of ovarian cancer-related mutations KRAS-G12R , NRAS-G12C , and BRAF-V600E in both tissue and blood samples (n = 77), discriminating cancer patients and healthy individuals with significant difference ( p &lt; 0.001).

This phenomenon provides a potential basis for the development of treatment strategies for tissue damage and degeneration. This study aims to evaluate whether mitochondria isolated from osteoblasts can promote osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Mitochondria from MSCs, which primarily utilize glycolysis, are compared with those from MG63 cells, which depend on oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria from both cell types are then encapsulated in cationic liposomes and transferred to MSCs, and their impact on differentiation is assessed. Mitochondria delivery from MG63 cells to MSCs grown in both two- and three-dimensional cultures results in increased expression of osteogenic markers, including Runt-related transcription factor 2, Osterix, and Osteopontin, and upregulation of genes involved in Bone morphogenetic protein 2 signaling and calcium import. This is accompanied by increased calcium influx and regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Transplantation of spheroids containing MSCs with MG63-derived mitochondria in bone defect animal models improves bone regeneration. The results suggest that delivery of MG63-derived mitochondria effectively guides MSCs toward osteogenesis, paving the way for the development of mitochondria-transplantation therapies.},

The findings revealed opposing alterations in the expression levels of the cellular senescence pathway after radiotherapy in patients with local and distant relapses. In contrast, an increase in the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition module after radiotherapy in both relapse groups is observed. Cell–cell interactions, drug-target expression analyses in malignant cells after radiation, and multiplex immunofluorescence of tumor tissue identified interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL1R1) as a potential therapeutic target.

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) resistance to chemoradiotherapy is a major factor contributing to poor treatment outcomes. This resistance markedly affects the effectiveness of surgery combined with chemoradiotherapy and leads to post-surgical tumor recurrence. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying chemoradiotherapy resistance in GBM is crucial for understanding its progression and improving therapeutic options. This study found that moesin (MSN) acts as a key promotor of chemoradiotherapy resistance in glioma stem cells (GSCs), enhancing their proliferation and stemness maintenance. Mechanistically, MSN activates the downstream PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, driving the proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) in GSCs. This process enhances the repair of DNA damage caused by radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), thereby increasing the resistance of GSCs to chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, GNE-317, a small molecule drug capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, specifically inhibits MSN and suppresses the activation of downstream PI3K/mTOR signaling. Importantly, the combination of GNE-317 with RT and TMZ exhibits a strong synergistic effect both in vivo and in vitro, achieving better efficacy compared to the traditional combination of RT and TMZ. This study not only advances understanding of the mechanisms underlying chemoradiotherapy resistance in GBM but also provides a promising new approach for enhancing treatment outcomes.},

Herein, the broad-spectrum capture and detection capability of the antibody-free electropositive nanoprobe are clarified for bacteria for the first time and an ultrasensitive fluorescent ICA platform is constructed for the simultaneous diagnosis of multiple pathogens. A magnetic multilayer quantum dot nanocomposite with an amino-embedded SiO 2 shell (MagMQD@Si + ) is designed to enrich bacteria from solutions effectively, offer high luminescence, and reduce background signals on test strips, thus greatly improving the sensitivity and stability of ICA technique for pathogen. The superior performance of the MagMQD@Si + -based ICA through the multiplex detection of three common pathogens is demonstrated, namely, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Salmonella typhimurium , showing that this ICA possesses high sensitivity (8–40 cells mL −1 ), good reproducibility (relative standard deviation &lt; 5.4%), and high specificity for the three target bacteria. The clinical utility of the proposed method is verified through the detection of 30 real sputum samples from patients with bacterial respiratory infections, revealing that the MagMQD@Si + -based ICA has massive potential as a powerful inspection tool for the rapid, sensitive, and ultrasensitive diagnosis of bacterial infections.

In this study, pancreatic lesions in patients diagnosed as either type 1 AIP or type 2 AIP are examined, and these patients’ peripheral blood at single-cell level. Furthermore, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and functional assays are performed to verify the identified cell subtypes. In type 1 AIP, there is a notable increase in the amount of B cells and plasma cells, and IgG4+ plasma cells are key pathogenic cells of AIP. The differentiation path of naïve-stage B cells into IgG4+ produced plasma cells is observed, and an increased amount of T helper cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. This study also reveals that HIF-1α, an activated transcriptional factor, can directly bind to promoter site of NAMPT, promoting higher levels of visfatin production in HIF1A+ classical monocytes. Pancreatic stellate cells can be activated by extracellular visfatin and promote the development of fibrotic response in pancreatic lesions across both AIP subtypes. The current findings shed light on the exploration of dynamic alterations in peripheral blood cells and cell subgroups in pancreatic lesions of AIP, while elucidating a pathogenic cell subset and potential fibrosis mechanism of AIP.},

  abstract     = {The coordination of public and private goods production is essential for bacterial adaptation to environmental changes. Quorum sensing (QS) regulates this balance by mediating the trade-off between the communal benefits of “public goods,” such as siderophores and antibiotics, and the individual metabolic needs fulfilled by “private goods,” such as intracellular metabolites utilized for growth and survival. Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 harbors a LasI/LasR-type QS system, MupI/MupR, which regulates mupirocin production through signaling molecules. This study explores how QS coordinates carbon and nitrogen metabolism to optimize the production of key secondary metabolites, including 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), mupirocin, and siderophores, which serve as public goods. Loss of QS disrupts this balance by enhancing the Krebs cycle, denitrification, pyruvate anaplerosis, and ammonium assimilation, lead to halted 2,4-DAPG and mupirocin synthesis and increased siderophore production. In the absence of QS, elevated siderophore production compensates for iron acquisition, ensuring rapid cellular growth. Under nutrient-limited or high cell density conditions, MupR regulates carbon and nitrogen fluxes to sustain public goods production. These findings highlight QS as a key environmental sensor that fine-tunes resource allocation, bacterial fitness, and adaptation to ecological and nutritional conditions, suggesting the potential for QS-targeted approaches to enhance antibiotic production and agricultural sustainability.},

Forkhead box P1 (Foxp1) regulates embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart development. However, whether Foxp1 participates in postnatal-injury cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration remains unclear. This study demonstrates that Foxp1 is downregulated at border zone cardiomyocytes of both neonatal apical resection and adult myocardial infarction. Analysis of the Single-cell transcriptome database reveals reduced Foxp1 expression in the cardiomyocyte population with high regenerative capacity. Cardiomyocyte-Foxp1 loss-of-function significantly promotes, whereas cardiomyocytes-Foxp1 gain-of-function suppresses cardiomyocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, Foxp1 directly regulates ubiquitin specific peptidase 20 (USP20), a de-ubiquitinase that prevents hypoxia inducible factor 1ɑ (HIF1α) degradation. Thus, Foxp1 regulates HIF1α and downstream heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1 (Hand1) to control the cardiomyocyte proliferation via metabolic transition from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis. Finally, cardiac type troponin T2 (cTnT)-promoter-driven adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) for Hand1 induction in cardiomyocytes significantly promoted cardiac regeneration and functional recovery. These findings may provide novel molecular strategies to promote heart regeneration and therapeutic interventions for heart failure.},

  abstract     = {Doxorubicin, an anthracycline commonly used for treating cancer patients, is known for its cardiotoxic side-effects. Although dose-dependent, but susceptibility remains variable among patients, and childhood-exposure-adult-onset remains challenging. Besides topoisomerase toxicity, Doxorubicin is also toxic to the mitochondria yet the underlying late onset mechanism remains elusive. Here, it is observed that the mitochondrial copy number in PBMCs of patients treated with anthracycline chemotherapy is negatively correlated with the change in plasma BNP levels after treatment. Isogenic hiPSC-CMs are generated with high, norm, and low mitochondrial copy numbers using mitochondrial transplantation and the YFP-Parkin system. Remarkably, lower mitochondria copy number translates to lower IC 50 , suggesting increased susceptibility. Mitochondria supplementation by intramyocardial injection prevents doxorubicin induced heart failure. Mechanistically, doxorubicin treatment leads to mPTP opening and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. This mtDNA leakage event activates the cGAS-STING pathway and drives inflammation and myocardial senescence. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of Sting (Myh6-Cre/Sting flox/flox ; Sting CKO ) and over expression of mitochondrial tagged DNase1 in mice partially rescue doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction. In conclusion, the work establishes a negative correlation between cardiomyocyte mitochondrial copy number and doxorubicin toxicity. Molecularly, it is demonstrated that mtDNA leakage activates cGAS-STING pathway and accelerates myocardial dysfunction. These insights offer new co-administration strategies for cancer patients.},

Although several key plasmid elements that balance mcr-1 persistence and bacterial growth are identified, the regulatory interactions between mcr-1 and host bacteria remain poorly understood. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi crRNA library, it is identified that DNA polymerase IV, dinB , is essential for controlling the fitness cost associated with mcr-1 in Escherichia coli . The absence of dinB operon enhances mcr-1 -mediated colistin resistance but simultaneously compromises bacterial growth and competitiveness. Meanwhile, dinB deficiency mitigates inflammatory response in RAW267.4 cells and enhances bacterial colonization in murine tissues. Further investigation reveals that mcr-1 actively upregulates dinB expression, with the increased reactive oxygen species induced by mcr-1 being crucial for this activation.   These findings suggest that dinB modulates mcr expression and bacterial fitness via a negative feedback regulatory mechanism. Leveraging this regulatory relationship, a Toxin-Intein is engineered under the control of dinB promoter to selectively target and kill mcr -positive E. coli both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the work uncovers a novel adaptive mechanism underlying mcr persistence and provides a precise antimicrobial strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Metastasis remains a significant challenge in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of ribonuclease T2 (RNASET2) in HCC is still uncertain, although it has been reported to have contradictory effects on some cancers. Here, it is demonstrated that RNASET2 knockout leads to significant accumulation of cholesterol, which in turn promotes MET-mediated HCC metastasis. Mechanistically, the absence of RNASET2 hinders the degradation of RNA into uridine, thereby reducing the conversion to UTP. This reduction restrains glucuronate metabolism and the expression of the related enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1, ultimately resulting in the accumulation of cholesterol due to decreased formation of glucuronidated-bile acids. The administration of cholesterol induces the migration and invasion of HCC cells through MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) activation. However, the deficiency of RNASET2-induced HCC metastasis can be reversed by blocking MET with shRNA or savolitinib. The study identifies RNASET2 as a key regulator that coordinates RNA, glucuronate, and cholesterol metabolism. Its deficiency drives HCC metastasis through cholesterol-triggered MET activation. These findings highlight the potential of targeting RNASET2 and MET in improving the prognosis of HCC.},

  abstract     = {Targeting cholesterol metabolism is a novel direction for tumor therapy. Unfortunately, the current use of statins for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Herein, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) is identified as a novel target for treating HCC and a potential alternative to statins. Twenty-three key genes in cholesterol biosynthesis are screened, and FDFT1 is identified via public databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, International Cancer Genome Consortium and Gene Expression Omnibus). Clinical samples reveal that FDFT1 is highly expressed in HCC tissues, and this phenotype is strongly associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally, FDFT1 knockdown inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells and suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo, whereas FDFT1 overexpression promotes HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, FDFT1 downregulation decreases cholesterol and bile acid levels and then increases hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) transcriptional activity. Experiments indicate that HNF4A combines with the promoter of aldolase B ( ALDOB) and promotes the ALDOB transcription and that ALDOB combines with AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1) and inhibits AKT1 phosphorylation. Moreover, FDFT1 knockdown combined with AKT inhibitor (AZD5363) treatment shows remarkable therapeutic potential. FDFT1 inhibition reduces cholesterol and bile acid levels to delay HCC progression through the HNF4A/ALDOB/AKT1 axis. Thus, targeting FDFT1 may be a novel potential strategy for treating HCC.},

These molecules are prevalent in eukaryotes and play key roles in cancer. Here, the function of a new circRNA, circMETTL6, in ovarian cancer is identified and investigated. The prognostic significance of circMETTL6 is assessed using RNA in situ hybridization. Functional studies involving circMETTL6 overexpression are performed both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations are performed using RNA-seq, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, protein degradation assay and dual-luciferase reporter assays. circMETTL6 is significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer, and its lower expression correlates with worse prognosis. Overexpression of circMETTL6 significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovarian cancer cell in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, circMETTL6 recruited the non-POU domain containing octamer binding protein (NONO) by binding to its Coiled-coil domain and disrupted its binding with RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A), and consequently inhibiting growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) transcription, thereby suppressing ovarian cancer progression.

  abstract     = {Malonic acid (MA) is a high-value-added chemical with significant applications in the polymers, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Microbial production of MA presents enzyme inefficiencies, competitive metabolic pathways, and dispersive carbon flux, which collectively limit its biosynthesis. Here, the non-conventional oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is genetically engineered to enhance MA production. Initially, the malonyl-CoA pathway, comprising a malonyl-CoA hydrolase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is confirmed as the most efficient for MA production in Y. lipolytica . To further enhance MA production, two novel malonyl-CoA hydrolases exhibiting higher activity than the hydrolase from S. cerevisiae , are identified from Y. lipolytica and Fusarium oxysporum , respectively. The introduction of the malonyl-CoA hydrolase from F. oxysporum increases the MA titer to 6.3 g L −1 . Subsequently, advanced metabolic engineering strategies are performed to ensure a sufficient flux of the precursors acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA for MA production, resulting in a production of 13.8 g L −1 MA in shaking-flasks. Finally, by employing the fermentation conditions and feeding strategies, a maximum concentration of 63.6 g L −1 of MA is achieved at 156 h with a productivity of 0.41 g L −1 h −1 in fed-batch fermentation. This study provides a new way for engineering Y. lipolytica to enhance MA production at high titer.},

The key challenge resides in the development of efficient sensing systems with high sensitivity, selectivity, humidity resistance, and profuse color change. Herein, a strategy is reported for the direct visualization of VOCs sensing by mimicking human olfactory function and integrating colorimetric COF-on-MOF sensors with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted data analysis techniques. The Dye@Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework@Covalent Organic Framework (Dye@ZIF-8@COF) sensor takes advantage of the highly porous structure of MOF core and hydrophobic nature of the COF shell, enabling highly sensitive colorimetric sensing of trace number of VOCs. The Dye@ZIF-8@COF sensor exhibits exceptional sensitivity to VOCs at sub-parts per million levels and demonstrates excellent humidity resistance (under 20–90% relative humidity), showing great promise for practical applications. Importantly, AI-assisted information fusion and perceptual analysis greatly promote the accuracy of the VOCs sensing processes, enabling direct visualization and classification of seven stages of matcha drying processes with a superior accuracy of 95.74%. This work paves the way for the direct visualization of sensing processes of VOCs via the integration of advanced humidity-resistant sensing materials and AI-assisted data analyzing techniques.},

However, the focus on continuously improving the joint motors and control systems of existing legged robots not only increases costs and complicates maintenance but also results in failure to accurately mimic the functionality of the human skeletal‒muscular system. This study introduces a bionic legged robot structure that leverages the tensegrity principle, drawing inspiration from the human leg&#39;s structural morphology and kinematic mechanisms. By designing a system that distinguishes between rolling and sliding movements, the human knee&#39;s variable instantaneous center of rotation (ICR), is successfully replicated showcasing its capabilities in achieving gait resemblance and vibration absorption. The tensegrity unit&#39;s features, including remarkable deformability, self-recovery, and the four-bar mechanism&#39;s singular position characteristic, alongside a rope unlocking mechanism reminiscent of human muscles, facilitate in situ compliance–rigid–compliance transitions of the knee joint without the need for knee joint motors, relying solely on ground contact through the foot. This innovation overcomes the conventional dependency of legged robots on joint motors, as the system requires only a single DC motor positioned at the hip joint and a straightforward control program to seamlessly execute a complete cycle of a single leg&#39;s movement.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with oxidative stress and redox signaling disruption. It is recently reported that proautophagic autophagy/beclin-1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1) is a positive modulator of the NF-κB pathway that promotes intestinal inflammation. However, its effect on intestinal redox state and whether AMBRA1 is regulated by oxidative stress remain unknown. In this study, it is found that AMBRA1 functions as a pro-oxidative factor that increases oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the N-terminal F1 domain is required for AMBRA1 to competitively interact with the N-terminal domain of NRF2, thereby antagonizing the interaction between deubiquitinating protein 3 (DUB3) and NRF2, suppressing DUB3-mediated NRF2 deubiquitination, and leading to NRF2 degradation. In response to H 2 O 2 stimulation, the interaction between AMBRA1 and ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is enhanced, facilitating USP7 to deubiquitinate AMBRA1 at K83 and K86 and stabilize AMBRA1. Notably, the USP7 inhibitor, P5091, inhibits oxidative stress and colitis in vivo. Elevated AMBRA1 expression in inflamed colon tissues from ulcerative colitis patients is negatively correlated with decreased NRF2 protein levels. Overall, this study identifies AMBRA1 as a pro-oxidative factor in IECs and provides a redox-modulating therapeutic strategy for targeting USP7/AMBRA1 in IBD.},

  abstract     = {A major characteristic of ovarian cancer (OC) is its unique route of metastasis via ascites. The immune microenvironment in ascites remains understudied, leaving the mechanism of ascites-mediated abdominal metastasis obscure. Here, a single-cell transcriptomic landscape of CD45 + immune cells across multiple anatomical sites is depicted, including primary tumors, metastatic lesions, and ascites, from patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). A novel subset of perilipin 2 high (PLIN2 hi ) macrophages are identified that are enriched in ascites and positively correlated with OC progression, hence being designated as “ascites-associated macrophages (AAMs)”. AAMs are lipid-loaded with overexpression of the lipid droplet protein PLIN2. Overexpression or suppression of PLIN2 can enhance or inhibit tumor cell migration, invasion, and vascular permeability in vitro, which is also confirmed in vivo. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that PLIN2 boosts HIF1α/SPP1 signaling in macrophages, thereby exerting pro-tumor functions. Finally, a PLIN2-targeting liposome is designed to efficiently suppress ascites production and tumor metastasis. Taken together, this work provides a comprehensive characterization of the cancer-promoting function and lipid-rich property of ascites-enriched PLIN2 hi macrophages, establishes a link between lipid metabolism and hypoxia within the context of the ascites microenvironment, and elucidates the pivotal role of ascites in trans-coelomic metastasis of OC.},

This process aligns the oxide grains with their easy-magnetization c -axis parallel to the applied magnetic field. Depending on the magnetic field&#39;s direction relative to the slip casting, grains orient either with their a , b -plane or c -axis parallel to the normal direction of the disk-shaped ceramic, thus aligning with the oxygen permeation direction. Without the magnetic field, a non-textured bulk membrane is formed. The microstructure and texture of the ceramic membranes are meticulously analyzed using advanced techniques, including X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as related methods. Evaluation of the texturing effect on the oxygen permeation performance shows that the a , b -plane textured Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ bulk membrane achieves the highest oxygen permeation fluxes between 1023–1223 K. Additionally, it demonstrates impressive CO₂ stability, maintaining effective performance for at least 140 h due to preferential oxygen transport along the a , b -plane. These characteristics make Nd 2 NiO 4+ δ an auspicious material for industrial applications as an oxygen transport membrane, outperforming more susceptible perovskite-based materials. Magnetic alignment thus proves to be an effective method for achieving membrane texturing, enabling precise regulation of oxygen transport properties.},

Here, an amphiphilic microparticle with four discrete hydrophilic patches embedded at the inner corners of a square-shaped hydrophobic outer ring of the particle (4C particle) is fabricated. Three dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations predict droplet formation dynamics and differing equilibrium conditions depending on the patterning configuration. Experiments recapitulate equilibrium conditions, enabling tunable dropicle configurations with reproducible volumes down to ≈200 pL templated by the amphiphilic particles. The dropicle configurations depend predominantly on the size of the hydrophilic patches of the 4C particles. This validates that the modeling approach can inform the design of dropicles with varying volumes and numbers per particle, which can be harnessed in new amplified bioassays for greater sensitivity, dynamic range, and statistical confidence.},

Herein, it is shown that aging-associated reduction of commensal Parabacteroides goldsteinii ( P. goldsteinii ) in both aged mice and humans critically contributes to worse outcomes of bacterial infection. The colonization of live P. goldsteinii conferred protection against aging-associated bacterial infections. Metabolomic profiling reveals a protective compound, apigenin, generated by P. goldsteinii , antagonizes bacterial clearance defects in aged mice. AMP-binding protein ( ampB ) is identified as a key gene involved in apigenin synthesis in P. goldsteinii using homologous recombination in bacteria. Mechanistically, apigenin binds directly to the potential sites on Fgr (M341 and D404), preventing its inhibitory role on Vav1 phosphorylation, and therefore promoting the activation of Cdc42/Rac1, Arp2/3 expression and subsequent actin reorganization, which contributes to the enhanced phagocytosis of macrophages to bacteria. Collectively, the findings suggest that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may impair host defense mechanisms and increase susceptibility to bacterial infections in older adults and highlight the microbiota-apigenin-Fgr axis as a possible route to ameliorate aging-associated antibacterial defects.},

The cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, involving cGAMP synthase (cGAS) and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), has emerged as a key mediator of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise mechanisms through which cGAS activation influences AD progression remain poorly understood. In this study, we observed significant up-regulation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway in AD. Notably, this increase is primarily attributed to microglia, rather than non-microglial cell types. Using an inducible, microglia-specific cGAS knockout mouse model in the 5xFAD background, we demonstrated that deleting microglial cGAS at the onset of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology profoundly restricts plaque accumulation and protects mice from Aβ-induced cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, our study revealed cGAS promotes plaque-associated microglia accumulation and is essential for inflammasome activation. Moreover, we showed that restricting cGAS-mediated innate immunity is crucial for preserving inter-cellular communication in the brain and induces pleiotrophin, a neuroprotective factor. These findings offer novel insights into the specific roles of the innate immune system in AD employing a cell-type-specific approach. The conclusions provide a foundation for targeted interventions to modulate the microglial cGAS-STING signaling pathway, offering promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.},

  abstract     = {Suppressing the non-radiative loss in the organic solar cells (OSCs) through molecular design remains a significant challenge. Typically, triplet state of organic semiconductors is lower than the charge transfer (CT) state, contributing to substantial non-radiative loss via the triplet state. Herein, a set of terpolymers is prepared by introducing a simple Pt complex block into the PM6 polymer backbone. These metalated terpolymers exhibit high triplet energy ( E T1 ) and small singlet–triplet energy gap (∆ E ST ), facilitating fast intersystem crossing (ISC) process to generate triplet excitons. Consequently, the metalated terpolymers show enhanced exciton lifetime and diffusion length, and most importantly, effectively suppress the non-radiative recombination via terminal triplet loss channels. Moreover, the Pt complex modifies the molecular aggregation of the polymer, hence optimizing the morphology of the active blends. The PM6-Pt1:L8-BO devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.54% (certified as 18.32%), the highest reported for metalated terpolymers to date. The PCE is further increased to a record high 19.24% in the PM6-Pt1:PM6:L8-BO (0.8:0.2:1.2, wt/wt/wt) ternary devices. Overall, this work provides a feasible approach to designing terpolymers with high E T1 , thereby reducing non-radiative loss in the OSCs.},

  abstract     = {The accurate assembly of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is fundamental for the replication and transcription of rhabdoviruses, which are known for their broad pathogenic impact. A novel 119-amino-acid protein, NLRP12-119aa is identified, encoded by the circular RNA circNLRP12, that effectively disrupts the formation of rhabdovirus RNP complexes through two distinct mechanisms and significantly reduces their replication. NLRP12-119aa exhibits a strong affinity for the conserved 18-nucleotide sequence at the start of the leader RNA of rhabdoviruses VSV, SCRV, and RABV, outcompeting their native N protein interactions, thereby disrupting the assembly of RNP complexes and inhibiting viral replication. NLRP12-119aa exerts anti-rhabdoviral effects by directly binding to the viral N protein, leading to its destabilization and accelerated degradation, and consequently hindering the formation of the viral RNP complex. To assess the therapeutic potential of circNLRP12 against rhabdovirus infections, a zebrafish model of VSV infection is established and noted a substantial reduction in viral load after-treatment with circNLRP12, as well as the recovery of spleen&#39;s to a normalized state from its previously enlarged and hemorrhagic state. Collectively, these findings elucidate a novel dual anti-RNP assembly strategy mediated by NLRP12-119aa, offering valuable insights for further exploration and clinical management of rhabdoviral infections.},

  abstract     = {Particle-stabilized emulsions, also known as Pickering emulsions, have shown promise in areas that require long-term stability with minimum use of surfactants. While most work has focused on densely covered Pickering emulsions, such emulsions are known to retain stability even when the interfaces are sparsely covered with particles. Here, the formation, dynamics, and stability of poorly covered model Pickering emulsions are studied in a controlled manner by utilizing a microfluidic platform. The formed Pickering emulsions remain highly stable, over at least 12 h, even with a surface area coverage below 3%. By directly visualizing the droplet interface at various stages, the exceptional stability is attributed to the highly spatially heterogeneous distribution of adsorbed particles which exclusively form particle bridges at the contact point between the droplets. Remarkably, these bridges are assembled in the form of crowns between the droplet interfaces, as visualized by confocal microscopy. The assembly behavior of the adsorbed particles in response to hydrodynamic forces and the formation of non-uniform particle distribution are discussed by analyzing the different forces present during emulsification, corroborated by numerical simulations. In conclusion, using a lab-on-a-chip approach, this work provides further understanding toward the fabrication of Pickering emulsions via preferential interfacial localization of particles.},

  abstract     = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a prevalent bone marrow disorder. The challenges in managing MM include selecting chemotherapy regimens that effectively modulate the myeloma microenvironment and delivering them to the bone marrow with high efficacy and minimal toxicity. Herein, a novel bone marrow targeting strategy using c(RGDfk) peptide-modified liposomes loaded with chemotherapeutics is developed, which can specifically recognize and hitchhike neutrophils following systemic administration, capitalizing on their natural aging process to facilitate precise drug delivery to the bone marrow, thus minimizing off-target effects. On the one hand, c(RGDfk)-functionalized liposomes containing carfilzomib (CRLPs) successfully transformed macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype, enhancing immunotherapeutic responses. On the other hand, c(RGDfk)-functionalized liposomes encapsulating BMS-202 (BRLPs), a small molecule checkpoint inhibitor, interrupted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and promoted the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. The co-administration of CRLPs and BRLPs successfully delivered drugs to bone marrow, leading to significant modulation of the myeloma microenvironment, reduced tumor growth, and improved survival time of MM-bearing mouse models. These findings introduced an alternative approach to modulating the myeloma microenvironment and underscored the efficacy of hitchhiking neutrophils for bone marrow drug delivery. This strategy show advantages over traditional drug delivery methods in terms of improved efficacy and lowered toxicity.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is a promising anti-tumor therapeutic strategy; however, its efficacy in solid tumors is limited. Chromosome missegregation is common in various solid tumors; however, its role in tumor progression remains poorly understood, and its correlation with ICI is yet to be explored. Here, it is found that increased chromosome missegregation promotes tumor immune microenvironment, and eventually immunotherapeutic efficacy, by triggering pyroptosis. yin yang 2 (YY2) is identified as a mitotic checkpoint regulator, which promotes chromosome missegregation by upregulating BUB1B transcription. Increased chromosome missegregation promoted the formation of micronuclei and release of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into the cytosol, triggering an AIM2-mediated cytosolic dsDNA response. The subsequent pyroptosis strengthened the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing immunoinfiltration and cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells, while preventing their exhaustion. Finally, through in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that combining YY2 overexpression-induced chromosome missegregation/cytosolic dsDNA response and PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced the efficacy of ICI immunotherapy in microsatellite instable and microsatellite stable colorectal cancer cells. Together, these findings provide new insights on the role of chromosome missegregation in triggering cytosolic dsDNA response-mediated pyroptosis and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, suggesting a novel strategy for improving ICI therapeutic efficacy in colorectal cancer.},

  abstract     = {Acute severe autoimmune hepatitis (AS-AIH) is characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis, with a current lack of effective targeted treatments. Stem cell therapy has demonstrated significant therapeutic promise across various autoimmune diseases. However, the intricate pathogenesis of AS-AIH has hindered the widespread utilization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in this domain. Herein, it is demonstrated that necroptosis, as the primary mode of cell death in AIH, is crucial in causing AS-AIH. Inflammatory macrophages are the primary cell population involved in necroptosis. Inhibition of the specificity protein 1/sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine-1-phosphate (SP1/SK1/S1P) axis is responsible for this phenomenon, leading to excessive activation of the intrahepatic immune system and aggravating liver damage. Furthermore, the S1P/S1PR2/YAP axis is the key pathway in initiating liver regeneration during AS-AIH. S1P synthesized by hepatocytes is the primary source, and this process is also regulated by the SP1/SK1 axis. MSCs promote S1P synthesis by macrophages through the delivery of SP1, which inhibits necroptosis and synergistically enhances liver regeneration. In addition, MSCs also promote S1P synthesis in hepatocytes through the same mechanism, further aiding liver regeneration. These findings unveil the core pathogenesis of AS-AIH and provide a theoretical foundation for using MSCs as a potential targeted therapeutic modality.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly resistant to ferroptosis, which hinders the application of anti-ferroptosis therapy. Through drug screening, it is found that histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) significantly sensitized CRC to ferroptosis. The combination of HDACi and ferroptosis inducers synergically suppresses CRC growth both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, HDACi reduces ferroptosis suppressor protein (FSP1) by promoting its mRNA degradation. Specifically, it is confirmed that HDACi specifically targets HDAC1 and promotes the H3K27ac modification of fat mass- and obesity-associated gene (FTO) and AlkB Homolog 5, RNA Demethylase (ALKBH5), which results in significant activation of FTO and ALKBH5. The activation of FTO and ALKBH5 reduces N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification on FSP1 mRNA, leading to its degradation. Crucially, lactylation of HDAC1 K412 is essential for ferroptosis regulation. Both Vorinostat (SAHA) and Trichostatin A (TSA) notably diminish HDAC1 K412 lactylation in comparison to other HDAC1 inhibitors, exhibiting a consistent trend of increasing susceptibility to ferroptosis. In conclusion, the research reveals that HDACi decreases HDAC1 K412 lactylation to sensitize CRC to ferroptosis and that the combination of HDACi and ferroptosis inducers can be a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC.},

However, there is a need to develop multiplexed assays capable of analyzing multiple genes simultaneously to expand its application. To address this, a multiplexed RT-qPCR using a double emulsion (DE)-based carrier and a polymer microparticle reactor, termed primer-incorporated network tailored with Taqman probe (TaqPIN) is developed. The DE securely stores nucleic acid reagents like primers and probes within the polymer network until heating releases them for the reaction. The TaqPIN RT-qPCR demonstrates an amplification efficiency of 93.8% and can detect as few as 20 copies/µL. By loading the multiple microparticles into a single reaction, a multiplexed assay with only one optical channel is enabled. In practice, a nine-plex assay is designed to distinguish between variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Even subtle variations of a single nucleotide can be simultaneously detected. Testing on 75 nasopharyngeal swab samples yields 100% sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection and 94% accuracy in variant discrimination.},

  abstract     = {The immunosuppressive microenvironment in pancreatic cancer, characterized by low tumor-specific T cells and excessive fibrosis, limits the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Here, three datasets and multi-immunofluorescence staining of tissue microarrays in pancreatic cancer indicate that mesothelin (MSLN) expression negatively correlates with cytotoxic T cells in tumor. Anti-MSLN antibody ( α MSLN) treatment of pancreatic cancer in vivo can significantly increase T cell infiltration. Meanwhile, the combination of α MSLN and neoantigen peptide vaccine identified from pancreatic cancer cell lines is demonstrated to be more effective in inducing neoantigen-specific T cell generation and infiltration at subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models for enhancing antitumor efficacy. Single-cell transcriptome analysis shows that the combined treatment significantly reduces the proportion of fibroblasts, improves the infiltration of IFN- γ + CD4 + and GZMK + CD8 + T cells, as well as reduces the interaction of antigen presentation-associated ligands and receptors between antigen-presenting Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (apCAFs) and naive CD4 + T cells. The negative correlations between apCAFs and CD8 + T cells/IFN- γ + CD4 + T cells are further confirmed in human pancreatic cancer tissues. Overall, this study demonstrates that targeting MSLN can improve neoantigen vaccine induced immune efficacy by reducing apCAFs to interrupt the conversion of naive CD4 + T cells to Tregs, and therefore increase the infiltration of tumor-specific T cells.},

Targeting CD47 reduced tumor growth, suggesting improved cancer cell sensitization to the immune system post-ICP editing. The study positions LNPs as a robust tool for in vivo validation of ICPs as therapeutic targets in clinically relevant GBM models.

  abstract     = {Re-epithelialization constitutes a critical stage in the intricate process of wound healing, yet its mechanisms in the context of diabetic wounds remain elusive. In this study, the role of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) vis-à-vis the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of keratinocytes in diabetic wound re-epithelialization is investigated. The findings reveal an impediment in the MET process, rather than EMT, which significantly compromised re-epithelialization in diabetic wounds. Furthermore, Desmoplakin ( DSP ) gene expression, encoding a key desmosome protein, is down-regulated in diabetic rats. This down-regulation coincided with aberrant hypo-demethylation of the DSP promoter. The inhibition of DSP expression is linked to reduced occupancy of Ten-eleven translocation 3 (TET3) at the DSP promoter, consequently suppressing TET3-dependent DNA demethylation. Additionally, a novel lncRNA termed DSP-AS1is identified, which is antisense to DSP . Notably, DSP-AS1 expression is down-regulated in diabetic skin wounds, and it interacted with TET3, a DNA demethylase. Notably, DSP-AS1 is found to form R-loops, triple-stranded DNA:RNA hybrids, at the DSP promoter, facilitating TET3 localization to the DSP promoter. Collectively, the findings suggest that reduced R-loop formation by DSP-AS1 impairs DSP gene transcription by repressing TET3-mediated DNA demethylation. This disruption of the orchestrated re-epithelialization process contributes to refractory diabetic wound healing.},

  abstract     = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. UC treatments are limited by significant adverse effects associated with non-specific drug delivery, such as systematic inhibition of the host immune system. Endoscopic delivery of a synthetic hydrogel material with biocompatible gelation that can efficiently cover irregular tissue surfaces provides an effective approach for targeted drug delivery at the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. An ideal integration of synthetic material with intestinal epithelium entails an integrated and preferable chemically bonded interface between the hydrogel and mucosal surface. In this study, a photo-triggered coupling reaction is leveraged as the crosslinking platform to develop a mucosal-adhesive hydrogel, which is compatible with endoscope-directed drug delivery for UC treatment. The results demonstrated superior spatiotemporal specificity and drug pharmacokinetics with this delivery system in vivo. Delivery of different drugs with the hydrogel leads to greatly enhanced therapeutic efficacy and significantly reduced systemic drug exposure with rat colitis models. The study presents a strategy for targeted and persistent drug delivery for UC treatment.},

  abstract     = {The patch clamp technique is a fundamental tool for investigating ion channel dynamics and electrophysiological properties. This study proposes the first artificial intelligence framework for characterizing multiple ion channel kinetics of whole-cell recordings. The framework integrates machine learning for anomaly detection and deep learning for multi-class classification. The anomaly detection excludes recordings that are incompatible with ion channel behavior. The multi-class classification combined a 1D convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention mechanism to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of the recordings. The framework achieves an accuracy of 97.58% in classifying 124 test datasets into six categories based on ion channel kinetics. The utility of the novel framework is demonstrated in two applications: Alzheimer&#39;s disease drug screening and nanomatrix-induced neuronal differentiation. In drug screening, the framework illustrates the inhibitory effects of memantine on endogenous channels, and antagonistic interactions among potassium, magnesium, and calcium ion channels. For nanomatrix-induced differentiation, the classifier indicates the effects of differentiation conditions on sodium and potassium channels associated with action potentials, validating the functional properties of differentiated neurons for Parkinson&#39;s disease treatment. The proposed framework is promising for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of ion channel kinetics analysis in electrophysiological research.},

  abstract     = {Current understanding of micropapillary (MP)-subtype lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains confined to biological activities and genomic landscapes. Unraveling the major regulatory programs underlying MP patterned malignancy offers opportunities to identify more feasible therapeutic targets for patients with MP LUAD. This study shows that patients with MP subtype LUAD have aberrant activation of the MYC pathway compared to patients with other subtypes. In vitro and xenograft mouse model studies reveal that MP pattern in malignancy cannot be solely due to aberrant MYC expression but requires the involvement of M2-like macrophages. Excessively expressed MYC leads to the accumulation of M2-like macrophages from the bone marrow, which secretes TGFβ, to induce the expression of FOSL2 in tumor cells, thereby remodeling chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of MP-pattern genes to promote the MYC-mediated de novo transcriptional regulation of these genes. Additionally, the MP-pattern in malignancy can be effectively alleviated by disrupting the TGFβ-FOSL2 axis. These findings reveal new functions for the M2-like macrophage-TGFβ-FOSL2 axis in MYC-overexpressing MP-subtype LUAD, identifying targetable vulnerabilities in this pathway.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, targeting programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), has exhibited amazing clinical outcomes in various types of cancers. However, only a small portion of patients benefit from ICB therapy, indicating that the mechanism underlying immune checkpoint is still unclear. Here, it is reported that motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1 (MNX1), a homeobox domain-containing transcription factor, contributes to the tumor immune escape. MNX1 increases PD-L1 expression in cancer cells by stabilizing PD-L1 mRNA rather than activating transcription. Mechanistically, MNX1 exists in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and interacts with Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), a multifunctional DNA/RNA-binding protein, to enhance the binding of YBX1 to PD-L1 mRNA. MNX1 ablation activates cytotoxic T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and sensitizes CTLA-4 blockade therapy. Moreover, MNX1 also facilitates tumor progression in an immune-independent manner in cancer cells. In addition, MNX1 is upregulated by its adjacent long non-coding RNA MNX1-AS1 via HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (HERC2). Together, these results reveal MNX1 as a novel immune checkpoint regulator with promising therapeutic potential.},

  abstract     = {Despite an extensive body of literature on trust in technology, designing trustworthy AI systems for high-stakes decision domains remains a significant challenge. Widely used system design guidelines and tools are rarely attuned to domain-specific trustworthiness principles. In this study, we introduce a design framework to address this gap within intelligence analytic tasks, called the Principles-based Approach for Designing Trustworthy, Human-centered AI using the MAST Methodology (PADTHAI-MM). PADTHAI-MM builds on the Multisource AI Scorecard Table (MAST), an AI decision support system evaluation tool designed in accordance to the U.S. Intelligence Community&#39;s standards for system trustworthiness. We demonstrate PADTHAI-MM in our development of the Reporting Assistant for Defense and Intelligence Tasks (READIT), a research platform that leverages data visualizations and natural language processing-based text analysis to emulate AI-enabled intelligence reporting aids. To empirically assess the efficacy of PADTHAI-MM, we developed two versions of READIT for comparison: a “High-MAST” version, which incorporates AI contextual information and explanations, and a “Low-MAST” version, designed to be akin to inscrutable “black box” AI systems. Through an iterative design process guided by stakeholder feedback, our multidisciplinary design team developed prototypes that were evaluated by experienced intelligence analysts. Results substantially supported the viability of PADTHAI-MM in designing for system trustworthiness in this task domain. We also explored the relationship between analysts&#39; MAST ratings and three theoretical categories of information known to impact trust: process , purpose , and performance . Overall, our study supports the practical and theoretical viability of PADTHAI-MM as an approach to designing trustable AI systems.},

However, due to bottlenecks in data, computation, and trust, the sustainability of this strategy is a serious concern. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue in a parsimonious manner (i.e., achieving greater potential with simpler models). The key is to drive models using domain-specific knowledge, such as symbols, logic, and formulas, instead of purely relying on scaleup. This approach allows us to build a framework that uses this knowledge as “building blocks” to achieve parsimony in model design, training, and interpretation. Empirical results show that our methods surpass those that typically follow the scaling law. We also demonstrate our framework in AI for science, specifically in the problem of drug-drug interaction prediction. We hope our research can foster more diverse technical roadmaps in the era of foundation models.},

Incorporating wearable technology with sweat rate sensors allows individuals to conveniently monitor their health, optimize workouts, and enhance occupational safety. However, challenges persist in such integration techniques, including intricate manufacturing, nonlinear responses to changes in sweat rates, and errors from the intermediate measurement of the distance sweat travels in the sensor. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive wearable platform that includes a fully printed, flexible sensor patch, readout electronics, and a mobile app for continuous, real-time monitoring of sweat rate. We fabricate a sensor patch with an area of 700 mm 2 and a weight of 380 mg by utilizing direct 3D printing and scalable microfluidic fabrication. The microfluidic channels are 850 μm wide and 164 μm thick, with serpentine electrodes measuring sweat rate using capacitance. The custom readout electronics capture these changes in capacitance to accurately measure sweat rate, achieving a sensitivity of 0.01 μL min −1 . The sensor&#39;s performance is validated against analytical models, simulations, and on-body trials with commercial sensors. This cost-effective, flexible, and fully integrated sweat-sensing solution has significant potential in precision health.},

In this work, we develop a wristband that integrates an array of 10 skin-conformal strain sensors based on laser-induced graphene, which is optimized for continuous measurement of skin strain. The device is characterized to identify several hand gestures and tasks while simultaneously using an optical camera-based hand-tracking system to estimate the joint locations for ground truth generation. Machine learning models are developed to predict gestures as well as specific hand joint angles with high accuracy of &gt;90% and &gt;95%, respectively. The findings show that the sensors placed closer to actuation-specific anatomical features contribute more toward the high accuracy. The sensor array is also integrated with a wearable readout system that wirelessly transmits the data in real time in order to control a robotic arm as a proof of concept for human–robot interaction applications. The developed skin-conformal device is expected to find wide applications in rehabilitation, sports sciences, and human–computer interaction, paving the way for low-profile prosthetic and orthotic control systems.},

It is found that the requirable number of analog state is analyzed in about ≈50 states and conductance deviation of each analog state is until ≈5% of original value with nonlinearity of ≈0.142 according to constant programming pulse scheme. With the memristor characteristics enough to mimic synaptic weight to be learnt and infer the Fashion-mnist dataset, the classification accuracy is satisfied as ≈84.36% with the loss of ≈16.8% to original level.

  abstract     = {Controlling soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is complex due to their ubiquitous deformation, prompting the use of reduced model-based controllers to provide sufficient state information for high dynamic response control performance. However, most modeling techniques face computational efficiency and complexity of parameter identification issues. To alleviate this, a paradigm coupling an analytical modeling approach based on pseudo-rigid body modeling and the logarithmic decrement method (PRBM + LDM) for parameter estimation is proposed. Using a soft robot hand test bed, the PRBM + LDM model for a closed-loop position controller is applied and is compared with a simple proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) static shape control of soft continuum robots using deep visual inverse kinematic models. Furthermore, the PRBM + LDM model-based force controller is compared with simple constant pressure grasping control by pinching tasks on low-weight, small objects—a screwdriver, a potato chip, and a brass coin. The PRBM + LDM-based position controller outperforms the simple PID position controller, and the PRBM + LDM-based force controller achieves a higher success rate than the constant pressure grasping control in the pinching tasks. In conclusion, the PRBM + LDM modeling technique proves to be a convenient and efficient way to model the dynamic behavior of soft actuators closely and can be applied to build high-precision position and force controllers.},

The neural networks are trained using 18 000 data points generated from numerical simulations with input powers ranging from sub-kW- to kW-class. The accuracy of the developed machine learning model is demonstrated using untrained 700 W- and 1 kW-class Hall effect ion sources, producing results with deviations of less than 10% compared to the experimentally measured thrust and discharge current, thus surpassing the accuracy of conventional scaling laws. As a high-fidelity surrogate for numerical simulations, the proposed prediction tool provides high prediction accuracy and calculation speed, offering an excellent complement to conventional scaling laws and enhancing the understanding of Hall effect ion source performance characteristics.},

Here, a graphical user interface version of SuperResNET was applied to publicly available direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) data of nucleoporin Nup96 and Nup107 labeled nuclear pores that present a highly organized octagon structure of eight corners. SuperResNET effectively segments nuclear pores and Nup96 corners based on differential proximity threshold analysis from 2D and 3D SMLM datasets. SuperResNET quantitatively analyzes features from segmented nuclear pores, including complete structures with eightfold symmetry, and from segmented corners. SuperResNET modularity analysis of segmented corners from 2D SMLM distinguishes two modules at 10.7 ± 0.1 nm distance, corresponding to two individual Nup96 molecules. SuperResNET is therefore a model-free tool that can reconstruct network architecture and molecular distribution of subcellular structures without the bias of a specified prior model, attaining molecular resolution from dSTORM data. SuperResNET provides flexibility to report on structural diversity in situ within the cell, providing opportunities for biological discovery.},

Developing an accurate and anti-interference control method for photoresponsive LCE actuators remains a significant challenge. Herein, a computer vision-assisted light-driven LCE for accurate control of bending actions of the LCE actuator is proposed. The control system effectively mitigates instability in the bending angle caused by environmental factors such as light, wind, and changes in the surrounding medium. Furthermore, a “lift bridge” for ants moving between two platforms and an oscillator with modulable angular interval and frequency are demonstrated. The proposed system provides a general strategy for accurate and anti-interference control for photoresponsive LCE actuators, which can be extended to complex actions, multifunctions, and multistimuli actuators, showing wide application potential in soft actuators and soft robots.},

To address these challenges, a patient-mounted neuro optical coherence tomography (neuroOCT) system that combines a lightweight 5 degrees-of-freedom skull-mounted robot (Skullbot) with a neuroendoscope measuring ≈0.6 mm in diameter is introduced. This innovative system enables targeted and minimally invasive neuroimaging with an axial resolution of ≈2.4 μm and a transverse resolution of around 4.5 μm. The Skullbot can be securely attached to the head and precisely deploys the neuroendoscope with an accuracy of ±1.5 mm in the transverse direction and ±0.25 mm in the longitudinal direction. This allows for motion-insensitive stereotactic imaging within the brain. By utilizing the neuroOCT system, targeted imaging of a tumor in a brain phantom is successfully demonstrated. Furthermore, the system&#39;s capability for in vivo micro-resolution volumetric neuroimaging of fine structures within a mouse brain is validated.},

  abstract     = {Achieving safe robotic manipulation at the microscopic scale usually requires sophisticated equipment, imposing accessibility difficulty in practice. Inspired by tiny bubbles in nature, a new paradigm is proposed for achieving multifunctional manipulation and sensing using microbubbles for biological application in aqueous environments at low cost. Without demanding the expensive cost of fabrication devices, bubbles with various sizes are easy to generate in situ, which is enabled by bubble-endowed interface interactions. It is demonstrated that bubbles acting as micro end-effectors rapidly and adaptively realize dexterous manipulation of microobjects such as biological organisms and droplets. They can function as microgrippers to grasp microobjects based on interface interaction-induced adhesion and act as soft micromanipulators to safely manipulate fragile objects. Moreover, the bubble micro end-effector can sense and perceive the designated objects for contact measurement of microforces or surface textures at a microscopic scale via the shape changes of their ultrasoft structures. The reported method successfully integrates grasping, manipulation, and measurement functions in liquid using a single microbubble of less than 1 mm 3 volume. These nondestructive functionalities showcase promising prospects for bubble-based micro end-effectors in biological manipulation and sensing applications.},

However, most of the existing methods are single-modal movement recognition, which has inherent limitations, such as limited feature representation and instability to noise, which will affect its practical performance. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel fusion approach that can integrate two biological signals, including electromyography (EMG) and bioelectrical impedance (BI). The fusion method combines EMG for capturing dynamic movement features and BI for discerning key postures representing discrete points within dynamic movements. In this method, the identification of key postures and their temporal sequences provide a guiding framework for the selection and weighted correction of probability prediction matrices in EMG-based dynamic recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the method, six dynamic upper limb movements and nine key postures are defined, and a Universal Robot that can follow movements is employed for experimental validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of the dynamic movement reaches 96.2%, representing an improvement of nearly 10% compared with single-modal signal. This study illustrates the potential of multimodal fusion of EMG and BI in movement recognition, with broad prospects for application in HMI fields.},

Their functionalities span from cell sorting to microscale fiber assembly through periodic acoustic pressure fields. Conventional methods usually require parallel acoustic emitters and reflective surfaces, producing constrained standing wave patterns. In this paper, an effective approach for creating versatile acoustic standing wave fields using an acoustic metasurface deflector and retroreflector is introduced. The deflector manipulates the direction of incoming acoustic waves coupled with the retroreflector to reflect these waves back to the source. The proposed design allows the creation of standing waves that are not constrained by the relative angles of the two surfaces involved and allows for customizable wave patterns beyond the standard limits with enhanced adaptability. The system&#39;s effectiveness is evaluated through computational simulations using finite element analysis and experimental validation based on a 3D-printed prototype. Results suggest that versatile standing waves between arbitrarily oriented surfaces can be produced through the careful design of the metasurface deflector and retroreflector. This approach can improve the performance of standing wave applications in particle manipulation, thus broadening the range of practical implementations for ultrasound and acoustofluidic technologies.},

Herein, a novel fabrication strategy for contactless assembly of soft-robots is introduced for the first time. This technology exploits hydrodynamic instabilities at the free surface of a fluid layer, thus enabling the fabrication of centimeter-scale robots featuring diverse structural properties. These features show a wide range of deformation modes in response to magnetic fields, including folding, bending, and expanding. Furthermore, the design and assembly of novel actuators with customized shapes as fish- and butterfly-like structures is shown. The fabricated patterns exhibit different modes of motion under the influence of uniform magnetic fields. As a proof of concept, an innovative application of this technology combined with the proposed soft robots is represented by the enhanced release of extracellular vesicles.  Altogether, this novel fabrication method along with the newly developed magnetic soft robots enables the manufacturing of high-performance, multifunctional, and cytocompatible intelligent systems.},

To be able to reach a maximum travel distance in one turn of work with a full battery charge, the vehicle should follow the reference route with minimum tracking errors. One of the reasons which prevents a good path tracking is the slippage because slippage causes tracking errors in both longitudinal and lateral directions. Herein, a modeling structure for a mecanum-wheeled autonomous electric vehicle used for the heavy duties in iron–steel industry is proposed by taking the slippage information into account. The objective is to reach more travel distance and reduce the energy loss of the battery which causes to carry load less than planned.

Five tons of zinc ingots are carried from the storage area to the melting pot using an autonomous electric vehicle in a predefined reference route. More than 5 km autonomous drive is performed and the experiments show that slippage causes an energy loss of 6.1786%, which means battery allows 6.1786% less distance than planned travel.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in extended reality (XR) showcase their potential ability to enhance the user experience of traditional displays such as liquid crystal displays and organic light-emitting diode screens. To achieve this goal, the upcoming generation of head-mounted displays (HMDs) necessitates a seamless transition between different XR modes, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) modes. Herein, an innovative cholesteric liquid crystal- (CLC-) based optical combiner for HMDs is introduced. This approach enables the display device to switch between AR, VR, and transparent modes via temperature modulation. Since CLC materials demonstrate varying optical properties at different temperatures, a real-time temperature monitoring system that is paired with an external controller is integrated. This allows for dynamic temperature adjustments of the optical combiner and enables smooth transitions between display modes. Furthermore, the Berreman 4 × 4 matrix method is used to simulate the optical properties of the optical combiner, finding strong agreement with the experimental results. The performance of the tunable optical combiners using 450, 532, and 635 nm laser sources is explored. The findings demonstrate that CLC-based optical combiners can effectively switch between the three distinct modes at corresponding temperatures, paving the way for versatile applications in future HMDs.},

  abstract     = {Grasp generation methods based on force-closure analysis can calculate the optimal grasps for objects through their appearances. However, the limited visual perception ability makes robots difficult to directly detect the complete appearance of objects. Building predefined models is also a costly procedure. These reasons constrain the application of force-closure analysis in the real world. To solve it, this article proposes an interactive robotic grasping method based on promptable segment anything model and force-closure analysis. A human operator can mark a prompt on any object using a laser pointer. Then, the robot extracts the edge of the marked object and calculates the optimal grasp through the edge. To validate feasibility and generalizability, the grasping generation method is tested on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets and a novel benchmark test set of 36 diverse objects is constructed to conduct real-world experiments. Furthermore, the contributions of each step are demonstrated through ablation experiments and the proposed method is tested in the occlusion scenarios.

At this purpose, QPI is implemented in high-throughput flow cytometry mode and combined with machine learning (ML), reliable and accurate OC cell phenotyping is achieved by developing ad-hoc multi-level ML classification architectures driven by a priori clinical information. It is shown that the latter allows increasing the overall classification accuracy when compared to noninformed ML classification systems.

CS-ELM-AE encodes points in the same class of the dataset to be closer together. Oversampling is also applied to the encoded dataset to solve the imbalanced data problem.

In this study, we introduce the methodological framework of a new procedure for performing power analysis when PLS-based methods are used. Data are simulated by the Monte Carlo method, assuming the null hypothesis of no effect is false and exploiting the latent structure estimated by PLS in the pilot data. In this way, the complex correlation data structure is explicitly considered in power analysis and sample size estimation.

Determining if a measure is suitable to use as a surrogate endpoint is a challenging task and a variety of meta-analysis models have been proposed for this purpose. The Daniels and Hughes bivariate model for trial-level surrogate endpoint evaluation is gaining traction but presents difficulties for frequentist estimation and hitherto only Bayesian solutions have been available. This is because the marginal model is not a conventional linear model and the number of unknown parameters increases at the same rate as the number of studies. This second property raises immediate concerns that the maximum likelihood estimator of the model&#39;s unknown variance component may be downwardly biased. We derive maximum likelihood estimating equations to motivate a bias adjusted estimator of this parameter. The bias correction terms in our proposed estimating equation are easily computed and have an intuitively appealing algebraic form. A simulation study is performed to illustrate how this estimator overcomes the difficulties associated with maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate our methods using two contrasting examples from oncology.},

Several methods to determine sample size based on the RMST-based tests have been proposed. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no discussion about the power and sample size regarding the augmented version of RMST-based tests, which utilize baseline covariates for a gain in estimation efficiency and in power for testing no treatment effect. The conventional event-driven study design based on the logrank test allows us to calculate the power for a given hazard ratio without specifying the survival functions. In contrast, the existing sample size determination methods for the RMST-based tests relies on the adequacy of the assumptions of the entire survival curves of two groups. Furthermore, to handle the augmented test, the correlation between the baseline covariates and the martingale residuals must be handled. To address these issues, we propose an approximated sample size formula for the augmented version of the RMST-based test, which does not require specifying the entire survival curve in the treatment group, and also a sample size recalculation approach to update the correlations between the baseline covariates and the martingale residuals with the blinded data. The proposed procedure will enable the studies to have the target power for a given RMST difference even when correct survival functions cannot be specified at the design stage.},

  abstract     = {N-of-1 trials are currently receiving broader attention in healthcare research when assessing the effectiveness of interventions. In contrast to the most commonly applied two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), in an N-of-1 design, the individual acts as their own control condition in the sense of a multiple crossover trial. N-of-1 trials can lead to a higher quality of patient by examining the effectiveness of an intervention at an individual level. Moreover, when a series of N-of-1 trials are properly aggregated, it becomes possible to detect an intervention effect at a population level. This work investigates whether a meta-analysis of summary data of a series of N-of-1 trials allows us to detect a statistically significant intervention effect with fewer participants than in a traditional, prospectively powered two-arm RCT and crossover design when evaluating a digital health intervention in cardiovascular care. After introducing these different analysis approaches, we compared the empirical properties in a simulation study both under the null hypothesis and with respect to power with different between-subject heterogeneity settings and in the presence of a carry-over effect. We further investigate the performance of a sequential aggregation procedure. In terms of simulated power, the threshold of 80% was achieved earlier for the aggregating procedure, requiring fewer participants.},

  abstract     = {The primary goal of this paper is to introduce a novel frailty model based on the weighted Lindley (WL) distribution for modeling clustered survival data. We study the statistical properties of the proposed model. In particular, the amount of unobserved heterogeneity is directly parameterized by the variance of the frailty distribution such as gamma and inverse Gaussian frailty models. Parametric and semiparametric versions of the WL frailty model are studied. A simple expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate its finite sample performance. Finally, we apply the proposed model to a real data set to analyze times after surgery in patients diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma and compare our results with classical frailty models carried out in this application, which shows the superiority of the proposed model. We implement an R package that includes estimation for fitting the proposed model based on the EM algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Statistical methods to study the association between a longitudinal biomarker and the risk of death are very relevant for the long-term care of subjects affected by chronic illnesses, such as potassium in heart failure patients. Particularly in the presence of comorbidities or pharmacological treatments, sudden crises can cause potassium to undergo very abrupt yet transient changes. In the context of the monitoring of potassium, there is a need for a dynamic model that can be used in clinical practice to assess the risk of death related to an observed patient&#39;s potassium trajectory. We considered different landmark survival approaches, starting from the simple approach considering the most recent measurement. We then propose a novel method based on wavelet filtering and landmarking to retrieve the prognostic role of past short-term potassium shifts. We argue that while taking into account the smooth changes in the biomarker, short-term changes cannot be overlooked. State-of-the-art dynamic survival models are prone to give more importance to the smooth component of the potassium profiles. However, our findings suggest that it is essential to also take into account recent potassium instability to capture all the relevant prognostic information. The data used comes from over 2000 subjects, with a total of over 80,000 repeated potassium measurements collected through administrative health records. The proposed wavelet landmark method revealed the prognostic role of past short-term changes in potassium. We also performed a simulation study to assess how and when to apply the proposed wavelet-mixed landmark model.},

Such an issue arises when multiple annotators are tasked to manually label the same training samples, potentially giving rise to discrepancies in class assignments among the supplied labels with respect to the ground truth. Commonly, the labeling process is entrusted to a small group of domain experts, and different level of experience and subjectivity may result in noisy training labels. To solve the classification task leveraging on the availability of multiple data annotators, we introduce a novel ensemble methodology constructed combining model-based classifiers separately trained on single sets of noisy labels. Eigenvalue Decomposition Discriminant Analysis is employed for the definition of the base learners, and six distinct averaging strategies are proposed to combine them. Two solutions necessitate a priori information, such as the partial knowledge of the ground truth labels or the annotators&#39; level of expertise. Differently, the remaining four approaches are entirely data-driven. A simulation study and an application on real data showcase the improved predictive performance of our proposal, while also demonstrating the ability of automatically inferring annotators&#39; expertise level as a by-product of the learning process.},

These settings are often modeled with illness-death models for the hazards of the terminal and nonterminal events, but evaluating causal treatment effects with hazard models is problematic due to conditioning on survival—a posttreatment outcome—that is embedded in the definition of a hazard. Extending an existing survivor average causal effect (SACE) estimand, we frame the evaluation of treatment effects in the context of semicompeting risks with principal stratification and introduce two new causal estimands: the time-varying survivor average causal effect (TV-SACE) and the restricted mean survivor average causal effect (RM-SACE). These principal causal effects are defined among units that would survive regardless of assigned treatment. We adopt a Bayesian estimation procedure that parameterizes illness-death models for both treatment arms. We outline a frailty specification that can accommodate within-person correlation between nonterminal and terminal event times, and we discuss potential avenues for adding model flexibility. The method is demonstrated in the context of hospital readmission among late-stage pancreatic cancer patients.},

This kind of technology offers a detailed understanding of the role of several molecular factors in biological systems. For this reason, the development of fast and efficient computational methods that can extract relevant signals from massive experiments has become necessary. A key goal in mass spectrometry data analysis is the identification of molecules with similar functions in the analyzed biological system. This result can be achieved by studying the spatial distribution of the molecules&#39; abundance patterns. To do so, one can perform coclustering, that is, dividing the molecules into groups according to their expression patterns over the tissue and segmenting the tissue according to the molecules&#39; abundance levels. We present TRIFASE, a semi-nonnegative matrix trifactorization technique that performs coclustering while accounting for the spatial correlation of the data. We propose an estimation algorithm that solves the proposed matrix trifactorization problem. Moreover, to improve scalability, we also propose two heuristic approximations of the most expensive steps, which help the algorithm converge while significantly streamlining the computational cost. We validated our method on a series of simulation experiments, comparing the different estimating strategies discussed in the article. Last, we analyzed a mouse brain tissue sample processed with MALDI-MSI technology, showing how TRIFASE extracts specific expression patterns of molecule abundance in localized tissue areas and discovers blocks of proteins whose activation is directly linked to specific biological mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Borrowing external controls to augment the concurrent control arm is a popular topic in clinical trials. Bayesian dynamic borrowing methods adaptively discount external controls according to prior-data conflict. For the Gaussian endpoint, parameter-specific information borrowing enables differential discounting between the population mean and variance. The borrowing-by-part power prior employs two power parameters to separately downweight external likelihoods concerning the sample mean and variance. However, within the fully Bayesian framework, the posterior inference of the average treatment effect (ATE) defined as the population mean difference is significantly affected by the variance-specific prior-data conflict that reflects the heterogeneity of population variance. Here, we propose the modified conditional borrowing-by-part power prior (MCBPP) that separately discounts the external sample mean and variance according to parameter-specific prior-data conflicts, resulting in a more stable posterior estimation of ATE than its competitors under the same degree of mean-specific prior-data conflict. By fully discounting the external sample variance, the robust MCBPP (rMCBPP) can yield robust posterior inference of ATE against the variance-specific prior-data conflict. Although the population variance is considered a nuisance parameter, its homogeneity is equally important to justify information borrowing. We recommend the rMCBPP for borrowing external controls with a similar sample variance to concurrent controls because it exhibits better control of bias and Type I error rate than the modified power prior (MPP) assuming unknown variance in the absence of population variance heterogeneity. However, when faced with a significant sample variance discrepancy, the MPP assuming unknown variance is preferred given its better performance under severe population variance heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {The mean residual life (MRL) function plays an important role in the summary and analysis of survival data. The main advantage of this function is that it summarizes the information in units of time instead of a probability scale, which requires careful interpretation. Ranked set sampling (RSS) is a sampling technique designed for situations, where obtaining precise measurements of sample units is expensive or difficult, but ranking them without referring to their accurate values is cost-effective or easy. However, the practical application of RSS is hindered because each sample unit is required to assign a unique rank. To alleviate this difficulty, Frey developed a novel variation of RSS, called RSS-t, that records and utilizes the tie structure in the ranking process. In this paper, we propose several different nonparametric estimators for the MRL function based on RSS-t. Then, we compare the proposed estimators with their counterparts in simple random sampling (SRS) and RSS, where tie information is not utilized. We also implemented our proposed estimators on a real data set related to patient waiting times for liver transplantation, to show their applicability and efficiency in practice. Our results show that using ties information leads to an improved statistical inference for the MRL function, and therefore a smaller sample size is needed to reach a predetermined precision.},

A novel deep time series aggregation scheme (DTSAs) is proposed to generate typical operational scenarios, considering the large amount of historical operational snapshot data. Specifically, DTSAs analyse the intrinsic mechanisms of different scheduling operational scenario switching to mathematically represent typical operational scenarios. A Gramian angular summation field-based operational scenario image encoder was designed to convert operational scenario sequences into high-dimensional spaces. This enables DTSAs to fully capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of new power systems using deep feature iterative aggregation models. The encoder also facilitates the generation of typical operational scenarios that conform to historical data distributions while ensuring the integrity of grid operational snapshots. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method extracted new fine-grained power system dispatch schemes and outperformed the latest high-dimensional feature-screening methods. In addition, experiments with different new energy access ratios were conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed method. DTSAs enable dispatchers to master the operation experience of the power system in advance, and actively respond to the dynamic changes of the operation scenarios under the high access rate of new energy.},

In this paper, a novel training-free method that utilises the Pre-Trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) model as a data augmentation tool (PTSAM-DA) is proposed to generate the augmented annotations for images. Without the need for training, it obtains prompt boxes from the original annotations and then feeds the boxes to the pre-trained SAM to generate diverse and improved annotations. In this way, annotations are augmented more ingenious than simple manipulations without incurring huge computation for training a data augmentation model. Multiple comparative experiments on three datasets are conducted, including an in-house dataset, ADE20K and COCO2017. On this in-house dataset, namely Agricultural Plot Segmentation Dataset, maximum improvements of 3.77% and 8.92% are gained in two mainstream metrics, mIoU and mAcc, respectively. Consequently, large vision models like SAM are proven to be promising not only in image segmentation but also in data augmentation.},

In this study, WaveSeg-UNet, a lightweight model, is introduced to segment cancerous nuclei having touching boundaries. Residual blocks are used for feature extraction. Only one feature extractor block is used in each level of the encoder and decoder. Normally, images degrade quality and lose important information during down-sampling. To overcome this loss, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) alongside max-pooling is used in the down-sampling process. Inverse DWT is used to regenerate original images during up-sampling. In the bottleneck of the proposed model, atrous spatial channel pyramid pooling (ASCPP) is used to extract effective high-level features. The ASCPP is the modified pyramid pooling having atrous layers to increase the area of the receptive field. Spatial and channel-based attention are used to focus on the location and class of the identified objects. Finally, watershed transform is used as a post processing technique to identify and refine touching boundaries of nuclei. Nuclei are identified and counted to facilitate pathologists. The same domain of transfer learning is used to retrain the model for domain adaptability.

However, terahertz images usually have the problems of heavy noises and low resolution. Previous terahertz image denoising methods are mainly based on traditional image processing methods, which have limited denoising effects on the terahertz noise. Existing deep learning-based image denoising methods are mostly used in natural images and easily cause a large amount of detail loss when denoising terahertz images. Here, a residual-learning-based multiscale hybrid-convolution residual network (MHRNet) is proposed for terahertz image denoising, which can remove noises while preserving detail features in terahertz images. Specifically, a multiscale hybrid-convolution residual block (MHRB) is designed to extract rich detail features and local prediction residual noise from terahertz images. Specifically, MHRB is a residual structure composed of a multiscale dilated convolution block, a bottleneck layer, and a multiscale convolution block. MHRNet uses the MHRB and global residual learning to achieve terahertz image denoising. Ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of MHRB. A series of experiments are conducted on the public terahertz image datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that MHRNet has an excellent denoising effect on synthetic and real noisy terahertz images.

MBOPE directly approximates the unknown value of a given policy using the Monte Carlo method given the estimated transition and reward functions of the environment. Usually, multiple models are trained, and then one of them is selected to be used. However, a challenge remains in selecting an appropriate model from those trained for further use. The authors first analyse the upper bound of the difference between the approximated value and the unknown true value. Theoretical results show that this difference is related to the trajectories generated by the given policy on the learnt model and the prediction error of the transition and reward functions at these generated data points. Based on the theoretical results, a new criterion is proposed to tell which trained model is better suited for evaluating the given policy.

  abstract     = {In computer vision applications like surveillance and remote sensing, to mention a few, deep learning has had considerable success. Medical imaging still faces a number of difficulties, including intra-class similarity, a scarcity of training data, and poor contrast skin lesions, notably in the case of skin cancer. An optimisation-aided deep learning-based system is proposed for accurate multi-class skin lesion identification. The sequential procedures of the proposed system start with preprocessing and end with categorisation. The preprocessing step is where a hybrid contrast enhancement technique is initially proposed for lesion identification with healthy regions. Instead of flipping and rotating data, the outputs from the middle phases of the hybrid enhanced technique are employed for data augmentation in the next step. Next, two pre-trained deep learning models, MobileNetV2 and NasNet Mobile, are trained using deep transfer learning on the upgraded enriched dataset. Later, a dual-threshold serial approach is employed to obtain and combine the features of both models. The next step was the variance-controlled Marine Predator methodology, which the authors proposed as a superior optimisation method. The top features from the fused feature vector are classified using machine learning classifiers. The experimental strategy provided enhanced accuracy of 94.4% using the publicly available dataset HAM10000. Additionally, the proposed framework is evaluated compared to current approaches, with remarkable results.},

  abstract     = {Images with complementary spectral information can be recorded using image sensors that can identify visible and near-infrared spectrum. The fusion of visible and near-infrared (NIR) aims to enhance the quality of images acquired by video monitoring systems for the ease of user observation and data processing. Unfortunately, current fusion algorithms produce artefacts and colour distortion since they cannot make use of spectrum properties and are lacking in information complementarity. Therefore, an information complementarity fusion (ICF) model is designed based on physical signals. In order to separate high-frequency noise from important information in distinct frequency layers, the authors first extracted texture-scale and edge-scale layers using a two-scale filter. Second, the difference map between visible and near-infrared was filtered using the extended-DoG filter to produce the initial visible-NIR complementary weight map. Then, to generate a guide map, the near-infrared image with night adjustment was processed as well. The final complementarity weight map was subsequently derived via an arctanI function mapping using the guide map and the initial weight maps. Finally, fusion images were generated with the complementarity weight maps. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in both avoiding artificial colours as well as effectively utilising information complementarity.},

However, the manual calculation of these parameters is challenging due to the high variability among patients and the time-consuming nature of the process.

The FRN is tailored for representing global image features, facilitating the direct acquisition of left ventricle (LV) contour images through pixel classification. Additionally, the IEN incorporates specifically designed modules to extract relevant clinical indices. The authors’ method considers the interdependence of different tasks, demonstrating the validity of these relationships and yielding favourable results. Through extensive experiments on cardiac MR images from 145 patients, MultiJSQ achieves impressive outcomes, with low mean absolute errors of 124 mm 2 , 1.72 mm, and 1.21 mm for areas, dimensions, and regional wall thicknesses, respectively, along with a Dice metric score of 0.908. The experimental findings underscore the excellent performance of our framework in LV segmentation and quantification, highlighting its promising clinical application prospects.},

A hybrid methodology based on the integration of Taguchi method and genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to estimate the optimal cut point temperature for various sets of process variables. Optimised datasets were utilised to develop an artificial neural networks (ANN) model for the prediction of optimum values of cut points. The ANN model was then used to replace the hybrid framework of the Taguchi method and the GA. The integration of the ANN and FP model makes it a grey-box (GB) model. For the case of Zamama crude, the GB model helped in the decrease of up to 38.93% in energy required per kilo barrel of diesel and an 8.2% increase in diesel production compared to the stand-alone FP model under uncertainty. Similarly, for Kunnar crude, up to 18.87% decrease in energy required per kilo barrel of diesel and a 33.96% increase in diesel production was observed in comparison to the stand-alone FP model.},

  abstract     = {Bilingual lexicon induction focuses on learning word translation pairs, also known as bitexts, from monolingual corpora by establishing a mapping between the source and target embedding spaces. Despite recent advancements, bilingual lexicon induction is limited to inducing bitexts consisting of individual words, lacking the ability to handle semantics-rich phrases. To bridge this gap and support downstream cross-lingual tasks, it is practical to develop a method for bilingual phrase induction that extracts bilingual phrase pairs from monolingual corpora without relying on cross-lingual knowledge. In this paper, the authors propose a novel phrase embedding training method based on the skip-gram structure. Specifically, a local hard negative sampling strategy that utilises negative samples of central tokens in sliding windows to enhance phrase embedding learning is introduced. The proposed method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with exceptional results recorded for distant languages. Additionally, we develop a phrase representation learning method that leverages multilingual pre-trained language models. These mPLMs-based representations can be combined with the above-mentioned static phrase embeddings to further improve the accuracy of the bilingual phrase induction task. We manually construct a dataset of bilingual phrase pairs and integrate it with MUSE to facilitate the bilingual phrase induction task.},

However, branching networks, not originally tailored for IoT environments, are susceptible to noisy and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and they demand additional training for optimal performance. The authors introduce BrevisNet, a novel branching methodology designed for creating on-device branching models that are both resource-adaptive and noise-robust for IoT applications. The method leverages the refined uncertainty estimation capabilities of Dirichlet distributions for classification predictions, combined with the superior OOD detection of energy-based models.

  abstract     = {Intelligent sorting is an important prerequisite for the full quantitative consumption and harmless disposal of kitchen waste. The existing object detection method based on an ImageNet pre-trained model is an effective way of sorting. Owing to significant domain gaps between natural images and kitchen waste images, it is difficult to reflect the characteristics of diverse scales and dense distribution in kitchen waste based on an ImageNet pre-trained model, leading to poor generalisation. In this article, the authors propose the first pre-trained model for kitchen waste sorting called KitWaSor, which combines both contrastive learning (CL) and masked image modelling (MIM) through self-supervised learning (SSL). First, to address the issue of diverse scales, the authors propose a mixed masking strategy by introducing an incomplete masking branch based on the original random masking branch. It prevents the complete loss of small-scale objects while avoiding excessive leakage of large-scale object pixels. Second, to address the issue of dense distribution, the authors introduce semantic consistency constraints on the basis of the mixed masking strategy. That is, object semantic reasoning is performed through semantic consistency constraints to compensate for the lack of contextual information. To train KitWaSor, the authors construct the first million-level kitchen waste dataset across seasonal and regional distributions, named KWD-Million. Extensive experiments show that KitWaSor achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the two most relevant downstream tasks for kitchen waste sorting (i.e. image classification and object detection), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed KitWaSor.},

  abstract     = {Images obtained from hyperspectral sensors provide information about the target area that extends beyond the visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, due to sensor limitations and imperfections during the image acquisition and transmission phases, noise is introduced into the acquired image, which can have a negative impact on downstream analyses such as classification, target tracking, and spectral unmixing. Noise in hyperspectral images (HSI) is modelled as a combination from several sources, including Gaussian/impulse noise, stripes, and deadlines. An HSI restoration method for such a mixed noise model is proposed. First , a joint optimisation framework is proposed for recovering hyperspectral data corrupted by mixed Gaussian-impulse noise by estimating both the clean data as well as the sparse/impulse noise levels. Second , a hyper-Laplacian prior is used along both the spatial and spectral dimensions to express sparsity in clean image gradients. Third , to model the sparse nature of impulse noise, an ℓ 1 − norm over the impulse noise gradient is used. Because the proposed methodology employs two distinct priors, the authors refer to it as the hyperspectral dual prior (HySpDualP) denoiser. To the best of authors&#39; knowledge, this joint optimisation framework is the first attempt in this direction. To handle the non-smooth and non-convex nature of the general ℓp − norm-based regularisation term, a generalised shrinkage/thresholding (GST) solver is employed. Finally , an efficient split-Bregman approach is used to solve the resulting optimisation problem. Experimental results on synthetic data and real HSI datacube obtained from hyperspectral sensors demonstrate that the authors’ proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both visually and in terms of various image quality assessment metrics.},

  abstract     = {Real-world data always exhibit an imbalanced and long-tailed distribution, which leads to poor performance for neural network-based classification. Existing methods mainly tackle this problem by reweighting the loss function or rebalancing the classifier. However, one crucial aspect overlooked by previous research studies is the imbalanced feature space problem caused by the imbalanced angle distribution. In this paper, the authors shed light on the significance of the angle distribution in achieving a balanced feature space, which is essential for improving model performance under long-tailed distributions. Nevertheless, it is challenging to effectively balance both the classifier norms and angle distribution due to problems such as the low feature norm. To tackle these challenges, the authors first thoroughly analyse the classifier and feature space by decoupling the classification logits into three key components: classifier norm (i.e. the magnitude of the classifier vector), feature norm (i.e. the magnitude of the feature vector), and cosine similarity between the classifier vector and feature vector. In this way, the authors analyse the change of each component in the training process and reveal three critical problems that should be solved, that is, the imbalanced angle distribution, the lack of feature discrimination, and the low feature norm. Drawing from this analysis, the authors propose a novel loss function that incorporates hyperspherical uniformity, additive angular margin, and feature norm regularisation. Each component of the loss function addresses a specific problem and synergistically contributes to achieving a balanced classifier and feature space. The authors conduct extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. The experimental results demonstrate that the authors’ loss function outperforms several previous state-of-the-art methods in addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced and long-tailed datasets, that is, by improving upon the best-performing baselines on CIFAR-100-LT by 1.34, 1.41, 1.41 and 1.33, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI), the detrimental influence of noise and distortions on data quality is profound, which has severely affected the following-on analytics and decision-making such as land mapping. This study presents an innovative framework for assessing HSI band quality and reconstructing the low-quality bands, based on the Prophet model. By introducing a comprehensive quality metric to start, the authors approach factors in both spatial and spectral characteristics across local and global scales. This metric effectively captures the intricate noise and distortions inherent in the HSI data. Subsequently, the authors employ the Prophet model to forecast information within the low-quality bands, leveraging insights from neighbouring high-quality bands. To validate the effectiveness of the authors’ proposed model, extensive experiments on three publicly available uncorrected datasets are conducted. In a head-to-head comparison, the framework against six state-of-the-art band reconstruction algorithms including three spectral methods, two spatial-spectral methods and one deep learning method is benchmarked. The authors’ experiments also delve into strategies for band selection based on quality metrics and the quality evaluation of the reconstructed bands. In addition, the authors assess the classification accuracy utilising these reconstructed bands. In various experiments, the results consistently affirm the efficacy of the authors’ method in HSI quality assessment and band reconstruction. Notably, the authors’ approach obviates the need for manually prefiltering of noisy bands. This comprehensive framework holds promise in addressing HSI data quality concerns whilst enhancing the overall utility of HSI.},

To address this limitation, an enhanced car-following algorithm utilising ADRC is proposed, which integrates the improved ESO with a feedback controller. In comparison to the conventional ESO, the enhanced version effectively utilises multi-order estimation and tracking errors. Specifically, it enhances convergence rates by incorporating feedback from higher-order estimation errors and ensures the estimated value converges to the reference value by utilising tracking error feedback. The improved ESO significantly enhances the disturbance rejection performance of ADRC.

In this context, the Seru Production System (SPS) has emerged as a highly adaptable production mode and emphasizes the strategic assignment of cross-trained workers, particularly in hybrid configurations combining divisional and rotating serus. This paper proposes a novel bi-objective mathematical model incorporating learning effects to minimize makespan and balance workloads among workers. With the development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) empowered big models, new breakthroughs have emerged in industrial manufacturing decision-making. These models utilize deep learning for foundational content processing and leverage reinforcement learning to optimize strategies. This process provides robust support for achieving efficient decision optimization. Building on the concepts of AIGC big models training, this study employs reinforcement learning to refine the results of multi-objective genetic algorithms, thereby improving the solution capability of the bi-objective model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively provides optimal strategies for tuning crossover and mutation operations. Additionally, numerical experiments offer insights into the formation of hybrid SPS configurations.},

The superpixel fiber flexibly exploits the local similarity at different scales and leads to significant low-rankness. In this paper, we propose the parallel HSI denoising models which simultaneously consider the local and global low-rankness of the HSI based on superpixel segmentation. In the proposed models, the non-convex but smooth log-determination function is adopted to better characterize the low-rankness of the HSI. We also propose an adaptive weighted strategy to optimize the restored HSI. An efficient iterative algorithm is developed to solve the parallel models. Several experiments verify the superior performance of the proposed approach over other competing methods.},

Accurate detection of the location and orientation of the runway can effectively assist in safe aircraft landings and avoid potential risks. However, existing runway detection methods struggle in foggy conditions due to light scattering, causing blurry images and obscuring runway details, resulting in poor detection performance. Towards this issue, this paper proposes an adaptive image-based runway boundary detection method by combining image processing and filter prediction to enhance images automatically. It leverages runway symmetry to enhance feature maps and global-local information fusion. A shape loss function based on the runway&#39;s parallel boundaries is also introduced. These developments finally endow the proposed method with robustness towards foggy conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the method&#39;s effectiveness, achieving an average IoU of 73.58 on internal datasets, surpassing other advanced methods.},

However, challenges such as lengthy data acquisition processes and susceptibility to noise can limit data availability and reduce classification accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the CosineGAN-transformer network (CGTNet), which integrates a dual discriminator GAN for generating high-quality synthetic data with a Transformer-based classification network. Equipped with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, this network excels at capturing the intricate spatiotemporal relationships inherent in high-resolution fNIRS signals. The dual discriminator framework ensures that both the temporal and spatial aspects of the synthetic data closely resemble the original signals, thereby enhancing data diversity and fidelity. Experimental results on a publicly available fNIRS dataset, comprising 30 participants performing motor imagery tasks (right-hand tapping, left-hand tapping, and foot tapping), demonstrate that CGTNet achieves an accuracy of 82.67%, outperforming existing methods. Key contributions of this work include the use of multi-head self-attention for refined feature extraction and a dual discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) framework that maintains data quality and consistency. These advancements significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of BCI systems, offering promising applications in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies.},

Therefore, based on machine learning, this paper proposes a new method to construct a real-time velocity field prediction model, which can directly predict the velocity field of the channel according to the water level.

The results suggest that the predictions are in line with the general features of flow velocity distribution in open channels and have high precision.

Based on this design framework, a complex-type dual-integral structure ZNN (DISZNN) model with inherent linear noise suppression capability is constructed for computing dynamic complex matrix inversion (DCMI) online. The stability, convergence, and robustness of the proposed DISZNN model are ensured via rigorous theoretical analyses. In three distinct experiments involving DCMI (including cases with only imaginary parts, both real and imaginary parts, and high-dimensional scenarios), the state trajectories of the DISZNN model are well and quickly fitted to the dynamic trajectories of the theoretical solutions with very low residual errors in various linear noise environments. More specifically, the residual errors of the DISZNN model for online computation of DCMI under linear noise environments are consistently below the order of , representing one-thousandth of the residual errors in existing noise-tolerant ZNN models. Finally, the DISZNN design framework is applied to construct a controlled chaotic system of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with uncertainties and external disturbances based on real-world modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the three state errors of the controlled PMSM chaotic system converge to zero quickly and stably under various conditions (system parameters, external disturbances, and uncertainties), further highlighting the superiority and generalizability of the DISZNN design framework.},

  abstract     = {Transfer functions have a very important role in metaheuristic optimization-based feature selection algorithms as these functions map the continuous search space into binary space. The U-shaped transfer function (UTF) is one of the transfer functions used to solve the problem of feature selection. However, the UTF requires the selection of parametric values, which can vary for different types of data. To address this issue, an approach to select the parameters of the UTF has been proposed based on a time-varying adaption method, resulting in the modified U-shaped transfer function (MUTF). Furthermore, a methodology has been proposed to enhance feature selection and classification for Parkinson&#39;s disease by utilizing z-score normalization in conjunction with a modified U-shaped transfer function and the binary self-adaptive bald eagle search (MUTF-SABES) optimization algorithm. The z-score normalization has been used to mitigate issues caused by outliers. Also, the performance of the k nearest neighbor classifier is improved by selecting an optimal parameter value using the proposed MUTF-SABES algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated on seven different Parkinson&#39;s disease datasets and compared with five state-of-the-art optimization algorithms: Salp Swarm algorithm, Harris Hawks optimization, equilibrium optimizer, aquilla optimizer, and Honey Badger algorithm, to evaluate its performance superiority. The results achieved using the proposed approach have been superior or analogous to the erstwhile algorithms for performance comparability. Friedman&#39;s mean rank test is used to check the statistical significance of the propounded approach. The lowest Friedman&#39;s mean rank value obtained using the proposed approach indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to become an alternative to other well-known strategies.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian detection is crucial in agricultural environments to ensure the safe operation of intelligent machinery. In orchards, pedestrians exhibit unpredictable behavior and can pose significant challenges to navigation and operation. This demands reliable detection technologies that ensures safety while addressing the unique challenges of orchard environments, such as dense foliage, uneven terrain, and varying lighting conditions. To address this, we propose ReB-DINO, a robust and accurate orchard pedestrian detection model based on an improved DINO. Initially, we improve the feature extraction module of DINO using structural re-parameterization, enhancing accuracy and speed of the model during training and inference decoupling. In addition, a progressive feature fusion module is employed to fuse the extracted features and improve model accuracy. Finally, the network incorporates a convolutional block attention mechanism and an improved loss function to improve pedestrian detection rates.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of video data has resulted in an increasing need for surveillance and violence detection systems. Although such events occur less frequently than normal activities, developing automated video surveillance systems for violence detection has become essential to minimize labor and time waste. Detecting violent activity in videos is a challenging task due to the variability and diversity of violent behavior, which can involve a wide range of actions, motions, and interactions between people and objects. Currently, researchers employ deep learning models to detect violent behaviors. In fact, a large number of deep learning approaches are based on extracting spatio-temporal information from a video by exploiting a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Despite their success, these techniques require a lot more parameters than 2D CNNs and have high computational complexity. Therefore, we focus on exploiting a 2D CNN to encode spatio-temporal information. Actually, statistical features of the optical flow changes are used to give this ability to a 2D CNN. These features are designed to make attention to regions of a video clip with much more motion. Accordingly, the optical flow of an input video is calculated. To determine meaningful changes in the optical flow, the optical flow magnitude of a current frame is compared with its predecessor. After that, statistical features of these changes are extracted to summarize a video clip to a 2D template, which feeds a 2D CNN. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets observe that the suggested strategy outperforms baseline ones. In particular, we make a better estimation of the spatio-temporal features in a video by shortening a video clip into a 2D template.},

  abstract     = {The early detection and classification of COVID-19 is crucial for disease diagnosis and control. To reduce the need for medical professionals, fast and accurate detection approaches for COVID-19 are required. Due to environmental concerns, the quality of the image gets degraded. Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19. Thus, the performance of the deep learning (DL) techniques is diminished. Therefore, a CT image-based hybrid DL technology is presented in this article for the classification of COVID-19 disease as COVID or non-COVID or pneumonia. Initially, in the pre-processing stage, the hybrid nonlocal moment bilateral filtering (Hybrid NMBF) technique is introduced for image de-noising and re-sizing. After pre-processing, the image is fed into the feature extraction phase. Gray-level covariance matrices (GLCM) technique is used to extract the relevant features and reduce feature dimensionality issues. For the feature selection process, the enhanced Archimedes optimization algorithm (EAOA) is introduced to select optimal features. The residual channel attention-generative adversarial network (RCA-GAN) technique is introduced for image classification. Here, the hyperparameter of the network is tuned using the Sandpiper optimization (SPO) algorithm to optimize the loss function. The data set used in this research is COVID-CT-machine learning deep learning (MD), and the performance is analyzed using the MATLAB tool. In the experimental scenario, the proposed system achieves 98.3% accuracy, 98.7% specificity, 99.4% sensitivity, 97.4% F -score, and 96.1% kappa. The attained results prove that the proposed system works better than the traditional techniques.},

  abstract     = {Several companies leverage trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to offer predictive services to users. These companies capitalize on CNNs&#39; superior performance in image processing tasks, such as autonomous driving or face recognition. To safeguard data privacy and model parameters, various algorithms have been proposed. Most of them are predominantly designed using secure multi-party computation (MPC) or hardware-assisted solutions. However, certain limitations persist. First, MPC-based approaches (e.g., garbled circuits, homomorphic encryption) fail to meet rapid responsiveness requirements. Additionally, hardware-assisted solutions impose extra burdens to realize secure inference tasks. The primary reasons for these shortcomings can be summarized as follows: (1) high computation and communication delays are introduced by heavy cryptographic operations during the online phase. (2) Additional overhead for sharing triples. In this article, we propose PCIR, a secure protocol for privacy-preserving convolutional neural network inference (PCIR). PCIR aims to address the aforementioned issues based on a pre-shared secret sharing mechanism. It can achieve rapid responses to user requirements and preserve privacy of data and model for the following reasons: (1) it circumvents computationally expensive operations, such as an operation for permuting plaintext slots, which runs 56 times slower than a homomorphic addition operation, and 34 times slower than a homomorphic multiplication operation. (2) Computational operations, such as homomorphic additions or multiplications, are conducted during the pre-computation phase. It can significantly reduce the online computing costs. (3) PCIR conducts secure multiplication based on pre-shared secret shares. It results in much lower communication and computation costs compared with the use of multiplicative triples. Finally, we evaluate PCIR with benchmark neural networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results have shown that PCIR requires less time and less communication cost than previous methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Land coverage mapping and classification is one of the critical information-based tools for sustainable agricultural development, enabling relevant departments to carry out agricultural resource adjustments, yield predictions, and other tasks in advance. As a vital means of acquiring land cover and usage information, SAR sensors have become an important research direction due to their all-weather and all-day working capabilities. Nevertheless, traditional classification methods in PolSAR image classification often input a combination of various scattering features, i.e., high-dimensional feature combination, into classifiers, leading to mutual interference among different features and consequently degrading classification performance, especially for linear classifiers such as NRS and SVM. To mitigate this interference, this paper proposed an unsupervised feature selection based on spectral clustering (FSSC) that constructs a targeted approach by leveraging the linear expression capabilities of high-dimensional features. In this method, the linear relationships between different features are first analyzed, and the linear similarity between features can be quantitatively expressed using Pearson correlation coefficients, forming a feature similarity matrix. Subsequently, the similarity matrix undergoes unsupervised similarity partitioning through spectral clustering, dividing the features into distinct combinations. Features within clustering subsets can be considered as combinations with high linear similarity. Therefore, KL divergence is applied to select the most representative features within each cluster, and the resulting representative feature combinations from different clustering subsets are combined to form an optimal feature set, achieving the purpose of feature selection. This method maps high-dimensional feature combinations into low-dimensional ones while preserving the essential attributes of the original data, thereby retaining the valuable feature information and enhancing classification performance. Experimental outcomes conclusively show that the proposed method enhances the overall accuracy (OA) of SVM by 4.51% and the OA of NRS by 2.34% in the Flevoland Dataset, underscoring its efficacy in PolSAR image classification, especially for linear classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering is a widely used method in recommender systems research. However, contrary to the assumption that it relies solely on rating data, many contemporary models incorporate review information to address issues such as data sparsity. Although previous recommender systems utilised review texts to capture user preferences and item features, they often rely on a single-embedding model to represent these features, which may limit the richness of the extracted information. Recent advancements suggest that combining multiple pre-trained embedding models can enhance text representation by leveraging the strengths of different encoding methods. In this study, we propose a novel recommender system model, the Multi-embedding Fusion Network for Recommendation (MFNR), which employs a multi-embedding approach to effectively capture and represent user and item features in review texts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and its optimised variant, RoBERTa, both of which are pre-trained transformer-based models designed for natural language understanding. By leveraging their contextual embeddings, our model extracts enriched feature representations from review texts. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world review datasets from Amazon.com and Goodreads.com demonstrate that MFNR significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 9.18% in RMSE and 14.81% in MAE. These results highlight the efficacy of the multi-embedding approach, indicating its potential for broader application in complex recommendation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic time warping (DTW) is an algorithm used to measure the similarity between sequences, with widespread applications in domains such as speech recognition, image processing and video synchronisation. However, when matching a shorter multivariate time subsequence to a longer time series containing a similar subsequence, existing DTW variants struggle to accurately determine the matching path. To address this issue, we propose an improved algorithm, generalised weighted variance DTW (G-WVDTW). We extend the DTW algorithm to multivariate time series and introduce a weighted variance-based approach to calculate local distances. This allows the algorithm to better assess the distance between different time points in multivariate time series. Additionally, we modify the algorithm&#39;s boundary conditions, enabling it to handle subsequence matching tasks in multivariate time series. We conducted similarity retrieval experiments using public datasets and evaluated the algorithm&#39;s performance with the AUC metric, achieving up to a 19% improvement on certain datasets. Furthermore, we performed alignment experiments on industrial data, where we artificially generated aligned sequences and quantitatively assessed the alignment errors, which were lower than those produced by other DTW variants. Finally, we validated the algorithm&#39;s superior performance in multivariate time series subsequence matching tasks using a synthetic dataset and showcased its use in motif detection using a wind power generation dataset. The algorithm can be applied in fields such as industrial, meteorological and electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis for tasks like time series retrieval, matching and data labelling.},

Because both the historical learning courses and recommended learning paths can be represented as sequential patterns (SPs); it is reasonable to approach this problem through SP mining (SPM). In addition to support, we incorporate three factors, that is, course learning days, grades and engagement, to model frequent high-utility SPs (FHUSPs). When recommending a learning path, FHUSPs that align with the target user&#39;s learning history and are common among successful learners, while rare among less successful ones, are prioritised. If there are insufficient matching FHUSPs, we address this by recommending additional courses based on the joint competency and complementarity of learners similar to the target learner.

To discover better sets of patterns in less time, this paper introduces GRIMP (a Genetic algoRIthm for coMpression-based descriptive Pattern mining), a novel framework that combines a genetic algorithm with MDL-based pattern selection. Multiple genetic algorithm variants are explored within the GRIMP framework, and their effectiveness is compared using a large number of datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GRIMP consistently outperforms previous methods by achieving higher compression ratios, generating more representative itemsets, and requiring less time.

We run different experiments to provide benchmark results of Arabic sentiment classification. Comparative results on our dataset show that the highest performing baseline model when utilising manual labels was MARBERT, with an accuracy of up to 87%, which was pre-trained for Arabic on a massive amount of data. It should be noted that this model enhanced its performance additionally after pre-training on a dialectical Arabic and modern standard Arabic corpus.

  abstract     = {Advancements in 3GPP specifications and the extensive deployment of 5G networks have driven significant growth in the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). This development has led to an increase in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which provide capabilities such as automated navigation, ADAS, cruise control, and environmentally sustainable transportation in real-time. Additionally, the widespread adoption of CAVs has also escalated vulnerabilities within the IoV ecosystem, exposing it to potential cyberattacks. The integration of various functional interfaces has enlarged its attack surface, thereby increasing the risk of vehicle infiltration. Researchers have proposed various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to address the ongoing risk of vehicle attacks, without applying encryption and related authentication methods for intra-and inter-vehicular communications. However, a significant limitation of many IDSs is their dependency on characteristics specific to a particular category of vehicles, which limits their adaptability. Additionally, current IDSs frequently rely on one-dimensional features such as traffic, time, etc., which limits their capability of detecting attacks in adverse scenarios. Moreover, incorporating machine learning algorithms into IDSs deployed in automated automobiles causes an increase in computational demands. We propose to develop a collaborative IDS specifically designed for cloud-based vehicle environments. We aim to improve our capabilities of identifying intrusion detection and differentiate which are malicious by using multidimensional features. A customised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), optimised through hyperparameter tuning, is also developed for detecting the malicious vehicles and enhancing the overall IDS. To address the challenge of data diversity, we integrate various vehicular datasets into a unified feature space. This integration allows a single model to efficiently perform multi-classification tasks without frequent adjustments. Our feature space integrates dimensions such as traffic, time and so forth, levels, thereby expanding the spectrum of detectable attack scenarios. By identifying abnormal data points within this comprehensive feature framework, our system effectively identifies intrusions across a diverse range of vehicle types. As a result, our methodology supports robust intrusion detection through comprehensive multiclass vehicle classification.},

IoMT consist of medical devices that can link to the internet or other networks, including wearables, sensors, monitoring tools and other medical appliances. IoMT data can be utilised to lower costs, increase the effectiveness of healthcare delivery and improve the patient health status. In addition to the potential benefits IoMT may provide, the impact of COVID19 pandemic has also strengthened the desire to collect patient data remotely and pushed a lot of medical professionals to utilise IoMT applications such as telemedicine, telehealth, remote patient monitoring, remote patient diagnostics and distant consultations etc. The expectation is that IoMT market size and the usage will increase dramatically and IoMT will change the conventional healthcare systems significantly in the upcoming years. Motivated with that growth expectation, this study aims to analyse the IoMT, its components, enabling technologies and applications by emphasising the fundamental pillars (sensing, communication, data analytics, and security) essential for developing a reliable, dependable, and secure IoMT ecosystem. Furthermore, this study conducts a detailed analysis of recent major cyberattacks targeting the healthcare industry, evaluating their impact and discussing the key lessons derived from these incidents by employing DOTMLPFI approach. Additionally, this survey offers a concise overview of the emerging technologies that complement IoMT in the development of smart healthcare systems and explores potential future directions within this evolving field.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly vital across numerous sectors, from logistics and rescue operations to military endeavours and beyond. However, ensuring safety in the decision-making processes surrounding UAV operations in real-world settings has become an urgent and complex challenge. At present, the main methods to minimise the risk of drone decision-making include utilising pre-established control rules, expert prior knowledge and regularisation constraints. However, these methodologies require UAVs to meet demanding prerequisites, including the acquisition of extensive decision-making experience and the establishment of comprehensive rules. Regrettably, these strict requirements often lead to frequent UAV crashes in uncertain environments and subsequent mission failures. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a self-decision-making method for quadcopter UAVs based on safe reinforcement learning. Our method utilises a multilevel cascading feature semantic space for reinforcement learning, integrating depth images, greyscale images, semantic segmentation images and object detection results as inputs. This approach aims to facilitate safe autonomous learning. Moreover, we integrate real offline labelled data to enhance the safety policy. Depending on the varying levels of risk encountered during the UAV&#39;s decision-making process, we dynamically select different safety policies. Through this iterative process, the UAV progressively eliminates extreme actions and reverts to the UAV learning policy module. Experimental results indicate that our method not only ensures safe decision-making for UAVs in uncertain environments but also exhibits superior safety decision-making efficacy compared to certain baseline methods.},

It addresses the significant classification modelling challenges, including (1) the requirements for extensive labelled data and (2) the complex optimisation problem for selection of appropriate temporal windows in the absence of prior knowledge of cultivation calendars. We compare the lightweight Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) classification method with the heavily supervised Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) using high-resolution multispectral optical satellite imagery (3 m/pixel). Our approach integrates effective practical preprocessing steps, including data augmentation and a data-driven optimisation strategy for the temporal window, even in the presence of numerous crop classes. Our findings demonstrate that DTW, despite its lower data demands, can match the performance of CNN-LSTM through our effective preprocessing steps while significantly improving runtime. These results demonstrate that both CNN-LSTM and DTW can achieve deployment-level accuracy and underscore the potential of DTW as a viable alternative to more resource-intensive models. The results also prove the effectiveness of temporal windowing for improving runtime and accuracy of a crop classification study, even with no prior knowledge of planting timeframes.},

Hence, continual learning has been studied in various artificial intelligence tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the recent progress of continual learning in computer vision. In particular, the works are grouped by their representative techniques, including regularisation, knowledge distillation, memory, generative replay, parameter isolation and a combination of the above techniques. For each category of these techniques, both its characteristics and applications in computer vision are presented.

  abstract     = {With the development of the 3D point cloud field in recent years, point cloud completion of 3D objects has increasingly attracted researchers&#39; attention. Point cloud data can accurately express the shape information of 3D objects at different resolutions, but the original point clouds collected directly by various 3D scanning equipment are often incomplete and have uneven density. Tactile is one distinctive way to perceive the 3D shape of an object. Tactile point clouds can provide local shape information for unknown areas during completion, which is a valuable complement to the point cloud data acquired with visual devices. In order to effectively improve the effect of point cloud completion using tactile information, the authors propose an innovative tactile-assisted point cloud completion network, TAPCNet. This network is the first neural network customised for the input of tactile point clouds and incomplete point clouds, which can fuse two types of point cloud information in the feature domain. Besides, a new dataset named 3DVT was rebuilt, to fit the proposed network model. Based on the tactile fusion strategy and related modules, multiple comparative experiments were conducted by controlling the quantity of tactile point clouds on the 3DVT dataset. The experimental data illustrates that TAPCNet can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in the benchmark.},

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Although some approaches have begun to investigate the robustness of 3D object detection models, they are currently generating adversarial examples in a white-box setting and there is a lack of research into generating transferable adversarial examples in a black-box setting. In this paper, a non-end-to-end attack algorithm was proposed for LiDAR pipelines that crafts transferable adversarial examples against 3D object detection. Specifically, the method generates adversarial examples by restraining features with high contribution to downstream tasks and amplifying features with low contribution to downstream tasks in the feature space. Extensive experiments validate that the method produces more transferable adversarial point clouds, for example, the method generates adversarial point clouds in the nuScenes dataset that are about 10 and 7 better than the state-of-the-art method on mAP and NDS, respectively.},

In the field of 3D point cloud classification, transfer-based black-box attack strategies have been explored to address the challenge of limited knowledge about the model in practical scenarios. However, existing approaches typically rely excessively on network structure, resulting in poor transferability of the generated adversarial examples. To address the above problem, the authors propose AEattack , an adversarial attack method capable of generating highly transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, AEattack employs an autoencoder (AE) to extract features from the point cloud data and reconstruct the adversarial point cloud based on these features. Notably, the AE does not require pre-training, and its parameters are jointly optimised using a loss function during the process of generating adversarial point clouds. The method makes the generated adversarial point cloud not overly dependent on the network structure, but more concerned with the data distribution. Moreover, this design endows AEattack with a broader potential for application. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset show that AEattack is capable of generating highly transferable adversarial point clouds, with up to 61.8% improvement in transferability compared to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an upward trend that marine vessels, an important object category in marine monitoring, have gradually become a research focal point in the field of computer vision, such as detection, tracking, and classification. Among them, marine vessel re-identification (Re-ID) emerges as a significant frontier research topics, which not only faces the dual challenge of huge intra-class and small inter-class differences, but also has complex environmental interference in the port monitoring scenarios. To propel advancements in marine vessel Re-ID technology, SwinTransReID, a framework grounded in the Swin Transformer for marine vessel Re-ID, is introduced. Specifically, the project initially encodes the triplet images separately as a sequence of blocks and construct a baseline model leveraging the Swin Transformer, achieving better performance on the Re-ID benchmark dataset in comparison to convolution neural network (CNN)-based approaches. And it introduces side information embedding (SIE) to further enhance the robust feature-learning capabilities of Swin Transformer, thus, integrating non-visual cues (orientation and type of vessel) and other auxiliary information (hull colour) through the insertion of learnable embedding modules. Additionally, the project presents VesselReID-1656, the first annotated large-scale benchmark dataset for vessel Re-ID in real-world ocean surveillance, comprising 135,866 images of 1656 vessels along with 5 orientations, 12 types, and 17 colours. The proposed method achieves 87.1 mAP and 96.1 Rank-1 accuracy on the newly-labelled challenging dataset, which surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.9 mAP regarding to performance. Moreover, extensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SwinTransReID on the person Market-1501 dataset, vehicle VeRi-776 dataset, and Boat Re-ID vessel dataset.},

  abstract     = {Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian images captured by nonoverlapping visible and infrared cameras. Most existing compensation-based methods try to generate images of missing modality from the other ones. However, the generated images often fail to possess enough quality due to severe discrepancies between different modalities. Moreover, it is generally assumed that person images are roughly aligned during the extraction of part-based local features. However, this does not always hold true, typically when they are cropped via inaccurate pedestrian detectors. To alleviate such problems, the authors propose a novel feature-level compensation and alignment network (FCA-Net) for VI-ReID in this paper, which tries to compensate for the missing modality information on the channel-level and align part-based local features. Specifically, the visible and infrared features of low-level subnetworks are first processed by a channel feature compensation (CFC) module, which enforces the network to learn consistent distribution patterns of channel features, and thereby the cross-modality discrepancy is narrowed. To address spatial misalignment, a pairwise relation module (PRM) is introduced to incorporate human structural information into part-based local features, which can significantly enhance the feature discrimination power. Besides, a cross-modality part alignment loss (CPAL) is designed on the basis of a dynamic part matching algorithm, which can promote more accurate local matching. Extensive experiments on three standard VI-ReID datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that state-of-the-art performance is achieved.},

Plant diseases, a major threat to agriculture, lead to significant losses in crops and financial damage. Standard techniques for detecting diseases, though widespread, are lengthy and intensive work, especially in extensive agricultural settings. This systematic literature review examines the cutting-edge technologies in smart agriculture specifically computer vision, robotics, deep learning (DL), and Internet of Things (IoT) that are reshaping plant disease detection and management. By analysing 198 studies published between 2021 and 2023, from an initial pool of 19,838 papers, the authors reveal the dominance of DL, particularly with datasets such as PlantVillage, and highlight critical challenges, including dataset limitations, lack of geographical diversity, and the scarcity of real-world field data. Moreover, the authors explore the promising role of IoT, robotics, and drones in enhancing early disease detection, although the high costs and technological gaps present significant barriers for small-scale farmers, especially in developing countries. Through the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses methodology, this review synthesises these findings, identifying key trends, uncovering research gaps, and offering actionable insights for the future of plant disease management in smart agriculture.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a compelling solution to bridge the gap between labelled synthetic data and unlabelled real-world data for training semantic segmentation models, given the high costs associated with manual annotation. However, the visual differences between the synthetic and real images pose significant challenges to their practical applications. This work addresses these challenges through synthetic-to-real style transfer leveraging diffusion models. The authors’ proposal incorporates semantic controllers to guide the diffusion process and low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to ensure that style-transferred images align with real-world aesthetics while preserving semantic layout. Moreover, the authors introduce quality metrics to rank the utility of generated images, enabling the selective use of high-quality images for training. To further enhance reliability, the authors propose a novel loss function that mitigates artefacts from the style transfer process by incorporating only pixels aligned with the original semantic labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the authors’ proposal outperforms selected state-of-the-art methods for image generation and UDA training, achieving optimal performance even with a smaller set of high-quality generated images.

In practical applications, the constraints of observation trajectories frequently lead to the acquisition of a limited dataset of sparse SAR images, presenting challenges for TomoSAR 3D Reconstruction and affecting its signal-to-noise ratio and elevation resolution performance. The study introduces a cascade adversarial strategy based on the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), optimised explicitly for sparse observation trajectories. In the preliminary phase of the CGAN, the U-Net architecture was employed to capture more global information and enhance image detail recovery capability, which is subsequently utilised in the cascade refinement network. The ResNet34 residual network in the advanced network stage was adopted to bolster feature extraction and image generation capabilities further. Based on experimental validation performed on the curated TomoSAR 3D super-resolution dataset tailored for buildings, the findings reveal that the methodology yields a notable enhancement in image quality and accuracy compared to other techniques.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration is a crucial aspect of computer vision and 3D reconstruction. Traditional registration methods often depend on global features or iterative optimisation, leading to inefficiencies and imprecise outcomes when processing complex scene point cloud data. To address these challenges, the authors introduce a principal direction-guided local voxelisation structural feature (PDLVSF) approach for point cloud registration. This method reliably identifies feature points regardless of initial positioning. Approach begins with the 3D Harris algorithm to extract feature points, followed by determining the principal direction within the feature points&#39; radius neighbourhood to ensure rotational invariance. For scale invariance, voxel grid normalisation is utilised to maximise the point cloud&#39;s geometric resolution and make it scale-independent. Cosine similarity is then employed for effective feature matching, identifying corresponding feature point pairs and determining transformation parameters between point clouds. Experimental validations on various datasets, including the real terrain dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Results indicate superior performance in root mean square error (RMSE) and registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high noise, limited overlap, and significant initial pose rotation.

  abstract     = {Egocentric action anticipation involves predicting future actions performed by the camera wearer from egocentric video. Although the task has recently gained attention in the research community, current approaches often assume that input videos are ‘trimmed’, meaning that a short video sequence is sampled a fixed time before the beginning of the action. However, trimmed action anticipation has limited applicability in real-world scenarios, where it is crucial to deal with ‘untrimmed’ video inputs and the exact moment of action initiation cannot be assumed at test time. To address these limitations, an untrimmed action anticipation task is proposed, which, akin to temporal action detection, assumes that the input video is untrimmed at test time, while still requiring predictions to be made before actions take place. The authors introduce a benchmark evaluation procedure for methods designed to address this novel task and compare several baselines on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 dataset. Through our experimental evaluation, testing a variety of models, the authors aim to better understand their performance in untrimmed action anticipation. Our results reveal that the performance of current models designed for trimmed action anticipation is limited, emphasising the need for further research in this area.},

Our framework innovates on several fronts: it uses Mosaic data augmentation to enrich the dataset and add small targets, incorporates a space to depth convolution (SPD-Conv) tailored for cells that are small and have low resolution, and introduces the Multi-Separated and Enhancement Attention Module (MultiSEAM) to enhance feature map resolution. Additionally, it integrates a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) for effective multi-scale feature fusion and includes four detection heads to improve recognition accuracy of various cell sizes, especially small target platelets. Evaluated on the Blood Cell Classification Dataset (BCCD), NBCDC-YOLOv8 obtains a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.7%, and thus surpasses the original YOLOv8n by 2.3%.},

In this paper, the authors investigate a robust classification method that extends the classical paradigm of robust geometric model fitting. The method views an image as a set of points in a low-dimensional space and analyses each image through low-dimensional geometric model fitting. In contrast, the majority of other methods, such as deep learning methods, treat an image as a single point in a high-dimensional space.

For many species, the re-identification can be done by analysing the permanent fur, feather, or skin patterns that are unique to each individual. In this paper, the authors study pattern feature aggregation based re-identification and consider two ways of improving accuracy: (1) aggregating pattern image features over multiple images and (2) combining the pattern appearance similarity obtained by feature aggregation and geometric pattern similarity. Aggregation over multiple database images of the same individual allows to obtain more comprehensive and robust descriptors while reducing the computation time. On the other hand, combining the two similarity measures allows to efficiently utilise both the local and global pattern features, providing a general re-identification approach that can be applied to a wide variety of different pattern types.

To improve the performance of network, the authors introduce a ‘re-encoding’ architecture and a regularisation loss function term, minimising the KL divergence between the distributions of features extracted by the first and second encoders. Unlike the common use of KL divergence loss to obtain a feature distribution close to an already-known distribution, the aim is to encourage the features extracted by the second encoder to have a close distribution to those extracted from the first encoder. The authors evaluate the proposed method on the Epic-Kitchens-55 dataset and conduct an ablation study to analyse the functions of different components. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms the comparison methods in all cases and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed re-encoding architecture and the regularisation term.},

  abstract     = {In ecology, deep learning is improving the performance of camera-trap image based wild animal analysis. However, high labelling cost becomes a big challenge, as it requires involvement of huge human annotation. For example, the Snapshot Serengeti (SS) dataset contains over 900,000 images, while only 322,653 contains valid animals, 68,000 volunteers were recruited to provide image level labels such as species, the no. of animals and five behaviour attributes such as standing, resting and moving etc. In contrast, the Gold Standard SS Bounding-Box Coordinates (GSBBC for short) contains only 4011 images for training of object detection algorithms, as the annotation of bounding-box for animals in the image, is much more costive. Such a no. of training images, is obviously insufficient. To address this, the authors propose a method to generate bounding-boxes for a larger dataset using limited manually labelled images. To achieve this, the authors first train a wild animal detector using a small dataset (e.g. GSBBC) that is manually labelled to locate animals in images; then apply this detector to a bigger dataset (e.g. SS) for bounding-box generation; finally, we remove false detections according to the existing label information of the images. Experiments show that detector trained with images whose bounding-boxes are generated using the proposal, outperformed the existing camera-trap image based animal detection, in terms of mean average precision (mAP). Compared with the traditional data augmentation method, our method improved the mAP by 21.3% and 44.9% for rare species, also alleviating the long-tail issue in data distribution. In addition, detectors trained with the proposed method also achieve promising results when applied to classification and counting tasks, which are commonly required in wildlife research.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-performance in multi-object tracking algorithms heavily relies on modelling spatial-temporal relationships during the data association stage. Mainstream approaches encompass rule-based and deep learning-based methods for spatial-temporal relationship modelling. While the former relies on physical motion laws, offering wider applicability but yielding suboptimal results for complex object movements, the latter, though achieving high-performance, lacks interpretability and involves complex module designs. This work aims to simplify deep learning-based spatial-temporal relationship models and introduce interpretability into features for data association. Specifically, a lightweight single-layer transformer encoder is utilised to model spatial-temporal relationships. To make features more interpretative, two contrastive regularisation losses based on representation alignment are proposed, derived from spatial-temporal consistency rules. By applying weighted summation to affinity matrices, the aligned features can seamlessly integrate into the data association stage of the original tracking workflow. Experimental results showcase that our model enhances the majority of existing tracking networks&#39; performance without excessive complexity, with minimal increase in training overhead and nearly negligible computational and storage costs.},

However, previous studies have neglected the presence of outliers in measurements, so that even a small percentage of outliers will significantly degrade precision. In order to deal with outliers, this paper proposes using a graduated non-convexity (GNC) method to suppress outliers in robust camera pose estimation, which serves as the core of GNCPnP. The authors first reformulate the camera pose estimation problem using a non-convex cost, which is less affected by outliers. Then, to apply a non-minimum solver to solve the reformulated problem, the authors use the Black-Rangarajan duality theory to transform it. Finally, to address the dependence of non-convex optimisation on initial values, the GNC method was customised according to the truncated least squares cost. The results of simulation and real experiments show that GNCPnP can effectively handle the interference of outliers and achieve higher accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, the camera pose estimation accuracy of GNCPnP in the case of a low percentage of outliers is almost comparable to that of the state-of-the-art algorithm in the case of no outliers.},

To address the issue, the authors propose an innovative approach to detect moving cast shadows by combining the hybrid feature with a broad learning system (BLS). The approach involves extracting low-level features from the input and background images based on colour constancy and texture consistency principles that are shown to be highly effective in moving cast shadow detection. The authors then utilise the BLS to create a hybrid feature and BLS uses the extracted low-level features as input instead of the original data. BLS is an innovative form of deep learning that can map input to feature nodes and further enhance them by enhancement nodes, resulting in more compact features for classification. Finally, the authors develop an efficient and straightforward post-processing technique to improve the accuracy of moving object detection.

  abstract     = {Recently, visual-language models (VLMs) have displayed potent capabilities in the field of computer vision. Their emerging trend as the backbone of visual tasks necessitates studying class incremental learning (CIL) issues within the VLM architecture. However, the pre-training data for many VLMs is proprietary, and during the incremental phase, old task data may also raise privacy issues. Moreover, replay-based methods can introduce new problems like class imbalance, the selection of data for replay and a trade-off between replay cost and performance. Therefore, the authors choose the more challenging rehearsal-free settings. In this paper, the authors study class-incremental tasks based on the large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP model. Initially, at the category level, the authors combine traditional optimisation and distillation techniques, utilising both pre-trained models and models trained in previous incremental stages to jointly guide the training of the new model. This paradigm effectively balances the stability and plasticity of the new model, mitigating the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, utilising the VLM infrastructure, the authors redefine the relationship between instances. This allows us to glean fine-grained instance relational information from the a priori knowledge provided during pre-training. The authors supplement this approach with an entropy-balancing method that allows the model to adaptively distribute optimisation weights across training samples. The authors’ experimental results validate that their method, within the framework of VLMs, outperforms traditional CIL methods.},

Leveraging artificial intelligence, with its rapid diagnostic speed, high accuracy, and fatigue resistance, to achieve intelligent assisted diagnosis of PD holds significant promise for alleviating patients&#39; financial stress, reducing diagnostic cycles, and helping patients seize the golden period for early treatment.

  abstract     = {The utilisation of domain adaptation methods facilitates the resolution of classification challenges in an unlabelled target domain by capitalising on the labelled information from source domains. Unfortunately, previous domain adaptation methods have focused mostly on global domain adaptation and have not taken into account class-specific data, which leads to poor knowledge transfer performance. The study of class-level domain adaptation, which aims to precisely match the distributions of different domains, has garnered attention in recent times. However, existing investigations into class-level alignment frequently align domain features either directly on or in close proximity to classification boundaries, resulting in the creation of uncertain samples that could potentially impair classification accuracy. To address the aforementioned problem, we propose a new approach called metric-guided class-level alignment (MCA) as a solution to this problem. Specifically, we employ different metrics to enable the network to acquire supplementary information, thereby enhancing class-level alignment. Moreover, MCA can be effectively combined with existing domain-level alignment methods to successfully mitigate the challenges posed by domain shift. Extensive testing on commonly-used public datasets shows that our method outperforms many other cutting-edge domain adaptation methods, showing significant gains over baseline performance.},

  abstract     = {Video prediction is the process of learning necessary information from historical frames to predict future video frames. Learning features from historical frames is a crucial step in this process. However, most current methods have a relatively single-scale learning approach, even if they learn features at different scales, they cannot fully integrate and utilise them, resulting in unsatisfactory prediction results. To address this issue, a hierarchical multi-scale fusion unit (HMSFU) is proposed. By using a hierarchical multi-scale architecture, each layer predicts future frames at different granularities using different convolutional scales. The abstract features from different layers can be fused, enabling the model not only to capture rich contextual information but also to expand the model&#39;s receptive field, enhance its expressive power, and improve its applicability to complex prediction scenarios. To fully utilise the expanded receptive field, HMSFU incorporates three fusion modules. The first module is the single-layer historical attention fusion module, which uses an attention mechanism to fuse the features from historical frames into the current frame at each layer. The second module is the single-layer spatiotemporal fusion module, which fuses complementary temporal and spatial features at each layer. The third module is the multi-layer spatiotemporal fusion module, which fuses spatiotemporal features from different layers. Additionally, the authors not only focus on the frame-level error using mean squared error loss, but also introduce the novel use of Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence to consider inter-frame variations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed HMSFU model achieves the best performance on popular video prediction datasets, showcasing its remarkable competitiveness in the field.},

As a result, this paper considers a lightweight object detection model named improved RTMDet-light to deal with these challenges.

Traditional 2D CNNs demonstrate low computational complexity but fail to capture temporal dynamics effectively. Conversely, 3D CNNs excel in recognising temporal patterns but at the cost of significantly higher computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose a generic and effective SME module composed of three parallel sub-modules, namely Spatio-Temporal Excitation (STE), Motion Excitation (ME) and Efficient Channel Excitation (ECE). Specifically, the STE module enhances the spatiotemporal representation using a single-channel 3D convolution, enabling the model to focus on both temporal and spatial features. The ME module emphasises motion-sensitive channels by calculating feature map differences at adjacent time steps, guiding the model toward motion-centric regions. The ECE module efficiently captures cross-channel interactions without dimensionality reduction, ensuring robust performance while significantly reducing model complexity. Pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, the proposed method achieved Top-1 accuracy of 49.0% on the Something-Something V1 (Sth-Sth V1) dataset and 40.8% on the Diving48 dataset. Extensive ablation studies and comparative experiments further demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an optimal balance between recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Current feature matching methods typically employ a two-stage process, consisting of coarse and fine matching. However, the transition from the coarse to the fine stage often lacks an effective intermediate state, leading to abrupt changes in the matching process. This can hinder smooth transitions and precise localization. To address these limitations, this study introduces Coarse-Mid-Fine Match Net (CMFNet), a novel three-stage image feature matching method. CMFNet incorporates an intermediate-grained matching phase between the coarse and fine stages to facilitate a more gradual and seamless transition. In the proposed method, the intermediate-grained matching refines the correspondences obtained from the coarse-grained stage using Adaptive-random sample consensus (RANSAC). Subsequently, the midtransformer, which integrates sparse self-attention (SSA) mechanisms with local-feature-based cross-attention, is employed for feature extraction. This approach enhances the feature extraction capabilities and improves the adaptability to various types of image data, thereby boosting overall matching performance. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism based on local region features is introduced. The network undergoes fully self-supervised training, aiming to minimize a match loss that is autonomously generated from the training data using a multi-scale cross-entropy method. A series of thorough experiments was carried out on diverse real-world datasets, including both unaltered and extensively processed images.The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 0.776 mAUC on the HPatches dataset and 0.442 mAUC on the ISC-HE dataset.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (Re-ID), a crucial research area in smart city security, faces challenges due to person posture changes, object occlusion and other factors, making it difficult for existing methods to accurately retrieving target person in video surveillance. To resolve this problem, we propose a person retrieval framework that integrates YOLOv8s and person Re-ID. Improved YOLOv8s is employed to extract person categories from the video on a frame-by-frame basis, and when combined with the stage-wise clustering person Re-ID network (SCPN), it enables collaborative person retrieval across multiple cameras. Notably, a feature precision (FP) module is added in the YOLOv8s network to form FP-YOLOv8s, and SCPN incorporates innovative enhancements including the stage-wise learning rate scheduler, centralized clustering loss and adaptive representation joint attention module into the person Re-ID baseline model. Comprehensive experiments on COCO, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms several other leading methods. Given the scarcity of image-video person Re-ID datasets, we also provide an extended image-video person (EIVP) dataset, which contains 102 videos and 814 bounding boxes of 57 identities captured by 8 cameras. The video reasoning detection score of this framework reaches 78.8% on this dataset, indicating a 3.2% increase compared to conventional models.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image segmentation is crucial for applications ranging from urban planning to environmental monitoring. However, traditional approaches struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including complex boundary delineation and intricate spatial relationships. To address these limitations, we introduce the semantic uncertainty-aware segmentation (SUAS) method, an innovative plug-and-play solution designed specifically for remote sensing image analysis. SUAS builds upon the rotated multi-scale interaction network (RMSIN) architecture and introduces the prompt refinement and uncertainty adjustment module (PRUAM). This novel component transforms original textual prompts into semantic uncertainty-aware descriptions, particularly focusing on the ambiguous boundaries prevalent in remote sensing imagery. By incorporating semantic uncertainty, SUAS directly tackles the inherent complexities in boundary delineation, enabling more refined segmentations. Experimental results demonstrate SUAS&#39;s effectiveness, showing improvements over existing methods across multiple metrics. SUAS achieves consistent enhancements in mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) and precision at various thresholds, with notable performance in handling objects with irregular and complex boundaries—a persistent challenge in aerial imagery analysis. The results indicate that SUAS&#39;s plug-and-play design, which leverages semantic uncertainty to guide the segmentation task, contributes to improved boundary delineation accuracy in remote sensing image analysis.},

This paper proposes a novel tri-plane dynamic neural radiation field (Tri-NeRF) that employs an implicit radiation field to study the impacts of audio on facial movements. Specifically, Tri-NeRF propose tri-plane offset network (TPO-Net) to offset spatial positions in three 2D planes guided by audio. This allows for sufficient learning of audio features from image features in a low dimensional state to generate more accurate lip movements. In order to better preserve facial texture details, we innovatively propose a new gated attention fusion module (GAF) to dynamically fuse features based on strong and weak correlation of cross-modal features.

In this paper, the FSA-Net head pose estimation network is enhanced to FSA-Shared_Nadam by replacing the Adam optimizer with Nadam and improving stage fusion. In the first stage, FSA-Shared_Nadam estimates head pose angles, MediaPipe detects facial landmarks to calculate eye distance and aspect ratios, and sharpness is calculated using the Laplacian operator. Images are considered valid if they meet the criteria. A model trains a face quality scoring formula, learning how different head pose angles affect face recognition accuracy. In the second stage, face images are clustered, and the formula is applied to select the highest-scoring face within each cluster.

However, in retinal fundus imaging, the reduction in image quality, characterized by poor local contrast and non-uniform brightness, is inevitable. Image enhancement becomes an essential and practical strategy to address these issues. In this paper, we propose a retinal fundus image enhancement method that emphasizes details and equalizes brightness, based on image decomposition. First, the original image is decomposed into three layers using an edge-preserving filter: a base layer, a detail layer, and a noise layer. Second, an adaptive local power-law approach is applied to the base layer for brightness equalization, while detail enhancement is achieved for the detail layer through saliency analysis and blue channel removal. Finally, the base and detail layers are combined, excluding the noise layer, to synthesize the final image. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with both classical and recent approaches using two widely adopted datasets. According to the experimental results, both subjective and objective assessments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances retinal fundus images by highlighting details, equalizing brightness, and suppressing noise and artifacts, all without causing color distortion.},

However, to further enhance the model&#39;s supervisory signals, we introduce a new feature-based perceptual loss. This module utilizes a pre-trained encoder to extract features from both the synthesized and target frames and calculates their cosine dissimilarity as an additional source of supervision. In this way, we aim to improve the model&#39;s robustness in handling complex lighting and surface reflection conditions in endoscopic scenes. We compare the performance of using two pre-trained CNN-based models and four foundational models as encoder. Experimental results show that our improve method further enhances the accuracy of depth estimation in medical imaging. Additionally, it demonstrates that features extracted by CNN-based models, which are sensitive to local details, outperform foundation models.

  abstract     = {Shadow detection helps reduce ambiguity in object detection and tracking. However, existing shadow detection methods tend to misidentify complex shadows and their similar patterns, such as soft shadow regions and shadow-like regions, since they treat all cases equally, leading to an incomplete structure of the detected shadow regions. To alleviate this issue, we propose a structure-aware transformer network (STNet) for robust shadow detection. Specifically, we first develop a transformer-based shadow detection network to learn significant contextual information interactions. To this end, a context-aware enhancement (CaE) block is also introduced into the backbone to expand the receptive field, thus enhancing semantic interaction. Then, we design an edge-guided multi-task learning framework to produce intermediate and main predictions with a rich structure. By fusing these two complementary predictions, we can obtain an edge-preserving refined shadow map. Finally, we introduce an auxiliary semantic-aware learning to overcome the interference from complex scenes, which facilitates the model to perceive shadow and non-shadow regions using a semantic affinity loss. By doing these, we can predict high-quality shadow maps in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the balance error rate (BER) by 4.53%, 2.54%, and 3.49% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the benchmark datasets SBU, ISTD, and UCF, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel model for understanding social image content through text localization. For text localization, we explore maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) for detecting components that work by clustering pixels with similar properties. The output of component detection includes several non-text components due to the degradations of social media images. To select the best components among many, we explore the genetic algorithm by convolving different kernels with components, which results in a feature matrix that is further fed to EfficientNet for choosing actual text components. Therefore, the proposed model is called genetic algorithm based network for text localization in degraded social media images (TLDSMI). For evaluating text localization, we consider the images of the standard dataset of natural scenes by uploading and downloading from different social media platforms, namely, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Instagram. The effectiveness of our method is shown by testing on original and degraded standard datasets. For example, for the degraded images of different complexities including degradations caused by social media platforms, the proposed method performs well in almost all situations. In addition, the proposed model achieves the best F1-Score, 0.76, 0.77, 0.70, and 0.78 for the degraded images of CUTE, ICDAR 2013, Total-Text, and CTW1500, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the majority of palmprint recognition studies have focused on feature extraction while neglecting security issues. Among the various attack types, spoofing attack poses a significant threat due to high success rates and minimal technical requirements. In this study, we explore the differences between real and fake palmprint images. Based on these differences, we propose the concept of ‘high-frequency spoofing regions’ to capture key discriminative spoofing clues. Specifically, the high-frequency spoofing regions adaptation ( HFSRA ) model is proposed to address palmprint anti-spoofing. The HFSRA consists of two key modules: the texture analysis module (TAM) and the spoofing attention module (SAM). In particular, the TAM divides the input feature map into several patches and evaluates the texture distribution within each patch. Next, the SAM dynamically constructs an attention map by mapping the texture distribution to an attention weight matrix. This adaptive structure forces the model to focus on high-frequency spoofing regions, which improves the model&#39;s ability to extract meaningful spoofing clues effectively. Furthermore, we establish three experimental protocols for evaluating the performance of palmprint anti-spoofing models. These protocols provide a standardized evaluation framework for future studies. Extensive experiments conducted under these protocols demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of HFSRA.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved generative adversarial network. Specifically, an enhanced multi-scale Laplacian pyramid structure is designed to capture and process image details at different scales. Then, convolutional operations are added to each layer of the pyramid to further improve the recovery of multi-scale details. Additionally, a frequency domain loss is introduced, where the generated and real images are transformed into the frequency domain using Fourier transforms for comparison. This method enhances the reconstruction of high-frequency details. The experiments are validated on four publicly available datasets and the results show that the proposed network significantly outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and visual performance.},

To address the problems, we propose a novel YOLO framework called SF-YOLO for small object detection. Firstly, we present a spatial information perception (SIP) module to extract contextual features for different objects through the integration of space to depth operation and large selective kernel module, which dynamically adjusts receptive field of the backbone and obtains the enhanced features for richer understanding of differentiation between objects and background. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-scale feature weighted fusion strategy, which performs weighted fusion on feature maps by combining fast normalized fusion method and CARAFE operation, accurately assessing the importance of each feature and enhancing the representation of small objects. The extensive experiments conducted on VisDrone2019, Tiny-Person and PESMOD datasets demonstrate that our proposed method enables comparable detection performance to state-of-the-art detectors.},

To address these, we propose a deformable attention network for efficient STVSR. Specifically, we introduce a deformable interpolation block that employs hierarchical feature fusion to effectively handle complex inter-frame motions at multiple scales, enabling more accurate intermediate frame generation. To fully utilise temporal information, we design a temporal feature shuffle block (TFSB) to efficiently exchange complementary information across multiple frames. Additionally, we develop a motion feature enhancement block incorporating channel attention mechanism to selectively emphasise motion-related features, further boosting TFSB&#39;s effectiveness.

This paper proposes a robust text watermarking method based on the stroke components of Chinese characters. By designing an innovative approach, Chinese character strokes are divided into several distinct components, with only specific ones being selectively modified to generate new glyphs, thus forming a unique codebook. The watermark signals are embedded by substituting the carrier glyph with the newly generated one, and the signals are extracted using a template matching method. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional manually designed codebooks, the proposed method significantly reduces human labor and computational overhead while maintaining high visual quality. Moreover, it exhibits superior robustness and adaptability across various challenging scenarios, including digital noise attacks, print-scanning attacks, and print-camera capture, making it a highly effective solution for protecting textual information.},

  abstract     = {In coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) systems, deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have made significant strides in recovering 3D hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single 2D measurement. However, the inherent nonlinearity and ill-posed nature of HSI reconstruction continue to challenge existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight collaborative attention-enhanced accelerated unfolding network ( ), which integrates a DUN framework with a streamlined prior extractor. Our integrated approach introduces a generically accelerated half-quadratic splitting algorithm (A-HQS) for degradation estimation, overcoming the limitations of first-order optimization and enabling effective long-range dependency modeling. Within the prior extractor, we introduce cross-convergence attention, facilitating iterative information exchange between local and non-local Transformers to capture holistic features and enhance inductive capacity. Notably, the concept of collaborative cross-convergence is embedded throughout all submodules, ensuring effective information flow. The proposed not only accelerates the convergence of spectral reconstruction, but also fully exploits compressed spatial-spectral information. Numerical and visual comparisons on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this approach. Comparisons on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate the superiority of this approach. The source code is available at https://github.com/Mengjie-s/CA2UN .},

Initially, a method to extend the maximum fitting FOV of the camera model to over 180 degrees is proposed. Subsequently, a calibration board detection approach is proposed using SE(3) image pre-correction. Specifically, image pre-correction is incorporated into the camera calibration process, utilizing SE(3) to define the pre-correction plane. Calibration boards are detected within the pre-corrected images, enhancing the reliability, accuracy and speed of board detection in distorted images, consequently increasing the control point&#39;s maximum FOV. Lastly, the improved camera model and SE(3) image pre-correction are integrated into a feedback-based camera calibration system for ultra-wide FOV fisheye cameras. Operating with real-time or offline video streams as input, this system autonomously selects calibration key frames, optimizes camera parameters and calibration board poses in real-time.

An algorithm is proposed to tackle this challenge by employing customizable shape fitting. This method begins with the extraction of sub-pixel edge points, followed by applying a Hough transform to group and smooth these points, thereby enhancing contour quality. By parameterizing the target shape based on specific points, the algorithm integrates sub-pixel traversal techniques with an optimization objective, achieving sub-pixel accuracy in centre positioning. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm can achieve a positioning accuracy of ±0.03 pixels and demonstrates robustness against noise and blur. Finally, the proposed algorithm was used to test the OVL target pair arrays fabricated by electron beam etching, confirming an accuracy of ±0.04 pixels (±6.9 nm).

To address this issue, we propose a two-step refinement method for image segmentation, comprising region expansion and minor contour adjustments. First, we design an adaptive gradient thresholding module to provide gradient-based constraints for the refinement process. Next, the region expansion module iteratively refines each segmented region based on colour differences and gradient thresholds. Finally, the minor contour adjustments module leverages local strong gradient features to refine the contour positions further. This method integrates region-level and pixel-level information to refine various image segmentation results. This method was applied to the BSDS500, Cells, and WHU Building datasets. The results demonstrate that the refined closed contours align more closely with the ground truth, with the most notable improvement observed at contour inflection points (corner points). Among the results, the Cells dataset showed the most significant improvement in segmentation accuracy, with the F-score increasing from 87.51% to 89.73% and IoU from 86.83% to 88.40%.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal diagnosis of ophthalmic disease is becoming increasingly important because combining multi-modal data allows for more accurate diagnosis. Color fundus photograph (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are commonly used as two non-invasive modalities for ophthalmic examination. However, the diagnosis of each modality is not entirely accurate. Compounding the challenge is the difficulty in acquiring multi-modal data, with existing datasets frequently lacking paired multi-modal data. To solve these problems, we propose multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm and cross-modal generation algorithm. The multi-modal distribution fusion diagnostic algorithm first calculates the mean and variance separately for each modality, and then generates multi-modal diagnostic results in a distribution fusion manner. In order to generate the absent modality (mainly OCT data), three sub-networks are designed in the cross-modal generation algorithm: cross-modal alignment network, conditional deformable autoencoder and latent consistency diffusion model (LCDM). Finally, we propose multi-task collaboration strategy where diagnosis and generation tasks are mutually reinforcing to achieve optimal performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method yield superior results compared to state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {Local binary patterns (LBP) play a vital role in image classification as a computationally efficient feature descriptor. A crucial reason for its limitation of discriminability is the lack of neighbourhood information description from a global perspective. Previous research has attempted to improve its performance by introducing global thresholds, but such threshold selection is not optimal. To address this issue, we propose a novel tomography-aided local binary patterns (TLBP), inspired by the tomographic process of sample separation. TLBP considers constructing visual feature representations under multi-level non-local information to compensate for the lack of LBP possessing only a single shallow feature. In addition to the basic LBP features from local visual context, TLBP captures refined neighbourhood greyscale information through multi-quantile thresholds from a global visual perspective, thereby greatly enhancing discriminability. Experimental results in texture classification, face recognition, and hyperspectral pixel-wise classification demonstrate that the proposed TLBP descriptor outperforms the competitors, achieving 94.39% (KTH-TIPS), 81.22% (KTH-TIPS-ROT), 93.81% (Indian Pines), 99.85% (Salinas), and 99.50% (ORL) accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of the T-variants that apply the tomographic idea to classic LBP descriptors improve significantly, especially for their rotation-invariant versions.},

This fragment describes a compression transformation and an excitation transformation that captures the differentiated feature representation of the command. These transformations facilitate the network&#39;s ability to locate and predict the location of small objects more accurately. Utilizing these transformations enhances the expressiveness and diversity of features, thereby improving the detection performance of small objects. Furthermore, data augmentation and hyperparameter optimization techniques are employed to enhance the model&#39;s generalisability. The validation results on the Argoverse 1.1 autonomous driving dataset demonstrate that the enhanced network model outperforms the prevailing detectors, achieving an F1 score of 78.6, an average precision of 55.1, and an average recall of 72.4.

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image target detection provides an effective and accurate data analysis tool for many application areas. Due to complex backgrounds, large differences in target scales, and missed detection of small targets, remote sensing image target detection is challenging. In order to enhance the model&#39;s understanding of the global information of remote sensing images, this paper proposes the GFA module. This module can establish the global contextual connection of remote sensing images to provide rich context to help understand the complex scene and background in which the target is located, without being limited to local information. Additionally, it focuses on channel information for enhanced target feature extraction. For the purpose of alleviating the serious imbalance in foreground–background samples that is present in single-level target detection models. The loss function is reconstructed based on focal loss by redefining the balance factor α and focus factor γ , so that it can be dynamically adjusted during network training. Meanwhile, EIoU is used to further enhance the bounding box regression capability. Affine transformations were also used to augment the dataset in order to assist the model in adjusting to real-world situations. The proposed method is experimentally validated on the publicly available HRRSD dataset. In comparison with YOLO v5, the mAP of the detection results improved by 2.7%. Compared with YOLO v8 and YOLO v10, the mAP improved by 3.2% and 3.3%. The model achieves an FPS of 40.1, an optimal balance between speed and accuracy. Further, experiments are conducted using the NWPU VHR-10 dataset and the RSOD dataset, both of which demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms other target detection methods and improves remote sensing target detection performance.},

The GSA-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture, which extracts spatial structure information from images and identifies different objects using the minimum spanning tree algorithm. The network&#39;s encoder extracts multi-scale image features with the help of an effective and lightweight channel attention module. The decoder then transforms these features bottom-up using tree filter modules. Combined with the boundary detection module, the segmentation performance can be further improved. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two liver MRI benchmarks: one with respiratory artifacts and the other without. Numerical evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that GSA-Net consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of segmentation precision on our respiratory artifact dataset, and also achieves notable results on high-quality datasets.},

However, in previous works, the negatives are sampled from the input image itself, which inspires us to design a data augmentation method to improve the quality of the selected negatives. Moreover, the previous methods only preserve the content consistency via patch-wise contrastive learning, which ignores the domain consistency between the generated images and the real images of the target domain. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised i2i translation framework based on multi-cropping contrastive learning and domain consistency, called MCDUT. Specifically, the multi-cropping views are obtained with the aim of further generating high-quality negative examples. To constrain the embeddings in the deep feature space, a new domain consistency loss is formulated, which encourages the generated images to be close to the real images. In many i2i translation tasks, this method achieves state-of-the-art results, and the advantages of this method have been proven through extensive comparison experiments and ablation research.

  abstract     = {Image restoration poses a significant challenge, aiming to accurately recover damaged images by delving into their inherent characteristics. Various models and algorithms have been explored by researchers to address different types of image distortions, including sparse representation, grouped sparse representation, and low-rank self-representation. The grouped sparse representation algorithm leverages the prior knowledge of non-local self-similarity and imposes sparsity constraints to maintain texture information within images. To further exploit the intrinsic properties of images, this study proposes a novel low-rank representation-guided grouped sparse representation image restoration algorithm. This algorithm integrates self-representation models and trace optimization techniques to effectively preserve the original image structure, thereby enhancing image restoration performance while retaining the original texture and structural information. The proposed method was evaluated on image denoising and deblocking tasks across several datasets, demonstrating promising results.},

  abstract     = {Processing facial images with varying poses is a significant challenge. Most existing face frontalization methods rely on heavy architectures that struggle with small datasets and produce low-quality images. Additionally, although video frames provide richer information, these methods typically use single images due to the lack of suitable multi-image datasets. To address these issues, a parameter-efficient framework for high-quality face frontalization in both single and multi-frame scenarios is proposed. First, a high-quality, diverse dataset is created for single and multi-image face frontalization tasks. Second, a novel single-image face frontalization method is introduced by combining GAN inversion with transfer learning. This approach reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 91% compared to existing GAN inversion methods while achieving far more photorealistic results than GAN-based methods. Finally, this method is extended to sequences of images, using attention mechanisms to merge information from multiple frames. This multi-frame approach reduces artefacts like eye blinks and improves reconstruction quality. Experiments demonstrate that this single-image method outperforms pSp, a state-of-the-art GAN inversion method, with a 0.15 LPIPS improvement and a 0.10 increase in ID similarity. This multi-frame approach further improves identity preservation to 0.87, showcasing its effectiveness for high-quality frontal-view reconstructions.},

However, most methods do not achieve satisfactory results because of the influence of background dynamics and other factors. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) background modeling method is a popular and powerful motion background modeling technology owing to its ability to balance robustness and real-time constraints in various practical environments. However, when the background is complex and the target moves slowly, the traditional GMM cannot accurately detect the target and is prone to misjudging the moving background as a moving target. To address the interference from complex backgrounds, this study proposes a target detection method that combines an adaptive GMM with an improved three-frame difference method, along with an algorithm that combines grayscale statistics with an improved Phong illumination model for illumination compensation and shadow removal. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved method has better robustness, improves target detection accuracy, and reduces noise and background interference.},

Four single-flow continuous fermenters were used for rumen culture incubation with four different treatment diets: Control (50:50 forage to concentrate [F:C] ratio), Control + Bromoform (CBR), Low Forage (LF; 20:80), and High Forage (HF; 80:20). After 10 days of incubation, all fermenter contents were transferred and used in a 24 h ANKOM batch culture to measure gas production with LMD and OGI. The authors introduce the Controlled Diet (CD) dataset, a large-scale collection of 4,885 plume images captured using an FLIR GF77 OGI camera under varying dietary conditions. The performance of six semantic segmentation models (FCN, U-Net, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, DeepLabv3+, and Gasformer) on the CD dataset is compared. Results showed that LMD data for followed a similar pattern to the gas chromatography (GC) instrument results. The in vitro results showed that different diets and F:C ratios had an impact on gas production and rumen fermentation characteristics. Adding bromoform to the control diet fully inhibited emission. The HF diet produced more compared to all treatments ( ) when measured with GC and LMD. CBR produced the lowest values when measured with GC and LMD. The Gasformer architecture achieved the highest performance with mean IoU of 85.1% and mean F-score of 91.72%. These findings demonstrate that OGI technology combined with advanced semantic segmentation models offers a promising solution for predicting and quantifying emissions in the livestock sector, potentially aiding in the development of mitigation strategies to combat climate change.},

To address the issue of dominant features being suppressed during feature fusion in FER, this study proposes a self-learning weight network based on label distribution training (SLW-LDT). First, based on the ShuffleNet-V2 backbone model, SLW-LDT introduced a local feature extraction branch that highlights specific expression-related features by cropping the facial image into four local regions. Subsequently, the SLW algorithm is devised to allocate learnable weights to global and local features from different branches before their fusion. Moreover, considering the challenge associated with accessing emotional distribution in facial images directly, a label distribution training module (LDT) is introduced during the training phase to generate label distributions for effective training purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracies of 89.77% and 64.21% on two in-the-wild datasets (RAF-DB and AffectNet-7), and 98.90% on the lab-controlled CK+ dataset. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods reveals slight improvements in recognition accuracy along with robust performance exhibited by the model.},

Firstly, OLODN employs FasterNet blocks and reparameterised generalised-FPN to reduce computational complexity and preserve feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Secondly, a reinforced coordination attention mechanism is designed to strengthen the network&#39;s ability to capture occlusion boundary information. Additionally, a spatial pyramid pooling feature concatenation module is introduced to integrate multi-scale features and enhance the algorithm&#39;s robustness to occlusions.

Despite extensive research on morphing detection, limited attention has been given to restoring accomplice face images, which is critical for forensic applications. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel face de-morphing (FD) method based on identity feature transfer for restoring accomplice face images. The method encodes facial attribute and identity features separately and employs cross-attention mechanisms to extract identity features from morphed faces relative to reference images. This process isolates and enhances the accomplice&#39;s identity features. Additionally, inverse linear interpolation is applied to transfer identity features to attribute features, further refining the restoration process. The enhanced identity features are then integrated with the StyleGAN generator to reconstruct high-quality accomplice facial images. Experimental evaluations on two morphed face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, improving the average restoration accuracy by at least 5% compared with other methods. These findings highlight the potential of this approach for advancing forensic and security applications.},

Recently, due to the rise and widespread use of spike cameras, learning optical flow from spiking cameras has become a hot topic in the field of two-dimensional motion estimation. Although existing methods have been designed to learn optical flow by designing feature processing methods for spike streams, there is still insufficient consideration for flow field post-processing, resulting in limited accuracy of optical flow estimation. To address this problem, an optical flow estimation method based on directional disassembly is proposed. Specifically, the estimated flow fields along the horizontal and vertical directions are disassembled and the motion vectors along the two directions are denoised separately to reduce the burden of post-processing for complex two-dimensional motion information. In addition, contextual information is introduced in the post-processing so that the scene information can effectively contribute to the results of the flow post-processing.

Moreover, the model&#39;s effectiveness is validated through extensive comparison experiments.

In response, a small target detection algorithm that fuses multi-scale complementary features, named MCFNet is proposed. Firstly, in order to independently extract the unimodal features of visible light and infrared images and effectively enhance the complementary information between images, a dual-stream backbone network with a terminal fusion mechanism is proposed. Secondly, the complementary feature information residual module is utilized to optimize the integration process of residual features. Subsequently, by designing a multi-scale feature enhancement module the network&#39;s capability to capture multi-scale features is enhanced. Finally, for targets of varying sizes, a lightweight Transformer feature extraction module is proposed to improve the detection accuracy of small targets from a drone&#39;s perspective. Test results on the drone-vehicle dataset show that this method achieved an average detection accuracy of 67.92%, while the detection accuracy on the self-constructed UAV-data dataset reached 96.4%.

  abstract     = {As one of the world&#39;s most popular beverages, tea plays a significant role in improving tea production efficiency and quality through the identification of tea shoots during the tea manufacturing process. However, due to the complex morphology, small size, and susceptibility to factors like lighting and obstruction, traditional identification methods suffer from low accuracy and efficiency. In this study, image enhancement techniques such as HSV transformation, horizontal flipping, and vertical flipping were applied to the training dataset to improve model robustness and enhance generalization across varying lighting and angles. To address these challenges in the context of tea buds detection, deep-learning-based object detection methods have emerged as promising solutions. Nevertheless, current object detection technologies still face limitations when detecting tea buds under these conditions. To enhance identification performance, this article proposed an improved YOLOv5s (You Only Look Once version 5 small model) algorithm. In the improved YOLOv5s algorithm, CBAM, SE, and CA attention mechanisms were incorporated into the backbone network to augment feature extraction, and a weighted Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is employed in the neck network to boost performance, resulting in the YOLOv5s_teabuds model. Experimental results indicated that the improved model significantly outperformed the original in terms of precision, recall, mAP and F1-score, with the CA attention mechanism providing the most notable improvement—enhancing precision, recall, mAP and F1-score by 18.119%, 9.633%, 16.496% and 13.524%, respectively. After integrating BiFPN, the YOLOv5s_teabuds model further strengthened performance and robustness, with precision, recall, mAP and F1-score increased by 19.346%, 11.388%, 18.620%, and 15.059%, respectively. Experimental results prove that the optimized YOLOv5s model can provide a real-time, high-precision tea buds detection method for robotic harvesting.},

  abstract     = {Images can be corrupted during capture or transmission due to clouds, overlaps, and other interferences, deviating from their original state. Image inpainting techniques restore such images, but different types—Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), RGB, and infrared—require varying field-of-view sizes. SAR and infrared images, with less information, need a larger field of view, leading to uncorrelated interference in distant areas. RGB images, richer in information, are constrained by a limited local field of view, hindering access to full semantic details. To address these challenges, an aggregated convolution progressive network is proposed. This model employs a coarse-grained inpainting module for initial restoration, enhanced by an aggregated convolution module to capture contextual information. Local and global details are then used to refine the output, improving restoration quality. Additionally, existing datasets predominantly focus on RGB images, lacking diversity. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive dataset covering SAR, RGB, and infrared images under cloud, overlap, and corruption conditions is constructed. This method achieves superior performance, with MAE of 0.05, SSIM of 0.95, and PSNR of 36.68 within a 20–30% mask size range, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across diverse image types and size ranges. Experimental results validate its effectiveness in advancing image inpainting.},

The algorithm extracts the feature points of the infrared image and the visible image through the principle of phase agreement and the edge binary map of the image and then calculates the descriptors of the gradient images of the infrared image and the visible image, and the descriptor calculation draws on some SIFT principles. Finally, the cosine similarity was used to match the feature points, and the improved random sample consensus algorithm was used to screen out the correct registration points. Experiments show that this method can effectively register between infrared and visible images and is also suitable for the registration of infrared and visible images with different rotation angles and similar structures.},

However, this task is hindered by the limited availability of annotated data. This study proposes a novel semi-supervised learning framework, co-teacher-guided pseudo-label supervision (CTGP), to address this challenge. CTGP combines co-training and the Mean-Teacher strategy, where predictions generated by teacher models are filtered and utilized as high-quality pseudo-labels to train the other student models, thus facilitating co-training. Additionally, a medical image-specific augmentation method, MIAugment, is introduced to better adapt to the unique characteristics of medical data. Experiments on a real-life clinical dataset demonstrate that CTGP achieves high segmentation accuracy with minimal labelled data. Using only 10% of labelled data, the framework achieves a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.03% for four tissue types, a decrease of just 2.85% compared to fully supervised learning. This approach provides a promising solution for automated muscle and adipose tissue segmentation with limited annotations.},

Traditional text-guided attention-based methods have achieved better results than baselines, but it is argued that there is still potential for improvement in the area of multi-modal fusion. Thus, Mono3DVG-TRv2, an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that employs a visual-text multi-modal encoder for the alignment and fusion of multi-modal features, incorporating an enhanced transformer module proven in 2D detection, is introduced. The depth features predicted by the multi-modal features and the visual-text features are associated with the learnable queries in the decoder, facilitating more efficient and effective acquisition of geometric information in intricate scenes.

  abstract     = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial target detection tasks, two main challenges exist: the limited computational resources of UAV terminals, which are not conducive to running complex models, and the prevalence of small targets, which can easily lead to missed detections and false positives. To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight and high-accuracy small-object detection algorithm for UAV aerial imagery that is based on YOLOv5s. First, the network structure is optimized by removing the layers in YOLOv5s primarily used for detecting large targets (P4 and P5) and adding layers primarily used for detecting small targets (P2 and P3). This enables the model to focus more on extracting small-object features. A lightweight dynamic convolution is subsequently introduced in the C3 module, and the lightweight LW_C3 and LW_downsampling modules are designed for feature extraction and downsampling operations. This enhances the model&#39;s feature extraction capability while achieving a lightweight design. Finally, the adaptive multi-scale spatial feature fusion (AMSFF) module is designed to adaptively learn the spatial weights of the feature maps at different levels, thereby further strengthening the effective fusion of multi-scale features. Experimental results show that the improved YOLO-Tiny model has higher accuracy and lower complexity, hence validating its excellent performance.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image super-resolution by addressing issues such as transition smoothing, insufficient high-frequency information, and training instability encountered in regression-based and GAN-based models. However, challenges persist when applying diffusion models to image super-resolution, including randomness, inadequate conditional information, high computational costs, and network architecture complexities. In this article, the authors introduce a diffusion model based on Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE), and propose the use of ENAFBlocks instead of traditional ResBlocks to enhance model performance in noise prediction. The Mean-Reverting SDE effectively mitigates the randomness of the diffusion model by leveraging low-resolution images as means. Additionally, an LR Encoder is introduced to capture hidden information from LR images, providing a more robust condition for stable result generation by the noise predictor. To efficiently handle high-resolution images within limited GPU memory, the method employs adaptive aggregate sampling, which merges overlapping regions smoothly using weighted averaging. Furthermore, color variations are addressed during diffusion model sampling through color correction. Extensive experiments on CelebA, DIV2K, and Urban100 demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models like IDM, with a PSNR improvement of 0.22 dB, FID reduction of 2.35, and LPIPS reduction of 0.05 on the DIV2K dataset, along with a reduced parameter count and faster inference time.},

Most of the previous research on multimodal fusion is single-stage fusion, disregarding how various modality subsets interact, as well as rarely considering relative position relationship of modality sequences, causing the fragmentation of context info. Considering the aforementioned issues, this study introduces an MSA method based on the multi-stage graph fusion network (MSGFN) under random missing modality conditions to improve the robustness of the model to MSA under the random missing modality conditions. Firstly, for each modality, its inter-modal and intra-modal multi-head attention are used to learn robust representation of the modality sequence. Meanwhile, the relative position encoding (RPE) is introduced into mechanism of attention that enables model to perceive and learn the relative position before and after the modality sequence when calculating attention, thereby better understanding the contextual info of the sequence. After that, the transformer encoder receives the learned modality features and uses the pre-trained model to supervise the reconstruction of the missing modality information. Finally, the feature representations of different modalities have effectively fused using multi-stage graph fusion network, and the output is used for the ultimate sentiment classification. Wide experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets, CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP, and the findings indicate that the proposed method can better handle the challenges caused by modality fusion and modality missing compared with several baseline methods.},

To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a multi-class anomaly detection model: UniRD, based on the reverse distillation method. This model creates an image corruptor that expands the dataset and generates ‘normal-corrupt’ image pairs. During the training process, their correspondence is used to optimize the reverse distillation. This process greatly exploits and releases the potential of the student decoder. Furthermore, a teacher feature adaptation module is devised to enhance the compatibility between the pre-trained model and the anomaly detection task. This has the effect of reducing the discrepancy between teacher and student features while ensuring the consistency of normal sample features. The comprehensive evaluation results in two mainstream datasets, MVTec and VisA, and demonstrates that the proposed method exhibits improvement in all indicators compared to benchmark methods.

The presence of occlusion in a scene is primarily attributed to variations in viewpoint and access time, thereby posing a significant challenge in accurately predicting scene flow. In the endeavour to mitigate this issue, the focus is on the propagation of scene flow originating from non-occluded points towards occlusion points while concurrently estimating the occlusion map.

Image classified as normal by CNN-J is not processed, while the classified noisy image is denoised. In the denoising process, a marking image and a rough denoised image are generated by CNN for noise mask (CNN-M) and CNN for denoising (CNN-D), respectively. Subsequently, the refined denoised image is output using the proposed refining mechanism. The middle layers of CNN-M and CNN-D are constructed by depth-separable CNN to reduce the network complexity. Experimental results show that the misjudging rate of CNN-M marking is reduced by 19.94% compared with the best existing marking method. Compared with the traditional methods, the peak signal to noise ratio of the proposed method is increased by 2.95% and the information loss is reduced by 21.46%.

This paper proposes a diagonal distance loss function, L DDIoU ${\mathcal {L}_{\text{DDIoU}}}$ , and a combined diagonal distance loss function, L CDIoU ${\mathcal {L}_{\text{CDIoU}}}$ , based IoU. These functions use the distance between diagonals as a penalty, overcoming the degradation phenomenon of prior functions based on traditional IoU. The altered loss functions are also integrated into faster R-CNN and SSD models, and their effectiveness is assessed on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO and SSDD data sets, yielding favourable results. This paper also extends the IoU calculation between two boxes when performing non-maximum suppression to advance position precision.

The complexity of pest and disease object in the field, combined with inconsistent features across different levels, poses challenges for network detection. Additionally, the complex agricultural production environment tends to generate many interfering negative samples, which significantly complicates pest and disease differentiation. To address these two issues, the YOLOv7-PSAFP network structure was first proposed. Based on YOLOV7, the progressive Spatial Adaptive Feature Pyramid (PSAFP) was introduced. Second, a combination of the Varifocal Loss and Loss Rank Mining loss functions was used for calculating the object loss, which reduces the interference of useless negative examples during training. On the filtered-plant-village-dataset and rice-corn pest dataset, the mAP results of YOLOv7-PSAFP were 84.7 and 93.3 , which are 2.9 and 2.1 higher than the baseline model (YOLOv7), respectively.

For these reasons, Remote-Sensing Single-Image Super-Resolution (RS-SISR) techniques have gained significant interest. In this paper, Swin2-MoSE model is proposed, an enhanced version of Swin2SR. The model introduces MoE-SM, an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to replace the Feed-Forward inside all Transformer block. MoE-SM is designed with Smart-Merger, and new layer for merging the output of individual experts, and with a new way to split the work between experts, defining a new per-example strategy instead of the commonly used per-token one. Furthermore, it is analyzed how positional encodings interact with each other, demonstrating that per-channel bias and per-head bias can positively cooperate. Finally, the authors propose to use a combination of Normalized-Cross-Correlation (NCC) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) losses, to avoid typical MSE loss limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that Swin2-MoSE outperforms any Swin derived models by up to 0.377–0.958 dB (PSNR) on task of , and resolution-upscaling ( and OLI2MSI datasets). It also outperforms SOTA models by a good margin, proving to be competitive and with excellent potential, especially for complex tasks. Additionally, an analysis of computational costs is also performed. Finally, the efficacy of Swin2-MoSE is shown, applying it to a semantic segmentation task (SeasoNet dataset).

However, these approaches are expensive and require more time for image quality analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust and computationally efficient objective-mathematical model based on statistical perceptual features. The structural and textural features are computed using the modified regularized heaviside local binary pattern (RH-LBP) approach and the concept of entropy. The higher-order probability coefficients of images are considered to extract features that are highly correlated to the human visual system features. Further, the additivity property of Renyi entropy is used to show the randomness of the information combining two terms: One extracts the images spatial intensity changes, and therefore their texture qualities, and the other attain structural details. The features in the proposed approach are jointly optimized to achieve better robustness, monotonicity and match human assessments on image quality, while minimizing the computational complexity and run time. Experiments are conducted with three synthetically distorted datasets, KonIQ-10K, BIQ2021, and LIVE (wild), and two intentionally distorted datasets, TID2013 and CSIQ and are used to evaluate performance index.

This study addresses challenges in rice field images, such as environmental variability and differences in rice leaf sizes.

An 18-layer ResNet model was trained using ground truth leaf width values for regression in leaf width estimation. Experiments used a dataset of 4960 images representing 8 rice diseases. The leaf width prediction model achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 11.18% and was used to generate a tiled dataset for training advanced rice disease detection models. The tiling technique was evaluated using YOLOv4, YOLOv8n, YOLOv8l, DINO-5scale Swin-L, and Co-DINO-5scale Swin-L models by comparing detection performance on original and tiled datasets. Mean average precision improved significantly: YOLOv4 increased from 87.56% to91.14%, YOLOv8n from 89.80% to 91.70%, and YOLOv8l from 89.80% to 93.20%. More advanced models, such as DINO5scale Swin-L and Co-DINO-5scale Swin-L, achieved even higher precision, at 93.40% and 94.20%, respectively.

  abstract     = {The detection of road potholes plays a crucial role in ensuring passenger comfort and the structural safety of vehicles. To address the challenges of pothole detection in complex road environments, this paper proposes a model focusing on shape features (pothole detection you only look once, PD-YOLO). The model aims to overcome the limitations of multi-scale feature learning caused by the use of fixed convolutional kernels in the baseline model, by constructing a feature extraction module that better adapts to variations in the shape of potholes. Subsequently, a cross-stage partial network was designed using a one-time aggregation method, simplifying the model while enabling the network to fuse information between feature maps at different stages. Additionally, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism is introduced to select relevant features, reducing redundancy and suppressing background noise. Experiments conducted on the VOC2007 and GRDDC2020_Pothole datasets reveal that compared to the baseline model YOLOv8, PD-YOLO achieves improvements of 3.9% and 2.8% in mean average precision, with a frame rate of approximately 290 frames per second, effectively meeting the accuracy and real-time requirements for pothole detection.

First, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) with geometric transformations is designed, which uses rotated labels as supervision to obtain lower-level characteristics that more accurately capture various orientations and then makes use of a spectral-spatial characteristic extraction network to maximize the utilization of HSI&#39;s spectrum and spatial information. Next, a class anchor open-set classification module based on a twin clustering network is designed, which uses SCL and FSL to extract more specific personal information by mining the category-invariant characteristics present in the known versus unknown class data. Finally, multiple convolution and open-set recognition (OSC) is performed on the feature blocks. Experimental results on three classical HSI datasets show that FSSCL-OSC provides a significant improvement over existing methods, under a sample size of only 10%, the overall accuracy reached 82.38%, 90.76% and 84.70%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Compared with common urban landscape semantic segmentation, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image semantic segmentation is more challenging because small targets have very low pixel percentages and multi-scale features due to the influence of flight altitude. Yet, the commonly used successive grid downsampling strategy in the current transformer-based methods omits some important features of small targets. Furthermore, due to the complex background interference, it can lead to even worse results. In reaction to this, existing strategies aim to maintain superior resolution. Nevertheless, the application of this method incurs considerable computational costs, which brings challenges for the practical applications of UAVs. So it is significant to design a novel framework to balance retaining more pixels representing small objects during downsampling and reducing computational costs. For this, the Channel Selection and the Local Attention Transformer Model (CSLFormer) are proposed. During the overlap patch embedding process of feature maps, the model allocates half of the important channels to global attention and local attention. These two types of attention focus on different aspects: one learns the relationships and importance among various patches, while the other emphasizes the features of individual patches. The method shows superior performance on two public datasets: AeroScapes and Vaihingen, achieving mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 75.57% and 78.93%, respectively.

This distortion bends straight lines into curves, resulting in a barrel-shaped appearance of the image. To mitigate these effects and transform fisheye images into a regular perspective, fisheye image correction is necessary, enabling more accurate and reliable performance in applications like object recognition, 3D reconstruction, and visual navigation. While convolutional neural networks based fisheye image correction has progressed, it has not fully utilized the global distribution and local symmetry of distortions due to the limitations of fixed receptive fields. This paper introduces a new model based on the Swin Transformer that effectively utilizes both global and local distortion features to adapt automatically to fisheye lens distortions.

To advance towards an autonomous model for detailed polyp segmentation, the authors propose a new framework for polyp segmentation called U-shaped cross-fusion network with attention mechanism (UCFA-Net), which employs a pyramid vision transformer as encoder to extract image features at multiple scales. Furthermore, the multi-scale cross-fusion module cross-fuses the different scale features and then goes through the multi-scale convolutional parallel feedforward transformer module for modelling the global and local information. Finally, progressive attentional up-sampling module acts as a decoder for up-sampling with progressive attention to get the final polyp segmentation result.

Ultrasound imaging is often the initial diagnostic test for gallbladder cancer, making the enhancement of cancer detection accuracy from these images crucial.

Therefore, it is essential not to rely solely on a single model&#39;s output and to further investigate for more reliable outcomes. This study presents a step-by-step structural investigation of forming an end-to-end model, a conjunction of two convolutional neural network based methods, for detecting gallbladder conditions.

It also achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.36% for classifying normal and non-normal instances and 92.22% for classifying benign and malignant cases. Finally, comprehensive post-processing investigations, including cross-validation, temperature scaling, and uncertainty estimation, along with error analysis, are conducted to gain more insights into the model&#39;s output. Among these insights, the model demonstrated resilience of its results to active dropout and augmentation at the inference phase. Furthermore, when applied with test-time data augmentation, uncertainty estimation methods have better distinguishability between the uncertainties of correctly and incorrectly classified instances, which provides additional information about the model&#39;s output.

  abstract     = {Automated segmentation of mitochondria is crucial for statistical analysis in biological research. Existing segmentation techniques often face challenges with fluorescence images. Handcrafted methods have poor segmentation results while deep learning-based methods lack the labeled mitochondrial data. However, although the number of labeled mitochondrial images is limited, the unlabeled fluorescent data is easy to obtain. The authors aim to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to learn mitochondrial morphological features. The approach begins with self-supervised learning from a vast set of unlabeled images through masked image modeling. This technique involves presenting images with randomly masked patches, prompting the model to predict the content of these masked areas. By doing so, the model learns the distinctive features of mitochondria. In the subsequent phase, the trained encoder is transferred to the segmentation task, replacing the original reconstruction decoder with the Segformer segmentation decoder. The model is then fine-tuned using a small labeled dataset. By reconstructing mitochondria in the masked regions, the model learns features more effectively on unlabeled samples, and improves segmentation performance even with limited labeled data. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing an 11.8% improvement in Intersection over Union metrics compared to existing fluorescence mitochondrial segmentation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Early diagnosis of brain tumors significantly enhances treatment success. However, accurate detection and segmentation of tumors, essential for diagnosis, rely heavily on costly manual annotation by experts. To mitigate these costs, weakly supervised methods have gained traction. This paper introduces a novel weakly supervised brain tumor segmentation approach utilizing point and scribble supervision. Experts annotate only the slice with the largest tumor area by marking a single point near the tumor center or drawing a scribble within the tumor region. The method operates in two phases. First, labels are propagated to unlabelled pixels, generating a pseudo-ground-truth with three labels: tumor, non-tumor, and marginal pixels (unlabelled pixels surrounding the initial segmentation). Second, a segmentation model is trained using the pseudo-ground-truth and a loss function combining level-set and binary cross-entropy losses. Marginal pixels contribute to level-set loss computation, refining the segmentation process. The approach is validated on 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes from BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show Dice scores comparable to fully supervised methods for whole tumor segmentation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed weakly supervised strategy. This method reduces annotation effort while maintaining competitive segmentation performance, making it valuable for clinical applications.},

Furthermore, a multi-scale feature fusion layer based on residual connection is introduced to extract more comprehensive and richer disease features at different scales. Finally, by introducing the double pooling method, the overall feature distribution is smoothed while highlighting the important disease features.

  abstract     = {In deep neural networks, performance can degrade when test data distributions differ from training data. Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) aims to improve generalization across unseen domains by leveraging multiple source domains without supervision. Traditional methods focus on extracting domain-invariant features, potentially at the expense of feature space integrity and generalization potential. We presents a Multi-Domain Representation Network (MDRN) for unsupervised multi-domain learning. MDRN innovates by disentangling and preserving both domain-invariant and domain-specific features through an unsupervised cross-domain reconstruction task. It employs content encoders for domain-invariant features and multi-domain style encoders for domain-specific characteristics. By merging these features based on domain similarity, MDRN constructs a comprehensive feature space that enhances image reconstruction across domains. Additionally, MDRN integrates domain-specific classifiers, which learn domain classification and provide weighted fusion of domain-specific features. This design facilitates effective inter-domain distance measurement and feature integration. Experiments on PACS and DomainNet show MDRN&#39;s superior performance over existing state-of-the-art UDG approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in handling distribution shifts between source and target domains.},

It is proposed to insert the transformer into the YOLO v5 backbone network. Based on the multi-head attention mechanism in the transformer encoder, the global dependency is modelled to make full use of the context information.

The multi-model approach requires a lot of computational resources for context switching, while training one model with one dataset is not only complex, but also leads to overfitting of the multi-model approach. The authors propose a single-model multi-task approach, which can complete all tasks using only one model, and thus obtains a great improvement in inference speed, especially in scenes with high face density. After an experimental comparison, our approach saves a maximum of 96% of inference time, 49.5% of memory usage, and 59.7% of CPU time, avoids frequent context switching, and simplifies the training steps while improving the generalization performance of the model.},

Therefore, based on the third-order zigzag displacement field and a layer-spring model, a four-node quadrilateral quasi-conforming plate element (QCQ4) is proposed to calculate the free vibration of the composite laminates with interfacial imperfection. In addition, combined with the numerical results from other literature, it is verified that the proposed plate element (QCQ4) can effectively obtain the stress and deflection of the composite laminates with interfacial imperfection, and accurately calculate the free vibration of laminates with different geometries, thicknesses and fiber directions. Furthermore, numerical results show that when the dimensionless interface parameter R characterizing the interfacial imperfection increases from 0.0 to 1.0 and 5.0, respectively, the maximum reduction in the natural frequency of the laminated thick and thin plates in the first six modes exceeds 33% and 37%. This means that and seem to be two critical values for evaluating whether thick and thin laminates will experience a significant decrease in stiffness due to interfacial imperfection. Besides, it is also found that as the increase of the dimensionless interface parameter R , the 4th and 5th mode shapes of the square and circular laminate, and the 5th and 6th mode shapes of the triangular laminate will change compared with the mode shapes of laminates without interfacial imperfection.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the optimal control of constrained mechanical systems, with potential additional kinematic constraints at the final time. Correspondingly, the equations of motion of the underlying mechanical system assume the form of differential-algebraic equations with end constraints. The proposed discretisation of the optimality conditions yields a scheme which is capable of preserving control angular momentum maps resulting from the rotational symmetry of the underlying optimal control problem. The numerical solution of the discretised system is first tested with two solution strategies: Monolithic and staggered approaches, and then also solved with hybrid approaches, which combine salient features of each individual strategy. The monolithic strategy solves all the optimality conditions for all time steps as a single system of non-linear equations and relies on a Newton-Raphson scheme, which guarantees quadratic rates of convergence in the vicinity of the optimal solution trajectory. The staggered strategy is based on the Forward-Backward Sweep Method (FBSM), where state and adjoint equations are solved separately, and the control equations provide an update of the control variables, which we here achieve with also a Newton-Raphson scheme. The proposed hybrid strategies combine the advantages of a conventional gradient-based FBSM with the individual Newton-based solution procedures once the solution is close to the optimal trajectory. The strategies are developed and compared through three representative numerical examples, which show that all schemes yield very similar solutions. However, the hybrid approaches become more advantageous in the computation time when the time-step decreases or the size of the problem increases.},

However, the significant computational demands still pose challenges, particularly in dynamic simulations. To mitigate these challenges, we present a newly devised asynchronous variational integrator (AVI) for phase field modeling of dynamic fracture, implemented within the framework of the finite element library FEniCS. The AVI allows each spatial mesh element to progress independently with its own characteristic time step. In the new approach, displacement updates occur as usual at each time step, while the phase field is globally solved after the displacement update of the largest spatial mesh element rather than after each time step. Benchmark problems are investigated to assess the performance and reliability of the new method, revealing notable computational savings while effectively capturing intricate dynamic fracture behavior.},

Based on the automatically generated adaptive background mesh, a reference displacement method for spatial points is first developed to obtain reasonable reference displacements with rotational correction for spatial control points. The RBF is then used to interpolate the rotation angle of the boundary represented by the quaternion. Therefore, the large angle deformation can be more smoothly propagated to the spatial region. In the background mesh, the translational deformation is obtained by the damping function based on the minimum distance, the rotational deformation is calculated by rotating around a small number of nodes with the minimum distance from the wall surface, and the final rotational displacement is obtained by inverse distance weighting. This method ensures boundary orthogonality. Afterwards, the one-step reference displacement method is developed. A subset of mesh nodes on the boundary surface and one layer outside the boundary are automatically selected using a greedy algorithm and considered as control points. The spatial point is assigned a value using a reference displacement. The deformation displacement of the background mesh is calculated using the RBF method, and then interpolated into the computational grid. The obtained results show that this method can significantly improve the orthogonality of the boundary layer and retain the high accuracy of the RBF method for elastic deformation. In addition, a two-step spatial multi-point selection method is developed. Using a spatial peak selection method of high flexibility based on the quality change before and after mesh deformation, multiple spatial points are selected and considered as control points at a time, which allows for increased stability and robustness of the dynamic mesh method for the one-step reference displacement method. The deformation ability of the two-step spatial multi-point selection method is increased by 20% compared with that of the one-step reference displacement method in a single deformation step. The criterion for point selection is general, and the algorithm has high efficiency, which allows spatial control points to be selected in multiple regions. The two-step spatial multi-point selection method provides a smooth mesh, stretching the overlapped and squeezed mesh. The CPU cost is comparable to the RBF, and iteration is not required. The time complexity of the proposed multiple point selection method is reduced to 2/(M + 1) times that of the single-point selection method, which adds one spatial point at a time until M points are added. Several typical examples show that the proposed methods improve the mesh quality by about 30% for two-dimensional flow and 17% for three-dimensional flow while ensuring the computational efficiency.},

We obtained the difference value in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form as the output of learning using the factorization machine. The QUBO form difference was subjected to the original Hamiltonian as the correction term. The performance of this correction term was evaluated by calculating the energy for a equilibrium state of diblock copolymer. In phase-field analysis, the time evolution equation is formulated so that the total free energy decreases; hence, a lower the free energy means a more accurate result close to that of a conventional method. When we performed annealing with correction terms, the microstructure showed a Gibbs free energy that was lower than that obtained without the correction terms.},

  abstract     = {Finite periodic layout for multicomponent systems signifies a compelling design strategy for constructing complex larger structures through assembling repeating representative unit-cells with various orientations. In addition to better transportability, handleability and replaceability, design with structural segmentation has been considered particularly valuable for additive manufacturing of large workpiece due to limited printing dimension of machine. However, existing design optimization of periodic structures has been largely restricted to simple translational placements of unit-cells, sophisticated tessellation with differently oriented topological unit-cells remains underexplored. This paper presents an efficient and adaptable topology optimization framework for concurrently optimizing periodic structures comprised of repeating topological unit-cells and their tailored orientations. By introducing a weighting factor associated with different orientation states of unit-cells, a dominant orientation for each unit-cell can gradually emerge in the course of optimization process. The proposed procedure combines the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model for topology optimization of unit-cell and the discrete material optimization (DMO) technique for the optimization of its orientation. The optimization objective is to minimize structural compliance subject to volume fraction constraint. Through sensitivity analysis, optimality criteria can be applied to simultaneously optimize a representative unit-cell (RUC) topology and the orientation weighting factors in the periodic macrostructure. Several 2D and 3D examples are investigated to demonstrate significant enhancement in compliance reduction of up to 34% compared to conventional periodic design without orientation optimization. This represents a notable improvement in finite periodic structural optimization, particularly leveraging the topology optimization to tailor unit-cell orientation rather than relying on brute-force search approaches. Our methodology paves a new avenue for designing more efficient and readily manufacturable lightweight structures with enhanced performance metrics.},

However, it is challenging to identify the load-carrying boundary in density-based topology optimization frame. To address this issue, a direct load-carrying boundary identification method is proposed to describe and update the design-dependent boundary load, and a topology optimization method for structures with design-dependent boundary load is presented. First, a Flood Fill algorithm (FFA) based domain extension method is introduced to generate a new structure with a boundary equivalent to the load-carrying boundary of the original structure. Then, the erosion boundary identification method is applied to the new structure to identify the load-carrying boundary instead of the original structure. Finally, the load information (direction and magnitude) of the design-dependent boundary load is determined using a normalized gradient algorithm, which completes the update of the design-dependent boundary load. This method overcomes the difficulty of identifying the load-carrying boundary in density-based methods. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by several examples of minimum compliance (including 3D) and flexible mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {We establish a surrogate model for computational homogenization of composite materials consisting of multiple viscoelastic constituents. A surrogate macroscopic material is identified by performing interpolation using radial basis functions (RBFs) and cubic spline functions on a constitutive database generated by a series of microscopic analyses or, equivalently, numerical material tests (NMTs) on a unit cell to represent anisotropic stress relaxation behavior as well as its dependence on strain rate and temperature. After briefly reviewing the two-scale boundary value problem derived based on homogenization theory, an RBF interpolation with a normalized kernel is formulated for a discrete dataset, and an optimization algorithm is applied to determine the three hyperparameters so as to achieve proper interpolation. Then, we formulate the surrogate homogenization model (SHM) using the interpolants to substitute for the macroscopic viscoelastic response. To show the specific procedure of the proposed surrogate modeling and demonstrate the performance of the created SHM, a representative numerical example is presented in the offline and online stages. In the offline stage, NMTs are carried out in the space of training data, including the temperature, to generate a dataset as long as the macroscopic stresses can be learned exhaustively, and then optimization is performed to determine the set of hyperparameters. Then, to validate the created SHM, its responses to unseen loading and temperature histories are compared with the corresponding NMT results. In the online stage, the created SHM is used to carry out a macroscopic analysis of a simple structure under specific loading and temperature conditions, and subsequently, the obtained macroscopic stresses are compared with those obtained from the localization analysis results. The results are also compared with those obtained from the single-scale direct numerical analyses.},

We leverage a convolutional neural parameterization of a level set for a description of the geometry and use this in an unfitted finite element method that is differentiable with respect to the level set everywhere in the domain. We construct the parameter to objective map in such a way that the gradient can be computed entirely by automatic differentiation at roughly the cost of an objective function evaluation. Without handcrafted initializations, the method produces regular topologies close to the optimal solution for standard benchmark problems whilst maintaining the ability to solve a more general class of problems than standard methods, for example, interface-coupled multiphysics.},

  abstract     = {Computational investigations of Inverted Singlet-Triplet (INVEST) emitters often rely on ADC(2) and TD-DFT excitation energies (EEs) obtained with the vertical approximation. Here, we first considered several cyclazine derivatives and examine the sensitivity of vertical EEs (VEEs) as well as singlet-triplet gaps, ΔE S1T1 gaps, to the level at which the ground state (S 0 ) structure was optimized. For cyclazine, VEEs and vertical gaps from ADC(2) or TD-DFT are spread over a narrow range (&lt; 0.064 eV) whether the S 0 structure is optimized with various DFT, CCSD, and RI-MP2 methods. However, for asymmetric cyclazines, depending on the protocol for optimizing S 0 structures, not only are VEEs spread over a substantially wider range (up to 0.75 eV) but so are vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps (up to 0.30 eV), leading to cases where, with different S 0 structures, one obtains positive vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps or significantly negative gaps. We relate this behavior to the introduction of significant asymmetry and bond-length variations in the cyclazine derivatives, formed by ligand functionalization or modification of the cyclazine core. On a more positive note, adiabatic EEs (AEEs) and adiabatic ΔE S1T1 gaps display significantly lower sensitivity (7–30× less) to the geometry optimization protocols than their vertical analogs. Crucially, for cyclazine, the M06-HF functional with 100% non-local exchange provides the closest S 0 geometry to available CCSD(T) data. We show that this effect exists also for other frameworks (e.g., azulene, pentaazaphenalene, and non-alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons) that have been considered for the INVEST property, with VEEs spread over a broader range of up to 1.19 eV and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps over a range of 0.62 eV. For INVEST emitters, it is therefore extremely important to judiciously choose the computational protocol for optimizing ground state geometries, in computing VEEs and vertical ΔE S1T1 gaps.},

There are also four bis-histidine-ligated hemes involved in the electron transfers. CcNiR has been studied before, using essentially the same methods as here. However, the mechanism is very complicated, involving six reductions, and quite different results for the mechanism have been obtained here. For example, the tyrosine has here been found to be redox active in the final step when ammonia is produced. Also, the arginine has here been found to stay protonated throughout the mechanism, which is different from what was found in the previous study. The present results are in very good agreement with experimental findings and are, therefore, another case where the methodology has been shown to work very well.

However, in high-entropy nanoalloys, the diverse atomic environments present challenges in systematically exploring all possible combinations. Due to computational resource limitations, generating a sufficient number of samples is infeasible. Consequently, the d -band center should be treated as a response variable in machine-learning models. We calculated the d -band center for individual atoms and applied supervised learning techniques to identify key factors influencing its behavior. While several factors were identified, their physical significance in predicting d -band centers remained unclear. To address this issue, we incorporated various interatomic distance terms as descriptors, along with element-based coordination numbers (ECN). The resulting model closely resembled the overlap integral of the Slater-type orbital, and the regression coefficients of the ECN exhibited sensitivity to the effective principal quantum number and nuclear charge. Understanding the physical significance of these descriptors is crucial for improving property predictions and facilitating data collection on novel materials.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a hybrid machine learning (ML) approach is presented for accurately predicting activation energies ( E a ) of gas-phase elementary reactions involving organic compounds with up to seven non-hydrogen atoms. Given the importance of activation energies in reaction studies and modeling, ML composite models were created that effectively integrate molecular descriptors with semi-empirical and single energy density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The dataset, containing 300 randomly selected elementary gas-phase reactions, was assembled using accurate DFT (ωB97X-D3/def2-TZVP) values for activation energies E a from a database alongside semi-empirical computations. For accurate predictions, this approach required the inclusion of both physical organic and geometric/empirical descriptors in the training procedure. The best two ML models demonstrated efficient E a prediction capability, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.314 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.992 (Model 3) and (MAE) of 1.949 kcal mol −1 and R 2 of 0.979 (Model 2) in validation tests. Notably, this performance approaches the threshold of “chemical accuracy” of 1 kcal mol −1 . Model&#39;s 3 robustness was tested across the reaction types present in the dataset, demonstrating its ability in properly predicting activation energies, which is critical for the study and optimization of chemical processes.},

  abstract     = {This study benchmarks the nuclear electronic orbital density functional theory (NEO-DFT) method for a set of molecules that is larger than in previous studies. The focus is on proton affinity predictions to assess the influences of computational parameters. NEO-DFT incorporates nuclear quantum effects for protons involved in protonation processes. Using a test set of 72 molecules with experimental proton affinities as reference, we evaluated various exchange-correlation functionals, finding that B3LYP-based functionals deliver the most accurate results. Among the tested functionals, CAM-B3LYP performs the best with an MAD value of 6.2 kJ/mol with respect to experimental data. In NEO-DFT, electron-proton correlation (epc) functionals were assessed, with LDA-type epc17-2 yielding comparable results to the GGA-type epc19 functional. Compared to traditional DFT (MAD value of 31.6 kJ/mol), which treats nuclei classically, NEO-DFT provides enhanced accuracy for proton affinities when electron-proton correlation is included. Regarding basis sets, the def2-QZVP electronic basis set achieved the highest accuracy with an MAD value of 5.0 kJ/mol, though at a higher computational cost compared to def2-TZVP and def2-SVP, while nuclear basis sets showed minimal impact on proton affinity accuracy and no consistent trend. Overall, this study demonstrates NEO-DFT&#39;s efficacy in addressing nuclear quantum effects for proton affinity predictions, providing guidance on optimal parameter selection for future NEO-DFT applications.},

  abstract     = {With the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs), its applications in chemistry have become increasingly widespread, especially in the prediction of various molecular properties. This work introduces the X2-PEC method, that is, the second generalization of the X1 series of ANN methods developed in our group, utilizing pair energy correction (PEC). The essence of the X2 model lies in its feature vector construction, using overlap integrals and core Hamiltonian integrals to incorporate physical and chemical information into the feature vectors to describe atomic interactions. It aims to enhance the accuracy of low-rung density functional theory (DFT) calculations, such as those from the widely used BLYP/6-31G(d) or B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) methods, to the level of top-rung DFT calculations, such as those from the highly accurate doubly hybrid XYGJ-OS/GTLarge method. Trained on the QM9 dataset, X2-PEC excels in predicting the atomization energies of isomers such as C 6 H 8 and C 4 H 4 N 2 O with varying bonding structures. The performance of the X2-PEC model on standard enthalpies of formation for datasets such as G2-HCNOF, PSH36, ALKANE28, BIGMOL20, and HEDM45, as well as a HCNOF subset of BH9 for reaction barriers, is equally commendable, demonstrating its good generalization ability and predictive accuracy, as well as its potential for further development to achieve greater accuracy. These outcomes highlight the practical significance of the X2-PEC model in elevating the results from lower-rung DFT calculations to the level of higher-rung DFT calculations through deep learning.},

Not only for unraveling important features of cancer development, a disease that affects the lives of many people worldwide, but also to understand drug–target interactions in a more real scenario, which can help to combat this disease. Therefore, aiming to contribute to new strategies against cancer, the present work used this approach to investigate the spectroscopy of 2-(2′-hydroxy-4′-aminophenyl)benzothiazole (HABT) when interacting with the PI3K enzyme, a widely associated target for the mentioned illness. The study consisted of evaluating the Excited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) performance of HABT, in spectroscopic terms, when interacting with the PI3K enzyme in a local nonequilibrium regime. This scenario could be considered by investigating the metastable states of HABT in this system. From this, it was possible to observe that the ESIPT performance of HABT considerably differs when comparing the solution and protein environments, where 63% have appropriate geometry in the protein environment, against 97% in the aqueous environment. Thus, from an entirely theoretical methodology, the present work provides insights when modeling biological systems and contributes significantly to a better comprehension of promising probes for cancer diagnosis.},

For an extremely large steric repulsion in the covalent form, the ion pair can become the most stable form, even in the gas phase. DFT and CASSCF calculations indicate that the tert-butylfulleride anion and the tris[1-(5-isopropyl-3,8-dimethylazulenyl)]-cyclopropenylium cation form an ion pair. This is the first study of this ion pair, although it is the building block of a salt that has already been synthesized. DFT results indicate that this ion pair is considerably more stable than its covalent counterpart. Nevertheless, several properties of the ionic and covalent forms are similar. An energy decomposition analysis indicates the polarization, electrostatic, and dispersion terms as the most important attractive terms between the ions.},

The resulting formulation enables a solution with “a priori” localized orbitals. In the current contribution, we have explored this still unexplored possibility. Starting molecular orbitals were either localized using the Pipek-Mezey procedure or via an incomplete Cholesky decomposition of the density matrix. The Hartree-Fock solution was obtained within a VCCS iterative procedure, with the starting localized molecular orbitals used for the creation of the reference and the singly excited determinants. The same localized basis was kept in each iteration. For a series of medium-sized molecules, we have investigated the convergence behavior of the iterative procedure together with the sparsity of the single-excitation amplitude vector and the corresponding density matrix expressed in the localized basis.},

However, their physical meaning remains largely unexplored and poorly understood. It is the purpose of this work to shed new light on this issue. The main thesis developed here is that de-excitations are not a peculiarity of TDDFT but that they are a more fundamental property of the underlying wave functions reflecting how electrons are excited between partially occupied orbitals. The paraquinodimethane (pQDM) molecule is chosen as a convenient model system whose open-shell character can be modulated via twisting of its methylene groups. Using the one-electron transition density matrix as a rigorous basis for our analysis, we highlight qualitative and quantitative parallels in the way that de-excitations are reflected in multireference wave function and TDDFT computations. As a physically observable consequence, we highlight a lowering of the transition dipole moment that derives from destructive interference between the excitation and de-excitation contributions. In summary, we hope that this work will shed new light on formal and practical aspects regarding the application of TDDFT to excited-state computations, especially of diradicaloid systems.},

In 1990, a paper was published in which the physical causes for the rotational barrier in ethane, that is, the well-known finding that the potential energy in the eclipsed form is slightly higher than in the staggered form, appears as a consequence of a lowering of the nuclear-electron attraction and not as a greater electronic repulsion in the eclipsed form. Surprisingly, this finding has practically not found its way neither into the textbook literature nor into the scientific discourse. Here we will show, by a careful analysis of the components to the total energy and their dependence on the geometry of the molecule, that the kinetic energy of the electrons and the virial theorem play the decisive role. This is very similar to their role for the origin of the chemical bond.},

We have taken into account a cluster with two layers of Pd and and atoms per layer (2L3 and 2L4, respectively) or with three layers and atoms per layer (3L3).

For 3L3, an indirect charge-transfer mechanism, occurring after 50 fs and inducing a hole injection into HCOO, has also been found. Moreover, we also used a tailored pulse to populate the antibonding molecular orbital localized on the C-H bond for 3L3.},

In response, this study aims to address these two challenges by examining the effects of real-time demands and restaurant density on delivery reliability, as well as how the type of driver (i.e., in-house versus crowdsourced drivers) moderates these effects. We evaluated our model with a unique dataset obtained from one of the top three on-demand meal delivery platforms in China, and our research sheds light on several key findings. Specifically, our study finds inverted U-shaped relationships between real-time demands and delivery reliability and a positive relationship between restaurant density and delivery reliability. In addition, it reveals that crowdsourced drivers perform better than in-house drivers under high real-time demands. This study contributes to the literature by clarifying how delivery reliability can be influenced by real-time demands and restaurant density.

While prior research on order dispatch algorithms has largely focused on minimizing delivery time or delay, the direct impact of delivery performance on repeat purchases remains underexplored. Using transactional data from an online meal delivery platform in China, we empirically investigate the asymmetric effects of early and late deliveries on customer repurchasing behavior. To address potential endogeneity, we introduce driver experience and local knowledge, two previously overlooked factors in platform algorithms, as novel instrumental variables. The survival analysis shows that late deliveries significantly reduce future orders, while early deliveries provide only limited benefits. Guided by these empirical insights, we develop a simulation-based evaluation of different order dispatch algorithms, revealing that maximizing future orders, rather than minimizing delivery time or delays, yields the highest future orders. These insights offer actionable recommendations for platform managers, stressing the importance of strategic adjustments in dispatch algorithms and integrating heterogeneous treatment effects into algorithmic design. By merging operational delivery performance with consumer behavior insights through causal inference and optimization, this study provides a novel end-to-end framework for creating data-driven dispatch algorithms that enhance both service efficiency and customer retention.},

  abstract     = {In the highly competitive e-commerce industry, customer-facing warehouses are crucial as the “order penetration points” for e-commerce last-mile operations. This research examines how warehouses use last-minute coordination, an unstructured mechanism, to ensure sufficient inventory at the order penetration points. Previous research has focused on structured mechanisms like contracts and inventory management systems to enhance warehouse performance. However, these mechanisms can be ineffective when faced with unforeseen local contingencies. To adjust inventory and adapt to changes in supply and/or demand, warehouses need to engage in unstructured, last-minute coordination with other warehouses. Using coordination and loose coupling theories, we find that coordinating with many warehouses (i.e., large coordination scope) reduces the operational efficiency of individual warehouses. At the network level, we find that a centralized coordination structure improves the operational efficiency of the entire network. We also show that demand uncertainty reinforces the existing last-minute coordination patterns, using the Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (ST-ERGM). This research highlights the importance of last-minute coordination and reveals its effects on both individual warehouses and the overall network.},

The new model includes the standard stochastic volatility model as a special case and has the same limit as the fractional integrated stochastic volatility (FISV) model, which is the continuous-time fractional Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. A simulated maximum likelihood method, which maximizes the time-domain log-likelihood function calculated by the importance sampling technique, and a frequency-domain quasi maximum likelihood method (or quasi Whittle) are employed to estimate the model parameters. Simulation studies suggest that, while both estimation methods can accurately estimate the model, the simulated maximum likelihood method outperforms the quasi Whittle method. As an illustration, we fit the FSV and FISV models with the proposed estimation techniques to the S&amp;P 500 composite index over a sample period spanning 45 years.},

  abstract     = {Risk parity portfolio optimization, using expected shortfall as the risk measure, is investigated when asset returns are fat-tailed and heteroscedastic with regime switching dynamic correlations. The conditional return distribution is modeled by an elliptical multi-variate generalized hyperbolic distribution, allowing for fast parameter estimation via an expectation-maximization algorithm, and a semi-closed form of the risk contributions. A new method for efficient computation of non-Gaussian risk parity weights sidesteps the need for numerical simulations or Cornish–Fisher-type approximations. Accounting for fat-tailed returns, the risk parity allocation is less sensitive to volatility shocks, thereby generating lower portfolio turnover, in particular during market turmoils such as the global financial crisis or the COVID shock. While risk parity portfolios are rather robust to the misuse of the Gaussian distribution, a sophisticated time series model can improve risk-adjusted returns, strongly reduces drawdowns during periods of market stress and enables to use a holistic risk model for portfolio and risk management.},

This article introduces new techniques for estimating, identifying and simulating MARMA models. Although the estimation of the parameters is done using second-order moments, the identification relies on the existence of high-order dynamics, captured in the high-order spectral densities and the correlation of the squared residuals. A comprehensive Monte Carlo study demonstrated the robust performance of our estimation and identification methods. We propose an empirical application to 24 portfolios from emerging markets based on the factors: size, book-to-market, profitability, investment and momentum. All portfolios exhibited forward-looking behavior, showing significant non-causal and non-invertible dynamics. Moreover, we found the residuals to be uncorrelated and independent, with no trace of conditional volatility.},

We also consider the role of several popular restrictions on the dynamics of the factors. Using a novel dataset of end-of-month continuously compounded Treasury yields on US zero-coupon bonds and frequentist estimation based on the extended Kalman filter, we show that a second decay parameter does not contribute to better forecasts. In concordance with the preferred habitat theory, we also show that the best forecasting model depends on the maturity. For short maturities, the best performance is obtained in a heteroscedastic model with a time-varying decay parameter. However, for long maturities, neither the time-varying decay nor the heteroscedasticity plays any role, and the best forecasts are obtained in the basic DNS model with the shape of the yield curve depending on macroeconomic activity. Finally, we find that assuming non-stationary factors is helpful in forecasting at long horizons.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel class of stochastic volatility models, which can utilize and relate many high-frequency realized volatility (RV) measures to latent volatility. Instrumental variable methods provide a unified framework for estimation and testing. We study parameter inference problems in the proposed framework with nonstationary stochastic volatility and exogenous predictors in the latent volatility process. Identification-robust methods are developed for a joint hypothesis involving the volatility persistence parameter and the autocorrelation parameter of the composite error (or the noise ratio). For inference about the volatility persistence parameter, projection techniques are applied. The proposed tests include Anderson-Rubin-type tests and their point-optimal versions. For distributional theory, we provide finite-sample tests and confidence sets for Gaussian errors, establish exact Monte Carlo test procedures for non-Gaussian errors (possibly heavy-tailed), and show asymptotic validity under weaker assumptions. Simulation results show that the proposed tests outperform the asymptotic test regarding size and exhibit excellent power in empirically realistic settings. The proposed inference methods are applied to IBM&#39;s price and option data (2009–2013). We consider 175 different instruments (IVs) spanning 22 classes and analyze their ability to describe the low-frequency volatility. IVs are compared based on the average length of the proposed identification-robust confidence intervals. The superior instrument set mostly comprises 5-min HF realized measures, and these IVs produce confidence sets which show that the volatility process is nearly unit-root. In addition, we find RVs with higher frequency yield wider confidence intervals than RVs with slightly lower frequency, indicating that these confidence intervals adjust to absorb market microstructure noise. Furthermore, when we consider irrelevant or weak IVs (jumps and signed jumps), the proposed tests produce unbounded confidence intervals. We also find that both RV and BV measures produce almost identical confidence intervals across all 14 subclasses, confirming that our methodology is robust in the presence of jumps. Finally, although jumps contain little information regarding the low-frequency volatility, we find evidence that there may be a nonlinear relationship between jumps and low-frequency volatility.},

  abstract     = {Equivalences of initial value problems (IVPs) of both nonlinear higher order (Riemann–Liouville type) fractional differential equations (FDEs) and Caputo FDEs with the corresponding integral equations are studied in this paper. It is proved that the nonlinearities in the FDEs can be L 1 $$ {L}&amp;#x0005E;1 $$ -Carathéodory with suitable conditions. The new results generalize the previous results which assumed that the nonlinearities are continuous. For the Caputo FDEs, it is shown in this paper that the continuity assumptions on the nonlinearities used in the literature before are not sufficient for the obtained equivalences. A counterexample is provided to exhibit this. The previous equivalence results with the continuity assumptions alone in the literature have been widely used to study the existence of solutions and numerical solutions of the Caputo FDEs up to now, so according to the new results obtained in this paper, there are no guarantees that the solutions of the integral equations obtained in the literature are the solutions of the Caputo FDEs. New conditions which are stronger than continuity are provided to ensure the equivalences. Sufficient conditions for solutions of the integral equations to be solutions of the Caputo FDEs are obtained. The new equivalence results and the sufficient conditions will be useful for further studying the existence of solutions and numerical solutions of the nonlinear Caputo FDEs via the corresponding integral equations.},

This reinforces the understanding of symmetry analysis and explores the application of differential geometry and physics to the analysis of selected problems.

Unlike conventional methods that incorporate a single inertial step, our approach employs dual inertia to accelerate convergence while preserving stability. The proposed method combines the viscosity approximation technique with the extragradient method to guarantee strong convergence. Initially, the extragradient method is applied under a Lipschitz continuity assumption on the equilibrium bifunction. Subsequently, this condition is relaxed by adopting a self-adaptive step size strategy, allowing variable step sizes to be updated iteratively based on the current iterates information. Notably, the algorithm operates without requiring prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constants or any line search procedures. Strong convergence is established under mild condition, and its applicability to variational inequality problems is demonstrated. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing its capability to handle large-scale and complex problems efficiently while outperforming traditional single-inertia methods.},

The study presents a new Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantine-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIQRS) computer virus propagation model with two delays. In addition, we introduce impulse control, an optimal control method, to explore the effect of the impulse period on the model. We first derive the basic reproduction number of the model. Then, the characteristic equations and eigenvalues are discussed analytically by controlling the delay parameters variation in order to analyze local stability and Hopf bifurcation for the computer virus model. Next, we add impulse control and find that it could better control the propagation of computer viruses. Firstly, we analyze the dynamical behavior of this model using the relevant theories of time delay differential equations to provide a theoretical basis for the effective elimination and control of virus propagation in computer networks. Secondly, we use Matlab to conduct numerical simulations, which verify the correctness of theoretical results. Finally, we synthesize the theoretical and experimental analysis of the present model to provide some scientific suggestions for better control of the spreading of computer viruses.},

Traditional models often fail to capture such dynamics, making TFBSE particularly important for accurately reflecting market behaviors over time. In this paper, we propose a novel compact difference scheme to solve the mixed-type TFBSE. Discretization in the time direction is accomplished using the L1 scheme. To achieve fourth-order discretization in the spatial direction, a compact difference method based on the reduced-order method is employed. The stability and convergence of the proposed scheme under the norm are established using the discrete energy method. Finally, a series of numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical results, demonstrating both the accuracy and efficiency of the method in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an enhanced analysis of a stochastic epidemic model that integrates vaccination and discontinuities. Our methodology initiates with formulating a perturbed model incorporating dual general incidence functions and a thorough distribution for jump components. After confirming the well-posed nature of this model, we proceed to establish a global threshold criterion that discerns between the persistence and eradication of the infection. The accuracy of this threshold is scrutinized through numerical simulations utilizing real data related to COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. A distinctive feature of our approach is its departure from previous studies, as we provide a comprehensive framework and pinpoint optimal conditions for the model.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of this paper is to classify the first transitions of a general class of one spatial dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations on a bounded interval. The linear part of the equation is assumed to have a real discrete spectrum with a complete set of eigenfunctions, which are of the form sin ⁡ k ⁢ x $$ \sin kx $$ or cos ⁡ k ⁢ x , k ∈ ℕ $$ \cos kx,\kern0.3em k\in \mathbb{N} $$ . The nonlinear operator consists of arbitrary finite products and sums of the unknown function and its derivatives of arbitrary order. The equations allow for a trivial steady-state solution that becomes unstable when a control parameter exceeds a certain threshold. Unlike most of the previous research in this direction that considers specific equations, this general framework is suitable for extension in several directions such as the higher spatial dimensions and different basis vectors. Under a set of assumptions that are often valid in many interesting applications, we derive two numbers called the transition number and the critical index which completely describe the first dynamic transition. We make detailed numerical computations that reveal the properties of the transition numbers. To show the applicability of our theoretical results, we determine the first transitions of several well-known equations including the Cahn–Hilliard, thin film, Harry Dym, Kawamoto, and Rosenau–Hyman equations.},

To address existence, uniqueness, stability, and numerical results, fractional derivatives are substituted by diffusion equations relative to a new independent variable, resulting in an augmented model with a dissipative semigroup operator. Polynomial decay of energy is achieved, with a decay rate depending on the fractional derivative parameters. Both the polynomial decay and its dependency on the parameters of the generalized Caputo derivative are numerically validated.

Numerical simulations correlated quite strongly with observed data, while projections for the 2024–2030 period indicate that controlled population growth bodes well for the outlook of the economy for India, supporting economic prosperity alongside reduced inflation and better employment conditions. The findings presented in this work are correlational; therefore, to find the possible cause for this phenomenon, further research is required with detailed datasets.

  abstract     = {A Filippov system of crop-pest-natural enemy with a Holling-II type functional response function is developed based on the fear effect and threshold control strategy. The threshold control strategy is mainly a means of controlling pests and natural enemies. When the number of natural enemies is below a threshold, the natural enemies cannot achieve a controlling effect on the pest population and control is needed to suppress the outbreak. In this case, the fear of pests to natural enemies will affect the pest&#39;s survival mode, thus affecting the pest&#39;s dynamic behavior. However, the number of natural enemy population exceeds the threshold density, and there is no need to control the system. At this point, the pest&#39;s fear of natural enemies is almost zero. The dynamic behavior of the two subsystems of the model is discussed, the existence and stability of various equilibria are analyzed, and the existence of sliding and crossing regions is also investigated. In addition, it is possible that the established model has more than one pseudo-equilibrium. Therefore, the dynamic behavior of the pseudo-equilibria is analyzed, and we observe that Hopf bifurcation occurs near the pseudo-equilibria. By numerically simulating the global sliding bifurcation of the system, we discover that as the bifurcation parameters are varied, the system exhibits a series of bifurcations such as grazing bifurcation, buckling bifurcation, crossing bifurcation, and period-halving bifurcation.},

  abstract     = {In this article, our main objective is to propose a high-order local meshless method for numerical solution of two-dimensional distributed-order time-fractional cable equation on both regular and irregular domains. First, the distribution-order integral is approximated by the Gauss-Legendre quadrature formula, and then a second-order weighted and shifted Grünwald difference (WSGD) scheme is applied to approximate the time Riemann-Liouville derivatives. The stability and convergence analysis of the time-discrete outline are investigated by the energy approach. The spatial dimension of the model is discretized by the fourth-order local radial basis function-Hermite finite difference (RBF-HFD) method. Some numerical experiments are performed on regular and irregular computational domains to verify the ability, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed numerical procedure. The numerical simulations clearly demonstrate the high accuracy of the provided numerical process in comparison to existing procedures. Finally, it can be concluded that the presented technique is a suitable alternative to the existing numerical techniques for the distributed-order time-fractional cable equation.},

The problem involves studying the null controllability cost of a transport–diffusion equation with Neumann conditions, where the diffusivity coefficient is denoted by ε &gt; 0 $$ \varepsilon &amp;gt;0 $$ and the velocity by B ⁡ ( x , t ) $$ \mathfrak{B}\left(x,t\right) $$ . Our objective is twofold. First, we investigate the scenario where each velocity trajectory B $$ \mathfrak{B} $$ originating from Ω ‾ $$ \overline{\Omega} $$ enters the control region in a shorter time at a fixed entry time. By employing Agmon and dissipation inequalities, and Carleman estimate in the case is the gradient of a time-dependent scalar field, we establish that the control cost remains bounded for sufficiently small and large control time. Secondly, we explore the case where at least one trajectory fails to enter the control region and remains in . In this scenario, we prove that the control cost explodes exponentially when the diffusivity approaches zero and the control time is sufficiently small for general velocity.},

In this paper, we applied the PDE approach to price European continuous-installment option and consider Heston stochastic volatility model for the dynamics of the underlying asset. We proved the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for our pricing problem based on the two-dimensional finite element method. Due to the flexibility to continue or stop paying installments, installment options pricing can be modeled as an optimal stopping time problem. This problem is formulated as an equivalent free boundary problem and then as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). We wrote the resulted LCP in the form of a variational inequality and used the finite element method for the discretization. Then the resulting time-dependent LCPs are solved by using a projected successive over relaxation iteration method. Finally, we implemented our numerical method. The numerical results verified the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical method.},

Due to the degeneracy, we first transfer to study an approximate nondegenerate system. Next, we establish the Carleman estimate for backward stochastic degenerate parabolic equation with convection term. In order to deal with the convection term, the Carleman estimate is established by introducing an auxiliary function to transfer the diffusion and the convection term into a whole complex divergence-like form. By this Carleman estimate, we then obtain an observability inequality for the adjoint system of the approximate system.

Soliton solutions are essential for analyzing nonlinear wave behaviors in different physical systems, and the Kaup–Newell model is also significant in this context. The model&#39;s ability to represent subpicosecond pulses makes it a significant tool for the research of nonlinear optics and plasma physics. Overall, the Kaup–Newell model is an important research domain in these areas, with ongoing efforts focused on understanding its various solutions and potential applications. A new version of the generalized exponential rational function method and -expansion function method are utilized to discover diverse soliton solutions. The generalized exponential rational function method facilitates the generation of multiple solution types, including singular, shock, singular periodic, exponential, combo trigonometric, and hyperbolic solutions in mixed forms. Thanks to -expansion function method, we obtain trigonometric, hyperbolic, and rational solutions. The modulation instability of the proposed model is examined, with numerical simulations complementing the analytical results to provide a better understanding of the solutions&#39; dynamic behavior. These results offer a foundation for future research, making the solutions effective, manageable, and reliable for tackling complex nonlinear problems. The methodologies used in this study are robust, influential, and practicable for diverse nonlinear partial differential equations; to our knowledge, for this equation, these methods of investigation have not been explored before.

We use fixed representations of the domain and mesh, assume blood to be an incompressible Newtonian fluid, and simulate the chamber volume variation by introducing a capacitance function, which is space and time-dependent. The inclusion of this capacitance function gives rise to a model whose differential form resembles the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The numerical methodology is based on stable Galerkin mixed finite element formulations posed on velocity and pressure. Convergence studies for the two-dimensional steady-state Stokes equation with spatially-varying capacitance indicate optimal convergence orders when combining continuous biquadratic velocities with continuous bilinear pressures (Taylor–Hood elements) or discontinuous unmapped linear pressures. On the other hand, we observed loss of optimality with discontinuous linear mapped approximations for this field, as expected for the classical Stokes problem. Additional convergence studies indicate that the optimal convergence properties are preserved in the resolution of the nonlinear model, for the case of smooth solutions. Finally, we present simulations of cardiac cycles in an idealized human left ventricle in two and three dimensions. The results are meaningful given the model simplicity and open the possibility for future extensions of the proposed methodology.},

To demonstrate the results, the concept of bounded integral contractors is combined with the stochastic result and sequencing technique. In contrast to previous publications, we do not need to specify the induced inverse of the controllability operator to prove the stability results, and the relevant nonlinear function does not have to meet the Lipschitz condition. Furthermore, exponential stability results for neutral stochastic differential systems with Poisson jump have been established. Finally, an application to demonstrate the acquired results is discussed.

Firstly, based on the differential-algebraic inequality technique, the global stability criteria of the considered system are obtained to ensure the complex-valued DDANN achieves global exponential stability. Next, by designing an appropriate feedback controller, to get the desired results, we present some constraint conditions, which make the drive system and the response system achieve the global exponential synchronization. Furthermore, as an application, a complex-valued neutral-type neural network (NDNN) can be transformed into a simple complex-valued DDANN and the global exponential stability results of NDNN are also proposed. In the end of paper, two examples are given to verify the superiority/feasibility of the presented theoretical results.},

It is shown that the stability of steady-state solutions and their evolution are mainly determined by the eigenvalue spectrum of a linearized system and the fractional derivative order. It is also demonstrated that the basic properties of auto-wave solutions in fractional-order systems can essentially differ from those in standard systems. The results of the linear stability analysis are confirmed by computer simulations of the generalized fractional van der Pol–FitzHugh–Nagumo mathematical model.

  abstract = {Detecting statistical differences among functional dataset or streaming signal dataset is of interest to many diverse fields, including neurophysiology, imaging, biomedical engineering, and public health. For example in our study, our interest is to provide the guideline for detecting the lowest drug dosage level for glioblastoma as quickly as possible in which the intensity functional curves are different among dosage groups. However, such functional data often have unknown and nonlinear massive correlated curves that lead to difficulties in detecting their significant differences without explicit likelihood functions. Existing detecting procedures mainly test a linear, quadratic, or specific parametric form of departure and require explicit likelihood functions due to estimating specific models. In this paper, we propose a flexible detecting method to test any unknown functional departure in a generalized functional regression without estimating models. We develop our detecting method under a generalized semiparametric functional model framework in which the explicit likelihood function does not exist. We develop our detecting method using the approximated Bayes factor, a score-type test, and the estimating equations. The decision of rejecting (or not) the null hypothesis is made using the Frequentist p -values. We also studied the asymptotic properties of our method. We compare our detecting method to the alternative method regarding the type-I error and power under various simulation settings. We demonstrate the advantages of our method by applying two real datasets: functional data of drug-exposed glioblastoma cell line and diffusion tensor imaging tractography.},

The semi-parametric nature of the model eliminates the need for specific distributional assumptions about the angular error, enhancing its versatility. Extensive simulation studies, incorporating von Mises and wrapped Cauchy distributions, highlight the robustness of the framework. The model&#39;s practical utility is demonstrated through real-world data analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum, showcasing its ability to derive meaningful insights from complex data structures.},

  abstract = {The marginal regression model is convenient for analyzing correlated responses, including repeated measures and longitudinal data. This paper proposes a robust marginal linear model for analyzing a vector of univariate responses with correlated components by incorporating an innovative multivariate Huber distribution. It employs a flexible parameterization using modified Cholesky decomposition, provides a convenient approach for estimating the covariance matrix, and allows for subject-varying the tuning parameter. Our research introduces a method for estimating parameters by employing the exact likelihood function through the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. To highlight the advantage of our model, we carried out a simulation experiment and reanalyzed two real-world case studies in the health and economics fields. The results indicate that our model offers a more robust analysis by assigning appropriate weights to extreme observations, thereby handling outliers more effectively than traditional models.},

NA 0 CT 2 $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_0{\mathrm{CT}}^2 $$ is implemented through an iterative procedure and involves two straightforward steps in each iteration—generating noisy data based on the core tensor from the Tucker decomposition of the updated parameter estimate and running a regular GLM on noise-augmented data on vectorized predictors. We demonstrate the implementation of NA 0 CT 2 $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_0{\mathrm{CT}}^2 $$ and its ℓ 0 $$ {\mathrm{\ell}}_0 $$ regularization effect in both simulation studies and real data applications.

  abstract = {Neural networks have been employed to identify materials of interest from hyperspectral data (generally imagery) based on their unique spectral signatures. This approach assumes that there is a single material that is standing out from the rest of the spectrum to be identified. However, pixels often contain more than one material, or a material of interest may itself be a mixture of multiple materials. Neural networks are only as good as the data used to train them, and it takes a great deal of work in the laboratory to identify, make, and measure all potential mixtures of interest. Thus, researchers often calculate synthetic spectra using algorithms with varying degrees of fidelity to the physics that govern the interactions between light and multiple materials. In this work, we have (1) adapted a neural network designed to identify mixture components from Raman spectroscopy to work with visible to near-infrared reflectance data and (2) tested three common mixture algorithms to determine the most accurate and least computationally expensive method to build synthetic training datasets. With our initial test dataset, we have achieved accuracies of &gt; 90% and found that the synthetic training dataset produced using the Hapke mixture model provides the best results.},

We introduce the conditional mean calibrated Greenwood statistic and its variants, including the coefficient of variation, to adapt to this complex situation. The asymptotic results we present showcase their effectiveness even when such distortions are present. Moreover, for general distributions of the unobserved variable, we extend the methodology by proposing calibrated-modified Greenwood statistics and the coefficient of variation. These methods are demonstrated to be asymptotically efficient under various assumptions about the distortion function. Furthermore, we conduct Monte Carlo simulation experiments to assess the performance of the proposed estimators and test statistics, during which we compare our proposed test statistics with existing ones. For illustrative purposes, these methods are then applied to analyze a real-world dataset. MSC2020 Classification: 62G05, 62G08, 62G20},

Identifying the differences in microbial taxa across two different health conditions is clinically important, as it can enhance our understanding of disease pathology from a microbiome perspective and potentially lead to preventive or therapeutic strategies. However, there are three main challenges for analyzing microbiome data, due to compositionality, sparsity, and high dimensionality of the relative abundances. Although a few two-sample tests have been proposed for analyzing microbiome data, the statistical power cannot be guaranteed as the true alternative hypothesis is unknown. To potentially address this issue, we propose an adaptive microbiome-based truncated test (AMTT) that produces high power for various alternative hypotheses. Simulation studies with a wide range of scenarios are conducted, the results indicate that AMTT is not only powerful in almost all the scenarios but also effectively controls type I error rates. Real data about Parkinson&#39;s intestinal microbiome is analyzed to demonstrate its practical performance.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number and complexity of advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks have significantly increased, posing major challenges for organizations in effectively detecting and mitigating these threats. Although various APT detection methods have been developed, current approaches still face limitations, such as poor generalization leading to high false alarm rates. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel ensemble learning model called MCG, based on the combination of three main components: multilayer perceptron (MLP), correlated recursion (CR) layer, and graph attention network (GAT). The MLP component extracts flow features from network traffic, the CR layer constructs the IP information network by grouping and linking network behaviors, and finally, the GAT layer analyzes relationships between IPs through an attention mechanism. The MCG model proposed in this article has demonstrated superior performance in APT detection by effectively leveraging the strengths of each component, enabling more accurate identification of abnormal behaviors and reducing false alarms. The experimental results, presented in Section 4.4, show that the MCG model significantly improves accuracy and outperforms traditional methods. This demonstrates that the proposed model not only makes significant theoretical contributions but also offers practical value, providing a more reliable and effective solution for early detection and warning of APT attacks.},

The objective of this study is to explore treatment-covariate interaction tests involving covariate-adaptive randomization. Without assuming a parametric data-generating model, we investigate usual interaction tests and observe that they tend to be conservative: specifically, their limiting rejection probabilities under the null hypothesis are typically strictly lower than the nominal level. To address this problem, we propose modifications to the usual tests to obtain corresponding valid tests with limiting rejection probabilities equal to the nominal level. Moreover, we introduce a novel class of stratified-adjusted interaction tests that are simple, more powerful than the usual and modified tests, and broadly applicable to most covariate-adaptive randomization methods. The results encompass two types of interaction tests: one involving stratification covariates and the other involving additional covariates that are not used for randomization. Our study clarifies the application of interaction tests in clinical trials and offers valuable tools for revealing treatment heterogeneity, crucial for advancing personalized medicine.},

This article proposes a novel sequence outlier detection method based on the gated recurrent unit autoencoder with Gaussian mixture model (GRU-AE-GMM), which combines gated recurrent unit (GRU), autoencoder (AE), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and optimization algorithms. The GRU captures long-term dependencies within the sequence, while the AE measures sequence abnormality. Meanwhile, the GMM models the relationship between the original and reconstructed sequences, employing the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation to calculate the likelihood of each hidden variable belonging to each Gaussian mixture component. In this article, we first train the model with mean-squared error loss (MSEL), and then further enhanced by substituting it with quantile loss (QL), composite quantile loss (CQL), and Huber loss (HL), respectively. Next, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model through Monte Carlo experiments conducted under different error terms. Finally, the method is applied to Amazon stock data for 2022, demonstrating its significant potential for application in dynamic and unpredictable market environments.},

These include the high-dimensionality of the data, the high codimension in the ambient space of the data manifolds of interest, and that the structure of machine learning models may encourage classifiers to develop decision boundaries close to data points. This article proposes a new framework for studying adversarial examples that does not depend directly on the distance to the decision boundary. Similarly to the smoothed classifier literature, we define a (natural or adversarial) data point to be ( γ , σ)-stable if the probability of the same classification is at least γ $$ \gamma $$ for points sampled in a Gaussian neighborhood of the point with a given standard deviation σ $$ \sigma $$ . We focus on studying the differences between persistence metrics along interpolants of natural and adversarial points. We show that adversarial examples have significantly lower persistence than natural examples for large neural networks in the context of the MNIST and ImageNet datasets. We connect this lack of persistence with decision boundary geometry by measuring angles of interpolants with respect to decision boundaries. Finally, we connect this approach with robustness by developing a manifold alignment gradient metric and demonstrating the increase in robustness that can be achieved when training with the addition of this metric.},

  abstract     = {When screening for low-prevalence diseases, pooling specimens (e.g., blood, urine, swabs, etc.) through group testing has the potential to substantially reduce costs when compared to testing specimens individually. A common goal in group testing applications is to estimate the relationship between an individual&#39;s true disease status and their individual-level covariate information. However, estimating such a relationship is a non-trivial problem because true individual disease statuses are unknown due to the group testing protocol and the possibility of imperfect testing. While several regression methods have been developed in recent years to accommodate the complexity of group testing data, the functional form of covariate effects is typically assumed to be known. To avoid model misspecification and to provide a more flexible approach, we propose a Bayesian additive regression trees framework to model the individual-level probability of disease with potentially misclassified group testing data. Our methods can be used to analyze data arising from any group testing protocol with the goal of estimating unknown functions of covariates and assay classification accuracy probabilities.},

  abstract     = {When planning a clinical trial for a time-to-event endpoint, we require an estimated effect size and need to consider the type of effect. Usually, an effect of proportional hazards is assumed with the hazard ratio as the corresponding effect measure. Thus, the standard procedure for survival data is generally based on a single-stage log-rank test. Knowing that the assumption of proportional hazards is often violated and sufficient knowledge to derive reasonable effect sizes is usually unavailable, such an approach is relatively rigid. We introduce a more flexible procedure by combining two methods designed to be more robust in case we have little to no prior knowledge. First, we employ a more flexible adaptive multi-stage design instead of a single-stage design. Second, we apply combination-type tests in the first stage of our suggested procedure to benefit from their robustness under uncertainty about the deviation pattern. We can then use the data collected during this period to choose a more specific single-weighted log-rank test for the subsequent stages. In this step, we employ Royston-Parmar spline models to extrapolate the survival curves to make a reasonable decision. Based on a real-world data example, we show that our approach can save a trial that would otherwise end with an inconclusive result.

  abstract     = {Kidney cancer, a potentially life-threatening malignancy affecting the kidneys, demands early detection and proactive intervention to enhance prognosis and survival. Advancements in medical and health sciences and the emergence of novel treatments are expected to lead to a favorable response in a subset of patients. This, in turn, is anticipated to enhance overall survival and disease-free survival rates. Cure fraction models have become essential for estimating the proportion of individuals considered cured and free from adverse events. This article presents a novel piecewise power-law cure fraction model with a piecewise decreasing hazard function, deviating from the traditional piecewise constant hazard assumption. By analyzing real medical data, we evaluate various factors to explain the survival of individuals. Consistently, positive outcomes are observed, affirming the significant potential of our approach. Furthermore, we use a local influence analysis to detect potentially influential individuals and perform a postdeletion analysis to analyze their impact on our inferences.},

  abstract     = {The importance of covariate adjustment in clinical trials has been underscored by the U.S. FDA&#39;s guidance. Inference, with or without covariates, after implementing covariate adaptive randomization (CAR), is garnering increased interest. This paper investigates the sequential monitoring of covariate-adaptive randomized clinical trials through non-parametric methods, a critical advancement for enhancing the precision and efficiency of medical research. CAR, which incorporates baseline patient characteristics into the randomization process, aims to mitigate the risk of confounding and improve the balance of covariates across treatment groups, thereby addressing patients&#39; heterogeneity. Although CAR is known for its benefits in reducing biases and enhancing statistical power, its integration into sequentially monitored clinical trials—a standard practice—poses methodological challenges, particularly in controlling the type I error rate. By employing a non-parametric approach, we demonstrate through theoretical proofs and numerical analyses that our methods effectively control the type I error rate and surpass traditional randomization and analysis methods. This paper not only fills a gap in the literature on sequential monitoring of CAR without model misspecification but also proposes practical solutions for enhancing trial design and analysis, thereby contributing significantly to the field of clinical research.},

Informativeness of the number of units on certain levels often manifests itself in multilevel data analysis and failure to account for this phenomenon will lead to biased inference. Moreover, utilizing an incorrect marginalization approach will also lead to invalid conclusions. To identify the appropriate marginal distribution to be tested in multilevel designs, we propose a sequential testing procedure to test for informativeness of unit sizes in multilevel structures with three levels. At a given level of the design, a bootstrap method is developed to estimate the null distribution of no informativeness of unit size. Simulation studies confirm the efficacy of our sequential procedure in maintaining an overall Type I error rate. Additionally, we extend our testing procedure to a multilevel regression setting, enhancing its practical applicability. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed methods through the analysis of data from a study on periodontal disease and a study on stress levels of preschoolers.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the Swedish Betula study, we consider the joint modeling of longitudinal memory assessments and the hazard of dementia. In the Betula data, the time-to-dementia onset or its absence is available for all participants, while some memory measurements are missing. In longitudinal studies of aging, one cannot rule out the possibility of dropout due to health issues resulting in missing not at random longitudinal measurements. We, therefore, propose a pattern-mixture sensitivity analysis for missing not-at-random data in the joint modeling framework. The sensitivity analysis is implemented via multiple imputation as follows: (i) multiply impute missing not at random longitudinal measurements under a set of plausible pattern-mixture imputation models that allow for acceleration of memory decline after dropout, (ii) fit the joint model to each imputed longitudinal memory and time-to-dementia dataset, and (iii) combine the results of step (ii). Our work illustrates that sensitivity analyses via multiple imputations are an accessible, pragmatic method to evaluate the consequences of missing not at-random data on inference and prediction. This flexible approach can accommodate a range of models for the longitudinal and event-time processes. In particular, the pattern-mixture modeling approach provides an accessible way to frame plausible missing not at random assumptions for different missing data patterns. Applying our approach to the Betula study shows that worse memory levels and steeper memory decline were associated with a higher risk of dementia for all considered scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Disease models are used to examine the likely impact of therapies, interventions, and public policy changes. Ensuring that these are well calibrated on the basis of available data and that the uncertainty in their projections is properly quantified is an important part of the process. The question of non-identifiability poses a challenge to disease model calibration where multiple parameter sets generate identical model outputs. For statisticians evaluating the impact of policy interventions such as screening or vaccination, this is a critical issue. This study explores the use of the Bayesian framework to provide a natural way to calibrate models and address non-identifiability in a probabilistic fashion in the context of disease modeling. We present Bayesian approaches for incorporating expert knowledge and external data to ensure that appropriately informative priors are specified on the joint parameter space. These approaches are applied to two common disease models: a basic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and a much more complex agent-based model which has previously been used to address public policy questions in HPV and cervical cancer. The conditions that allow the problem of non-identifiability to be resolved are demonstrated for the SIS model. For the larger HPV model, an overview of the findings is presented, but of key importance is a discussion on how the non-identifiability impacts the calibration process. Through case studies, we demonstrate how informative priors can help resolve non-identifiability and improve model inference. We also discuss how sensitivity analysis can be used to assess the impact of prior specifications on model results. Overall, this work provides an important tutorial for researchers interested in applying Bayesian methods to calibrate models and handle non-identifiability in disease models.},

  abstract     = {Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) is an increasingly popular framework for the estimation of causal effects. It requires modeling both the exposure and outcome but is doubly robust in the sense that it is valid if at least one of these models is correctly specified. In addition, TMLE allows for flexible modeling of both the exposure and outcome with machine learning methods. This provides better control for measured confounders since the model specification automatically adapts to the data, instead of needing to be specified by the analyst a priori . Despite these methodological advantages, TMLE remains less popular than alternatives in part because of its less accessible theory and implementation. While some tutorials have been proposed, none address the case of a time-to-event outcome. This tutorial provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of the implementation of TMLE for estimating the effect of a point binary or multilevel exposure on a time-to-event outcome, modeled as counterfactual survival curves and causal hazard ratios. The tutorial also provides guidelines on how best to use TMLE in practice, including aspects related to study design, choice of covariates, controlling biases and use of machine learning. R-code is provided to illustrate each step using simulated data ( https://github.com/detal9/SurvTMLE ). To facilitate implementation, a general R function implementing TMLE with options to use machine learning is also provided. The method is illustrated in a real-data analysis concerning the effectiveness of statins for the prevention of a first cardiovascular disease among older adults in Québec, Canada, between 2013 and 2018.},

  abstract     = {In various missing data problems, values are not entirely missing, but are coarsened. For coarsened observations, instead of observing the true value, a subset of values - strictly smaller than the full sample space of the variable - is observed to which the true value belongs. In our motivating example for patients with endometrial carcinoma, the degree of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) can be either absent, focally present, or substantially present. For a subset of individuals, however, LVSI is reported as being present, which includes both non-absent options. In the analysis of such a dataset, difficulties arise when coarsened observations are to be used in an imputation procedure. To our knowledge, no clear-cut method has been described in the literature on how to handle an observed subset of values, and treating them as entirely missing could lead to biased estimates. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluated the best strategy to deal with coarsened and missing data in multiple imputation. We tested a number of plausible ad hoc approaches, possibly already in use by statisticians. Additionally, we propose a principled approach to this problem, consisting of an adaptation of the SMC-FCS algorithm (SMC-FCS : Coarsening compatible), that ensures that imputed values adhere to the coarsening information. These methods were compared in a simulation study. This comparison shows that methods that prevent imputations of incompatible values, like the SMC-FCS method, perform consistently better in terms of a lower bias and RMSE, and achieve better coverage than methods that ignore coarsening or handle it in a more naïve way. The analysis of the motivating example shows that the way the coarsening information is handled can matter substantially, leading to different conclusions across methods. Overall, our proposed SMC-FCS method outperforms other methods in handling coarsened data, requires limited additional computation cost and is easily extendable to other scenarios.},

Existing strategies rely on either blinded or unblinded methods to inform such adjustments and, ideally, perform these adjustments in a way that preserves Type I error at the nominal level. Here, we propose an approach that uses partially-unblinded methods for SSR for both binary and continuous endpoints. Although this approach has operational unblinding, its partial use of the unblinded information for SSR does not include the interim effect size, hence the term ‘partially-unblinded.’ Through proof-of-concept and simulation studies, we demonstrate that these adjustments can be made without compromising the Type I error rate. We also investigate different mathematical expressions for SSR under different variance scenarios: homogeneity, heterogeneity, and a combination of both. Of particular interest is the third form of dual variance, for which we provide additional clarifications for binary outcomes and derive an analogous form for continuous outcomes. We show that the corresponding mathematical expressions for the dual variance method are a compromise between those for variance homogeneity and heterogeneity, resulting in sample size estimates that are bounded between those produced by the other expressions, and extend their applicability to adaptive trial design.},

When considering realistic numbers of agents and properly accounting for stochasticity, this high-dimensional calibration can be computationally prohibitive. This paper presents a random forest-based surrogate modeling technique to accelerate the evaluation of ABMs and demonstrates its use to calibrate an epidemiological ABM named CityCOVID via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The technique is first outlined in the context of CityCOVID&#39;s quantities of interest, namely hospitalizations and deaths, by exploring dimensionality reduction via temporal decomposition with principal component analysis (PCA) and via sensitivity analysis. The calibration problem is then presented, and samples are generated to best match COVID-19 hospitalization and death numbers in Chicago from March to June in 2020. These results are compared with previous approximate Bayesian calibration (IMABC) results, and their predictive performance is analyzed, showing improved performance with a reduction in computation.},

  abstract     = {The prognostic significance of biomarker variability in predicting associated disease risk is well-established. However, prevailing methods that assess the relationship between biomarker variability and time to event often overlook within-subject correlation in longitudinal measurement errors, resulting in biased parameter estimates and erroneous statistical inference. Additionally, these methods typically assume that biomarker trajectory can be represented as a linear combination of spline basis functions with normally distributed random effects. This not only leads to significant computational demands due to the necessity of high-dimensional integration over the random effects but also limits the applicability because of the normality restriction imposed on the random effects. This paper addresses these limitations by incorporating correlated longitudinal measurement errors and proposing a novel semiparametric multiplicative random effects model. This model does not assume normality for the random effects and eliminates the need for integration with respect to them. The biomarker variability is incorporated as a covariate within a Cox model for time-to-event data, thus facilitating a joint modeling strategy. We demonstrate the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and validate their performance through simulation studies. The methodology is applied to assess the impact of systolic blood pressure variability on cardiovascular mortality using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.},

  abstract     = {In the quest for enhanced HIV prevention methods, the advent of antiretroviral drugs as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has marked a significant stride forward. However, the ethical challenges in conducting placebo-controlled trials for new PrEP agents against a backdrop of highly effective existing PrEP options necessitate innovative approaches. This manuscript delves into the design and implementation of active-controlled trials that incorporate a counterfactual placebo estimate—a theoretical estimate of what HIV incidence would have been without effective prevention. We introduce a novel statistical framework for regulatory approval of new PrEP agents, predicated on the assumption of an available and consistent counterfactual placebo estimate. Our approach aims to assess the absolute efficacy (i.e., against placebo) of the new PrEP agent relative to the absolute efficacy of the active control. We propose a two-step procedure for hypothesis testing and further develop an approach that addresses potential biases inherent in non-randomized comparisons to counterfactual placebos. By exploring different scenarios with moderately and highly effective active controls and counterfactual placebo estimates from various sources, we demonstrate how our design can significantly reduce sample sizes compared to traditional non-inferiority trials and offer a robust framework for evaluating new PrEP agents. This work contributes to the methodological repertoire for HIV prevention trials and underscores the importance of adaptability in the face of ethical and practical challenges.},

  abstract     = {Platform trials are multi-arm designs that simultaneously evaluate multiple treatments for a single disease within the same overall trial structure. Unlike traditional randomized controlled trials, they allow treatment arms to enter and exit the trial at distinct times while maintaining a control arm throughout. This control arm comprises both concurrent controls, where participants are randomized concurrently to either the treatment or control arm, and non-concurrent controls, who enter the trial when the treatment arm under study is unavailable. While flexible, platform trials introduce the challenge of using non-concurrent controls, raising questions about estimating treatment effects. Specifically, which estimands should be targeted? Under what assumptions can these estimands be identified and estimated? Are there any efficiency gains? In this article, we discuss issues related to the identification and estimation assumptions of common choices of estimand. We conclude that the most robust strategy to increase efficiency without imposing unwarranted assumptions is to target the concurrent average treatment effect (cATE), the ATE among only concurrent units, using a covariate-adjusted doubly robust estimator. Our studies suggest that, for the purpose of obtaining efficiency gains, collecting important prognostic variables is more important than relying on non-concurrent controls. We also discuss the perils of targeting ATE due to an untestable extrapolation assumption that will often be invalid. We provide simulations illustrating our points and an application to the ACTT platform trial, resulting in a 20% improvement in precision compared to the naive estimator that ignores non-concurrent controls and prognostic variables.},

In the first step, a case–control study is performed as an efficient but potentially biased design. In a second step, a population-based cohort study is performed as an unbiased but less efficient design. In order to accelerate diagnostic research, it has recently been suggested to combine the two designs in one seamless design. In this article, we present a more in-depth description of this idea. The seamless diagnostic accuracy study design is formally introduced by comparison with the traditional pathway, and the basic design decisions are discussed: A stopping rule and a stopping time. An appealing feature of the design is the possibility to ignore the seamless design in the final analysis, although part of the data is used already in an interim analysis. The justification for this strategy is provided by a large-scale simulation study. The simulation study suggests also that the risk of a loss of power due to using a seamless design can be limited by a reasonable choice of the futility boundaries, defining the stopping rule. We conclude that the seamless diagnostic accuracy study design seems to be ready to use. It promises to accelerate diagnostic research, in particular if population-based cohort studies can be started without great efforts and if the reference standard can be evaluated with little delay.},

The first stage involves selecting promising treatment group(s), followed by comparing the efficacy between the selected and control groups in the second stage. This study focused on a two-stage adaptive seamless design where treatment selection is based on a short-term binary endpoint, while the comparison is based on a long-term binary endpoint. Recently, exact and mid- p $$ p $$ tests were proposed in this setting. However, treatment effects at the second stage were estimated using the conventional maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), leading to upward bias owing to treatment selection. We propose the conditional mean-adjusted estimator (CMAE) and uniformly minimum variance conditional unbiased estimator (UMVCUE) to address the bias in this setting. Additionally, confidence intervals for exact and mid- tests were constructed using the Clopper-Pearson method. Simulation studies were performed to compare the six inference methods defined by combinations of the three estimators and two statistical tests. The simulation results showed that MLE of the treatment effect at the second stage exhibited a notable bias, while CMAE and UMVCUE substantially reduced the bias. The exact test was conservative in terms of the type-I error rate of the comparison at the second stage, while the mid- test yielded results close to the nominal level. In conclusion, we recommend statistical inferences based on the CMAE + mid- test or UMVCUE + mid- test in our setting.},

  abstract     = {Based on data from a randomized, controlled vaccine efficacy trial, this article develops statistical methods for assessing vaccine efficacy (VE) to prevent COVID-19 infections by a discrete set of genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2. Strain-specific VE adjusting for possibly time-varying covariates is estimated using augmented inverse probability weighting to address missing viral genotypes under a competing risks model that allows separate baseline hazards for different risk groups. Hypothesis tests are developed to assess whether the vaccine provides at least a specified level of VE against some viral genotypes and whether VE varies across genotypes. Asymptotic properties providing analytic inferences are derived and finite-sample properties of the estimators and hypothesis tests are studied through simulations. This research is motivated by the fact that previous analyses of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy did not account for missing genotypes, which can cause severe bias and efficiency loss. The theoretical properties and simulations demonstrate superior performance of the new methods. Application to the Moderna COVE trial identifies several SARS-CoV-2 genotype features with differential vaccine efficacy across genotypes, including lineage (Reference, Epsilon, Gamma, Zeta), indicators of residue match vs. mismatch to the vaccine-strain residue at Spike amino acid positions (identifying signatures of differential VE), and a weighted Hamming distance to the vaccine strain. The results show VE decreases against genotypes more distant from the vaccine strain, highlighting the need to update COVID-19 vaccine strains.},

We propose a flexible, additive mixed model for studying volume-outcome associations in health care that takes into account individual patient characteristics as well as provider-specific effects through a hierarchical approach. More specifically, we treat volume as a continuous variable, and its effect on the considered outcome is modeled as a smooth function. We take account of different case-mixes by including patient-specific risk factors and clustering on the provider level through random intercepts. This strategy enables us to extract a smooth volume effect as well as volume-independent provider effects. These two quantities can be compared directly in terms of their magnitude, which gives insight into the sources of variability of quality of care. Based on a causal DAG, we derive conditions under which the volume-effect can be interpreted as a causal effect. The paper provides confidence sets for each of the estimated quantities relying on joint estimation of all effects and parameters. Our approach is illustrated through simulation studies and an application to German health care data about mortality of very low birth weight infants.},

In research areas such as multi-center clinical trials, recurrent events, and genetic studies, proportional hazard mixed effects models (PHMMs) are used to account for correlations observed in clusters within the data. In high dimensions, proper specification of the fixed and random effects within PHMMs is difficult and computationally complex. In this paper, we approximate the proportional hazards mixed effects model with a piecewise constant hazard mixed effects survival model. We estimate the model parameters using a modified Monte Carlo expectation conditional minimization (MCECM) algorithm, allowing us to perform variable selection on both the fixed and random effects simultaneously. We also incorporate a factor model decomposition of the random effects in order to more easily scale the variable selection method to larger dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of our method using simulations, and we apply our method to a multi-study pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma gene expression dataset to select features important for survival.},

  abstract     = {A common problem in numerous research areas, particularly in clinical trials, is to test whether the effect of an explanatory variable on an outcome variable is equivalent across different groups. In practice, these tests are frequently used to compare the effect between patient groups, for example, based on gender, age, or treatments. Equivalence is usually assessed by testing whether the difference between the groups does not exceed a pre-specified equivalence threshold. Classical approaches are based on testing the equivalence of single quantities, for example, the mean, the area under the curve or other values of interest. However, when differences depending on a particular covariate are observed, these approaches can turn out to be not very accurate. Instead, whole regression curves over the entire covariate range, describing for instance the time window or a dose range, are considered and tests are based on a suitable distance measure of two such curves, as, for example, the maximum absolute distance between them. In this regard, a key assumption is that the true underlying regression models are known, which is rarely the case in practice. However, misspecification can lead to severe problems as inflated type I errors or, on the other hand, conservative test procedures. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by introducing a flexible extension of such an equivalence test using model averaging in order to overcome this assumption and making the test applicable under model uncertainty. Precisely, we introduce model averaging based on smooth Bayesian information criterion weights and we propose a testing procedure which makes use of the duality between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by means of a simulation study and illustrate its practical relevance considering a time-response case study with toxicological gene expression data.},

The theoretical results are illustrated in a simulation study. The crude SR can be interpreted as an estimator of the hazard ratio (HR) of treatment when the allowed time between initiation of the treatment and the outcome drug is small. The HR can easily be estimated flexibly as a function of covariates, such as age and sex, using logistic regression. The crude SR implicitly adjusts for unmeasured time-invariant confounding, whereas the null-effects SR, and thereby the adjusted SR, make little sense unless treatment and outcome are strictly independent. The use of the adjusted SR should be abandoned. Another design should be used if it is infeasible to require treatment and outcome sufficiently close. The crude SR can be modeled flexibly with logistic regression to estimate covariate-dependent HRs or at least to test whether the HR depends on covariates.},

One major challenge is to determine the number of threshold effects. We first show the selection consistency of a modified Bayesian information criterion under mild conditions. It is useful sometimes but heavily depends on the penalization magnitude, which usually varies from the model configuration and data distribution. To address this issue, we leverage a cross-validation criterion alongside an order-preserved sample-splitting scheme to yield a consistent estimation. The new criterion is completely data driven without additional parameters and thus robust to model setting and data distributions. The asymptotic properties for the parameter estimates are also carefully established. Additionally, we propose an efficient score-type test to examine the existence of threshold effects. The new statistic is free of estimating any potential threshold effects and is thus suitable for multithreshold scenarios. Numerical experiments validate the reliable finite-sample performance of our methodologies, which corroborates the theoretical results.},

Each ANCOVA estimator is model-assisted, as its point estimator is consistent even when the working model is misspecified. Under the stepped wedge randomization scheme, we establish the finite population Central Limit Theorem for each estimator.

  abstract     = {Several models for count time series have been developed during the last decades, often inspired by traditional autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models for real-valued time series, including integer-valued ARMA (INARMA) and integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (INGARCH) models. Both INARMA and INGARCH models exhibit an ARMA-like autocorrelation function (ACF). To achieve negative ACF values within the class of INGARCH models, log and softplus link functions are suggested in the literature, where the softplus approach leads to conditional linearity in good approximation. However, the softplus approach is limited to the INGARCH family for unbounded counts, that is, it can neither be used for bounded counts, nor for count processes from the INARMA family. In this paper, we present an alternative solution, named the Tobit approach, for achieving approximate linearity together with negative ACF values, which is more generally applicable than the softplus approach. A Skellam–Tobit INGARCH model for unbounded counts is studied in detail, including stationarity, approximate computation of moments, maximum likelihood and censored least absolute deviations estimation for unknown parameters and corresponding simulations. Extensions of the Tobit approach to other situations are also discussed, including underlying discrete distributions, INAR models, and bounded counts. Three real-data examples are considered to illustrate the usefulness of the new approach.},

  abstract     = {The Erdös–Rényi graph is a popular choice to model network data as it is parsimoniously parameterized, straightforward to interpret and easy to estimate. However, it has limited suitability in practice, since it often fails to capture crucial characteristics of real-world networks. To check its adequacy, we propose a novel class of goodness-of-fit tests for homogeneous Erdös–Rényi models against heterogeneous alternatives that permit nonconstant edge probabilities. We allow for both asymptotically dense and sparse networks. The tests are based on graph functionals that cover a broad class of network statistics for which we derive limiting distributions in a unified manner. The resulting class of asymptotic tests includes several existing tests as special cases. Further, we propose a parametric bootstrap and prove its consistency, which avoids the often tedious variance estimation for asymptotic tests and enables performance improvements for small network sizes. Moreover, under certain fixed and local alternatives, we provide a power analysis for some popular choices of subgraph counts as goodness-of-fit test statistics. We evaluate the proposed class of tests and illustrate our theoretical findings by simulations.},

We develop a classical hypothesis test for completed epidemics which assesses whether or not there is significant within-group transmission during an outbreak. The test is based on time-ordered group labels of individuals. The null hypothesis is that of homogeneity of disease transmission among individuals, a hypothesis under which the discrete random vector of groups labels has a known sampling distribution that is independent of any model parameters. The test exhibits excellent performance when applied to various scenarios of simulated data and is also illustrated using two real-life epidemic data sets. We develop some asymptotic theory including a central limit theorem. The test is practically very appealing, being computationally cheap and straightforward to implement, as well as being applicable to a wide range of real-life outbreak settings and to related problems in other fields.},

Recently, the first inference methods for the MCV were proposed for general factorial designs. However, the inference methods are primarily derived for one special MCV variant while there are several reasonable proposals. Moreover, when rejecting a global null hypothesis, a more in-depth analysis is of interest to find the significant contrasts of MCV. This paper concerns extending the nonparametric permutation procedure to the other MCV variants and a max-type test for post hoc analysis. To improve the small sample performance of the latter, we suggest a novel bootstrap strategy and prove its asymptotic validity. The actual performance of all proposed tests is compared in an extensive simulation study and illustrated by real data analysis. All methods are implemented in the R package GFDmcv, available on CRAN.},

For computational efficiency, alternative forms of the new test statistics are also provided. We derive the universal asymptotic null distributions of the proposed test statistics under elliptical distributions and beyond. The powers of the proposed tests are further investigated.

The assumption of proportional win and loss probabilities will often in practice not be satisfied. In this paper, we present estimates for the win ratio, and win and loss probabilities, under independent right-censoring and derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimates. The proposed win ratio estimate does not require the assumption of proportional win and loss probabilities.

Confidence intervals resulting from these asymptotic approximations and the covariance bootstrap show good finite-sample coverage. In a simulation, the power of asymptotic as well as permutation tests for independence based on our correlation measures compares favorably with competing methods based on distance correlation or rank coefficients for functional dependence, among others. Moreover, for the bivariate normal distribution, our correlation coefficients equal the absolute value of the Pearson correlation, an attractive feature for practitioners which is not shared by various competitors.

  abstract     = {The integration of wavelet transformation and artificial intelligence techniques has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare applications. Wavelet analysis enables multi-scale signal decomposition and feature extraction that, when combined with machine and deep learning approaches, enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical data analysis. This systematic review synthesizes 112 relevant studies from 2013 to 2023 exploring wavelet-based artificial intelligence in healthcare. Our analysis reveals that the discrete wavelet transform dominates (43% of studies), primarily used for feature extraction from biosignals (82%) and medical images. Major applications include cardiac abnormality detection (29%), neurological disorder diagnosis (27%), and mental health assessment (16%), with classification accuracies frequently exceeding 95%. Key findings indicate a shift from traditional machine learning to deep learning approaches after 2020, with emerging trends in hybrid architectures. The review identifies critical challenges in computational efficiency, optimal wavelet selection, and clinical validation. Future developments should focus on real-time processing optimization, interpretable deep learning models, multi-modal data fusion, and validation on larger clinical datasets, advancing the translation of these systems into practical clinical tools.},
