  abstract     = {The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem aims to find the subsequence exhibiting an increasing trend in a numeric sequence with the maximum length. In this paper, we generalize the LIS problem to the longest wave subsequence (LWS) problem, which encompasses two versions: LWSt and LWSr. Given a numeric sequence A of distinct values and a target trend sequence T , the LWSt problem aims to identify the longest subsequence of A that preserves the trend of the prefix of T . And, the LWSr problem aims to find the longest subsequence of A within r segments, alternating increasing and decreasing subsequences. We propose two efficient algorithms for solving the two versions of the LWS problem. For the LWSt problem, the time complexity of our algorithm is O ( n log n ) , where n represents the length of the given numeric sequence A . Additionally, we propose an O ( r n log n ) -time algorithm for solving the LWSr problem. In both algorithms, we utilize the priority queues for the insertion, deletion, and successor operations.},

  abstract     = {Soft set theory is a mathematical approach to address the challenges of handling vague or uncertain information. It is a more advanced version of classical set theory that deals with imprecise elements and enables the flexible representation of uncertain data. It involves categorizing the elements of the universe based on specific parameters. Semigraph is a generalization of a graph which is different from a hypergraph. A hypergraph extends the concept of a graph by allowing any subset of vertices to form an edge. Semigraphs, on the other hand, distinguish themselves from hypergraphs by imposing a specific order on the vertices within each edge. Soft semigraphs were developed using the principles of soft set theory applied to semigraphs. This study introduces Eulerian and Hamiltonian soft semigraphs. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a soft semigraph to be Eulerian, relying on parameters such as p -part consecutive adjacent degree, p -part end degree, and the p -part consecutive adjacency graph. Additionally, we provide the conditions for a soft semigraph to be Hamiltonian. We introduce the concept of maximal non-Hamiltonian p -part. Finally, we define the closure of a soft semigraph and demonstrate the relationship between a Hamiltonian soft semigraph and its closure.},

  abstract     = {The concept of vulnerability in a communication network plays an important role when there is a disruption in the network. There exist several graph parameters that measure the vulnerability of a communication network. Domination integrity is one of the vulnerability parameters that measure the performance of a communication network. In this paper, we introduce the concept of paired domination integrity of a graph as a new measure of graph vulnerability. Let G = ( V , E ) be a simple, connected graph. A set of vertices in a graph G , say S , is a paired dominating set if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) every vertex of G has a neighbor in S and (ii) the subgraph induced by S contains a perfect matching. The paired domination integrity of G , denoted by P D I ( G ) , is defined as P D I ( G ) = m i n { | S | + m ( G ‚àí S ) : S is¬†a¬†paired¬†dominating¬†set¬†of¬†G } , where m ( G ‚àí S ) is the order of the largest component in the induced subgraph of G ‚àí S . In this paper, we determine few bounds relating paired domination integrity with other graph parameters and the paired domination integrity of some classes of graphs.},

  abstract     = {The error-correcting pair is a general algebraic decoding method for linear codes. Since every linear code is contained in an MDS linear code with the same minimum distance over some finite field extensions, we focus on MDS linear codes. Recently, He and Liao showed that for an MDS linear code ùíû with minimum distance 2 ‚Ñì + 2 , if it has an ‚Ñì -error-correcting pair, then the parameters of the pair have three possibilities. Moreover, for the first case, they gave a necessary condition for an MDS linear code ùíû with minimum distance 2 ‚Ñì + 2 to have an ‚Ñì -error-correcting pair, and for the other two cases, they only gave some counterexamples. For the second case, in this paper, we give a necessary condition for an MDS linear code ùíû with minimum distance 2 ‚Ñì + 2 to have an ‚Ñì -error-correcting pair, and then basing on the Product Singleton Bound, we prove that there are two cases for such pairs, and then give some counterexamples basing on twisted generalized Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes for these cases.},
