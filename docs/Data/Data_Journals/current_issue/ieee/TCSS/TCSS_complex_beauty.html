  abstract     = {Customers’ price comparison behavior and search cost evaluation play a pivotal role in shaping purchasing utility and enterprise pricing strategies. This study employs the multinomial logit (MNL) model to integrate the reference price and search cost into product line design. We probe into pure bundle and mixed bundle pricing decisions for the product line and value-added services in monopolistic settings and delve into the impacts of the reference price and search cost on pricing, profit, product variety, and strategy. Based on model analysis and numerical simulations, the results show that the reference price effect benefits low-priced offerings but undermines high-priced products, overall market share, and profit. As the reference price effect or search cost increases, product variety diminishes. In scenarios where the reference price effect and the proportion of bundled purchases are minimal, the pure bundling strategy is preferable; otherwise, the mixed bundling strategy is more advantageous. When enterprises overlook the reference price effect, there is an imbalance in the pricing of various products and services within the product line, which results in the actual market share and profit consistently falling below the ideal expectations.},

  abstract     = {The graph-based multiview clustering has gained significant attention due to its effectiveness in representing complex relationships among multiview data for enhanced clustering. Among the previous graph-based methods, the multiview graph learning (or graph fusion) technique has rapidly emerged as a promising direction, which, however, still suffers from two critical limitations. First, most of previous methods adopt a single-level of graph fusion, which lack the ability to go from single-level graph fusion to multilevel (deep) graph fusion. Second, they generally focus on constructing an optimal unified graph but cannot fully investigate the correlations among multiple views. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a comprehensive and obvious graph structure. In light of this, this article presents a new multiview graph learning method called deep similarity graph fusion (DSGF) for the multiview clustering task, where three pathways are simultaneously leveraged to fuse multilevel similarity into a unified graph. Particularly, multilevel graph fusion is utilized to obtain a view-specific similarity graph for each view and then fuse these single-view graphs (via three levels of graph fusion) into a robust graph, which takes advantage of deeper consensus information between various similarity graphs and improves the quality of the learned graph for the final spectral clustering process. Extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world multiview datasets, which demonstrate the highly competitive clustering performance of DSGF in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning, as an important branch of machine learning, has been widely applied in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more. However, recent studies have revealed that deep learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attackers inject a hidden backdoor into the deep learning model, such that the predictions of the infected model will be maliciously changed if the hidden backdoor is activated by input with a backdoor trigger while behaving normally on any benign sample. This kind of attack can potentially result in severe consequences in the real world. Therefore, research on defending against backdoor attacks has emerged rapidly. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive survey of backdoor attacks, detections, and defenses previously demonstrated on deep learning. We have investigated widely used model architectures, benchmark datasets, and metrics in backdoor research and have classified attacks, detections and defenses based on different criteria. Furthermore, we have analyzed some limitations in existing methods and, based on this, pointed out several promising future research directions. Through this survey, beginners can gain a preliminary understanding of backdoor attacks and defenses. Furthermore, we anticipate that this work will provide new perspectives and inspire extra research into the backdoor attack and defense methods in deep learning.},

  abstract     = {As topics evolve during the dissemination process, their derivative characteristics play an important role in revealing the mechanism of topic dissemination in social networks. Due to users’ cognitive inertia, followers of antecedent topics tend to pay more attention to derivative topics than ordinary users, and this cognitive inertia is directly related to the correlation between these two topics. Based on this finding, we propose a derivation topic dissemination model based on iterative multitopic derivation and social psychology, taking into full consideration users’ emotional accumulation of antecedent topics and repeated derivation of topics. First, a multiple linear regression model is used to construct a metric algorithm for user antecedent sentiment and to effectively analyze the dynamics of antecedent sentiment accumulation affecting the spread of derivative topics. Second, to analyze the interactions between and within multitopic layers in full, an iterative multitopic dissemination model iterative-susceptible infectious recovery (SIR) is proposed. In addition, the association degree is introduced to define the cross-model state transition equation by considering the association and differences among multitopics. Last, considering the influence of cognitive inertia and “continuous attention psychology” in social psychology, we construct a user psychology-based driving force model which can further improve the cross-model state transition equation. According to the experiments, the model can effectively reveal the influence of different factors on the dissemination trend of derivative topics in social networks, as well as depict the dissemination dynamics of derivative topics.},

The traditional propagation model, based mainly on rumor and antirumor messages, provides a static analysis of the rumor propagation situation. This article introduces the concept of a prom-rumor (promoting rumor) message and thoroughly investigates competition and cooperation among multitype rumor messages. First, we employ a multiple linear regression method to construct the information influence mechanism by extracting network structure, topic content information, and historical behavior information, considering the complexity of spreading multitype compound rumor messages. Then, we introduce game theory and formulate a game strategy to capture the competition and cooperation among rumors, antirumors, and prom-rumors. Furthermore, we consider the interactivity in multitype compound rumor messages and combine the dynamic game to construct the driving mechanism of rumors, antirumors, and prom-rumors. Finally, we define the user-state transfer equation and propose a dynamic model of information propagation based on rumors, antirumors, prom-rumors, and the dynamic game while considering the multidimensionality and polymorphism of multitype compound rumor messages and combining mean-field theory and the infectious disease model. In validation experiments on real-life data, the model accurately captures the game propagation process of the multitype rumors and predicts the propagation trends in rumor networks.},

The agents learn using fuzzy actor critic learning algorithms in either a hierarchical structure or a single actor critic policy. The genetic algorithm selects the discount factors, the reward weights, and the standard deviation of noise applied to actor during learning. The genetic algorithm uses a fitness function based on the ratio of successful tests the group of agents can pass after training.

In this article, we introduce a general diffusion model for ordinal opinions expressed as linear orderings over a finite set of candidates. We employ agent-based modeling to simulate a nonprogressive diffusion process, allowing multiple types of opinion diffusion about different candidates. The proposed agent-based diffusion model can forecast long-term trends of opinion diffusion in social networks by capturing voters’ personalized features and incorporating dynamic social contexts. Furthermore, we examine the possibility of affecting election outcomes by externally changing the ordinal opinions of certain vertices, i.e., campaigning. Since finding influential voters from the social network is computationally challenging, we propose a heuristic approach, i.e., backward influence rank (BIR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BIR approach is superior to the classic greedy approach for campaigning by achieving a similar margin of victory to that of the greedy approach but running two orders of magnitude faster than the greedy approach did.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the consequences of phishing scams on Ethereum have adversely affected the stability of the cryptocurrency environment. Numerous incidents have been reported that have resulted in a substantial loss of cryptocurrency. The existing literature in this area primarily leverages traditional feature engineering or network representation learning to recover crucial information from transaction records to identify suspected users. However, these methods mainly rely on handcrafted feature engineering or conventional node representation learning from a static network while ignoring the network dynamism and inherent temporal sparsity in the user behavior that results in underperformance after an extended period. This article proposes a novel sparsity-aware tensor decomposition-based architecture: SpaTeD, which retrieves efficient user representation utilizing the evolving transaction and structural information and subsequently mitigates the temporal sparsity problem. Our model is evaluated on a real-world Ethereum phishing scam dataset and reports a significant performance improvement over the baselines (96% recall and 96% F1-score). We have conducted an extensive set of experiments to verify the temporal robustness of the model. Additionally, we have provided the ablation study to demonstrate the contribution of each component of the framework.},

However, the overwhelming volume of conversations during such periods can escalate to unprecedented levels, necessitating the automated identification and matching of requests and offers to streamline relief operations. Additionally, there is a notable absence of studies conducted in multilingual settings despite the fact that any geographical area can have a diverse linguistic population. Therefore, we propose crisis response matcher (CReMa), a systematic approach that integrates textual, temporal, and spatial features to address the challenges of effectively identifying and matching requests and offers on social media platforms during emergencies. Our approach utilizes a crisis-specific pretrained model and a multilingual embedding space. We emulate human decision-making to compute temporal and spatial features and nonlinearly weigh the textual features. The results from our experiments are promising, outperforming strong baselines. Additionally, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset, simulating help-seeking and offering assistance on social media in 16 languages, and conduct comprehensive cross-lingual experiments. Furthermore, we analyze a million-scale geotagged global dataset to understand patterns in seeking help and offering assistance on social media.

However, the existing research predominantly focuses on platform-user interactions, often neglecting the potential for user collaboration, which is crucial for improving data quality and task efficiency. In practical applications, mobile users tend to cooperate with familiar individuals based on their preferences in sensing tasks. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel MCS model that integrates user cooperation, significantly enhancing the system&#39;s overall effectiveness. Specifically, users’ capabilities and costs are synthesized and managed through a cooperation degree matrix. Additionally, cooperation is updated based on historical behaviors and user preferences. To incentivize user participation, currencies are employed for recruitment. Within this framework, we investigate the maximum collaborative user selection (MCUS) problem, which is dedicated to the problem of maximizing the amount of recruitment under user cooperation. The MCUS problem is proved to be an NP-hard problem and thus intractable. To address this, we propose the minimum weighted cost replacement (MWCR) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the MWCR algorithm exhibits low complexity and high efficiency across various scales, making it an excellent solution for collaborative crowd recruitment.},

Traditional assessments are challenged by the sheer volume of data and the nuanced language found on social media and other text-based platforms. This study seeks to apply machine learning (ML) to interpret these digital narratives and identify patterns that signal mental health conditions. We apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments and emotional cues across datasets from social media and other text-based communication. Using ML, deep learning, and transfer learning models such as bidirectional encoder representations (BERTs), robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa), distilled BERT (DistilBERT), and generalized autoregressive pretraining for language understanding (XLNet), we assess their ability to detect early signs of mental health concerns. The results show that BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet consistently achieve over 95% accuracy, highlighting their strong contextual understanding and effectiveness in this application. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize mental health diagnostics by providing a scalable, data-driven approach to early detection. By harnessing the power of advanced NLP models, this study offers a pathway to more timely and accurate identification of individuals in need of mental health support, thereby contributing to better outcomes in public health.},

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) theory is a promising paradigm for problem-solving in complex systems. Multigroup role assignment (MGRA) specifically tackles the task of assigning roles for multigroup collaboration. However, due to the constraint that an agent can only play a role in one group, the current MGRA models are incapable of handling when required agents outnumber the available supply. Group multirole assignment (GMRA) resolves the problem by permitting an agent to be assigned multiple roles, but it cannot address the assignment involving multiple environments-classes, agents, roles, groups, objects (E-CARGO) groups. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive overview of the GMRA problem in multiple E-CARGO groups under various conditions, generalized as the multigroup multirole assignment (MGMRA) problem. The MGMRA problem primarily revolves around two key factors: the maximum number of roles that an agent can undertake within an E-CARGO group, and the maximum number of different roles across all E-CARGO groups, which have a significant impact on the sufficiency or necessity conditions of the algorithm as well as its performance. Therefore, a unified model and its special cases are proposed to solve the concrete assignment problems under different conditions. The effectiveness of models is verified through comprehensive experiments.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 has been spreading globally from 2019 to 2022, prompting many countries to establish consistent, timely, and strict intervention policies during this period. However, the existing analysis of central epidemiological parameters (CPPs) falls short in exploring the consistency of transmission laws implied by these policies. To resolve this limitation, we propose a consistent transmission law inference framework. This framework first provides a coarse-to-fine detection method to extract outbreaks and devises an autonomous inference sliding window (ASW) algorithm to estimate the infected-case-dependent CPPs of these outbreaks. Then, we reveal consistent transmission laws through a differential analysis of the estimated CPPs. Focusing on the transmission of COVID-19 in China, a typical country with a consistent intervention policy, our model reveals remarkably consistent outbreak laws. In short, the policy controls the effective growth rate almost to zero (to a 1E-03 scale) within three days since the outbreak started. Specifically: 1) the policy was very effective at the beginning of the outbreak, leading to the exposure rate hitting the bottom on one day between the second and eleventh days and then keeping it at a plateau; 2) under large-scale nucleic acid testing and contact tracking, the incubation rate decreased and reached a plateau mainly on the third day; and 3) the recovery rate fluctuated extremely little on a 1E-03 scale, showing no significant breakthrough in COVID-19 treatment that helped the policy work. Our method can be readily adapted to other countries and SEIR epidemic.},

  abstract     = {Efficient identification of influential nodes is crucial in complex networks due to its significant theoretical and practical implications for information propagation and various applications. Despite numerous approaches being developed, many existing methods rely on centrality metrics that have inherent deficiencies and limitations. These approaches face challenges such as network sparsity and ignoring relationships between distant nodes. To address these issues, this article proposes an efficient and influential node identification approach named semilocal (SL) average shortest path with augmented graph (ASPAG). We configure the average shortest path (ASP) theory with the extended neighborhood concept to address the network sparsity problem with less complexity. The aim is to develop a SL centrality metric based on ASP that can extract a local subgraph for each node in a distributed manner. ASPAG, on the other hand, uses a combined augmented graph and the SL ASP centrality metric to improve the representation of global relationships in the network and make the most of relationships between nodes that are far apart. By leveraging local topological information and incorporating additional graph structures, our method provides a comprehensive analysis of node influence. Extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that ASPAG outperforms traditional centrality metrics and other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of computational efficiency. Specifically, ASPAG improves Kendall’s τ coefficient under the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model by 4.6% compared to the best available method.},

Deep neural networks have been widely applied in the area of knowledge tracing and have demonstrated encouraging results. Nevertheless, in real-world scenarios, there is a substantial amount of noise in students’ response records. These noises may amplify the inherent risk of overfitting in deep neural networks, leading to a decrease in model performance. To address these issues, we introduce a new model called filter knowledge tracing (FKT). This innovative model incorporates a learnable filter into KT to filter out noise information from students’ exercise sequences. We redefine the input paradigm of the data, using learnable filters to perform filtering operations in its frequency domain representation space, effectively removing noise. Additionally, an attention module has been introduced in the FKT model to evaluate the impact of students’ historical interactions on their current knowledge state. To validate our model, we conduct extensive experiments utilizing four publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that FKT outperforms existing benchmarks, particularly on larger datasets, signifying an improvement in KT performance while effectively reducing the risk of overfitting.},

However, we face significant challenges in isolated attribute manipulation and balancing the tradeoff between editing fidelity and facial identity preservation. Here, this article presents a novel approach to constructing an orthogonal decomposition subspace, enabling precise editing control over individual attributes with minimal impact on others and maintaining identity consistency. We introduce an adaptive weight modulation (AWM) method and a maximum slope truncation (MST) formula. The AWM method, founded on a sufficient convergent criterion, performs singular value decomposition to yield subspace parameters that preserve rich facial knowledge within the generative model, facilitating high-quality facial generation with reduced parameterization. This empowers meaningful semantic interpretation of attributes, supporting diverse editing tasks such as pose, age, and eyewear adjustments. The MST formula rigorously defines the editing bounds to effectively navigate the tradeoff between editing depth and identity retention. We also propose a guideline for deciphering the specific meanings of unsupervised semantics, potentially advancing interpretability in social behavioral studies. An accompanying web application, available at https://github.com/mickoluan/GreenLimeSia, has been developed, granting users the freedom to perform tailored facial edits.

This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in India, where the intricate political and communal landscape provided fertile ground. The misinformation, with its elements of hate speech, posed a significant threat to societal cohesion. In response, this article delves into the dynamics of misinformation during the COVID-19 crisis in India, with a specific focus on differentiating general misinformation (GM) from hateful misinformation (HM). To this end, we construct an Indian COVID-19 misinformation dataset collected from various online social and mainstream media and analyze it from various perspectives. Mainly, we focus on temporal evolution, content and topics involved, and emotions and sentiment sensationalism of COVID-19 misinformation. We found the emotions of sadness and fear as key amplifiers of misinformation in general, with negative sentiments dominating HM. Through our comprehensive analysis, we found many such interesting insights and patterns. We also perform hate detection within misinformation content using various unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. Our results show that while GM is relatively easier to identify, it is challenging to detect HM. Overall, deep learning models are found to be more effective than unsupervised methods. By discovering key insights and patterns, this study serves as a foundation for developing robust strategies to combat information disorder.},

The selection of a profile picture in social media is crucial as it serves as a visual representation of virtual identity. It not only reflects the user&#39;s personality but also influences the level of empathy and identification that others feel toward them. However, the potential impact of profile pictures with different styles (e.g., real faces, cartoon faces, and landscape images) on empathy and identity recognition is still unclear. To explore its effects, a controlled laboratory experiment and an ecological online experiment were conducted. Participants were shown a picture each time, informed to imagine interacting with the person using it as his/her profile picture, and instructed to rate an item from the basic empathy scale (BES) based on it. After rating all pictures, users then completed an identity recognition task. Results show that participants’ empathy scores for users with cartoon or real face profile pictures are greater than those with landscape profile pictures. In addition, participants performed better in identity recognition for users with real face or landscape images as profile pictures than for those with cartoon face profile pictures. Moreover, users of social media often make social categorizations (i.e., in-group/out-group categorization) based on the social identities expressed by their profile pictures. Our results also indicate that the affective empathy scale rating score was positively associated with the degree to which users of the corresponding profile pictures were categorized as in-group members.},

However, most CF methods represent users and items as fixed points in the latent space, lacking the ability to capture uncertainty. While probabilistic embedding is proposed to intergrate uncertainty, they suffer from several limitations when introduced to graph-based recommender systems. Graph convolutional network framework would confuse the semantic of uncertainty in the nodes, and similarity measured by Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence suffers from degradation problem and demands an exponential number of samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, called the Wasserstein dependent Graph ATtention network (W-GAT), for collaborative filtering with uncertainty. We utilize GAT and Wasserstein distance to learn Gaussian embedding for each user and item. Additionally, our method incorporates Wasserstein-dependent mutual information further to increase the similarity between positive pairs. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the superiority of W-GAT compared to several representative baselines. Extensive experimental analysis validates the effectiveness of W-GAT in capturing uncertainty by modeling the range of user preferences and categories associated with items.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, shared social images often contain multiple privacy subjects, and the disclosure of these privacy subjects increases the risk of privacy violations; thus, the protection of visual privacy is particularly important. However, existing means of visual privacy protection render images unavailable and are typically protected only for images with a single privacy subject. Combining compressed sensing (CS) and 2DCS, this article proposes a multilevel visual privacy protection scheme (MLVPP) via thumbnail preservation (TPE) and key sharing (KS), which includes two stages, that is, CS-TPE multilevel encryption and KS multilevel decryption. In the first stage, we utilize 2DCS to enable the compressed sampled observations to preserve the structural similarity of the nonsensitive part and leverage CS to encrypt multiple sensitive parts of the image. The CS-processed image is then made to strike a good balance between privacy and availability through TPE. In the second stage, with the help of KS mechanism, the CS encryption keys and TPE key are shared in different combinations with the users related to the privacy subjects for meeting the MLVPP requirements. The quality of decrypted images varies for different classes of related users, e.g., unrelated users, semirelated users, and full-related users. The proposed approach preserves the visual information in the nonsensitive part of the image while providing security for the sensitive parts. Compared with related works, MLVPP reveals that the PSNR of the fully decrypted image can reach 34.04, and the SSIM is greater than 0.96 at a compression rate of 0.25. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MLVPP.},

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to multiple influencing factors, its nonlinear and volatile nature, and complex interdependencies. Recent approaches have neglected the interconnections between stocks and relied on predefined static relationships. The collection of relational data is difficult to access due to confidentiality and privacy agreements for emerging economies. Moreover, these predefined relationships lack the ability to explain the latent interactions between stocks. This work proposes a data-driven end-to-end framework, dynamic relation aware relational temporal network (DR2TNet), that learns the hidden intra- and intersector associations between stock pairs and temporal patterns. A financial knowledge graph is built from historical data and is updated dynamically during the training process to reflect the interactions between the stocks according to the current market situation. We have proposed a new loss function that considers prediction loss and directional movement loss to train a model. The applicability of prediction results obtained by DR2TNet is demonstrated in the portfolio optimization problem. The results show a higher return compared to other existing baseline models.},

To effectively manage the resilience of healthcare systems, it is essential to model their working domains. Furthermore, healthcare systems at different levels have distinct structures and substance flow characteristics. In particular, at the departmental level, the substance flow is primarily patient-centric, while at the hospital level, it includes orders, bills, and report flows. Interhospital scenarios may involve case flows and healthcare personnel movements. Therefore, this article proposes a healthcare system domain modeling framework based on the function-context-behavior-principle-state-structure (FCBPSS) tool, outlining its application in three hierarchical healthcare system levels. Unlike FCBPSS applications in other systems engineering fields, this framework not only captures the system&#39;s semantics but also encompasses ethical rules and operational standards within the healthcare system, making it an ideal tool for healthcare system domain modeling. Finally, the model&#39;s effectiveness is validated through the optimization of a case study at Sheng-Jing Hospital in Shenyang.},

  abstract     = {Social media platforms have become an open door for users to share their views, resulting in a growing trend of offensive content being shared on social media. Detecting and addressing offensive content is crucial due to its significant impact on society. Although there has been extensive research on the detection of offensive content in the English language, there is a notable gap in detecting offensive content in multimodal settings involving code-mixed languages. In this article, we propose a large scale multimodal code-mixed dataset for Hinglish (Hindi+English) MultiSEAO-Mix focusing on women and children. The MultiSEAO-Mix is annotated with offensiveness, sentiment, emotion, and their respective intensities. Additionally, it is also annotated with author support. A multimodal, multitask framework is proposed that considers offensive detection, intensity prediction, and author support as the primary tasks and improves their performance using sentiment, emotion, and corresponding intensities as the auxiliary tasks. Further, we propose a fusion technique that captures the enhanced multimodal representation to improve the performance of our model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multitask framework improves the model performance by more than 4.5 points compared to multitask system without sentiment and emotion as the auxiliary tasks.},

  abstract     = {A large population embraced social media to share thoughts, emotions, and daily experiences through text, images, audio, or video posts. This user-generated content (UGC) serves various purposes, including user profiling, sentiment analysis, and disease detection or tracking. Notably, researchers recognized the potential of UGC for assessing mental health due to its unobtrusive and real-time monitoring capabilities. Recent reviews on depression identification from textual UGC using AI models covered tools and techniques but overlooked critical components such as datasets, lexicons, features, and subtasks, which are essential for understanding the progress and tasks undertaken. This survey adopts a systematic approach and formulates five research questions to examine the relevant literature concerning these elements. Additionally, it organizes machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) training features from textual UGC in a hierarchical manner and maps the literature on depression detection into various subtasks. The review highlights that despite the prevalence studies, datasets are limited in both quantity and size, with many relying on less reliable ground truth collection methods such as self-reported diagnosis statements (SRDS). Furthermore, the review identifies an overemphasis on certain textual features, such as n-grams and affective elements, while others, such as life events, egocentric graphs, and intervention/coping style, remain largely unexplored. It is crucial for practical AI depression detection systems to develop expertise in tasks such as severity, symptom detection, and explainable/interpretable depression analysis to instill confidence and trust among users.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a major mental health issue in contemporary society, with an estimated 350 million people affected globally. The number of individuals diagnosed with depression continues to rise each year. Currently, clinical practice relies entirely on self-reporting and clinical assessment, which carries the risk of subjective biases. In this article, we propose a multimodal method based on facial expression and pupil to detect depression more objectively and precisely. Our method first extracts the features of facial expressions and pupil diameter using residual networks and 1-D convolutional neural networks. Second, a cross-modal fusion model based on self-attention networks (CMF-SNs) is proposed, which utilizes cross-modal attention networks within modalities and parallel self-attention networks between different modalities to extract CMF features of facial expressions and pupil diameter, effectively complementing information between different modalities. Finally, the obtained features are fully connected to identify depression. Multiple controlled experiments show that compared to single modality, the multimodal fusion method based on self-attention networks has a higher ability to recognize depression, with the highest accuracy of 75.0%. In addition, we conducted comparative experiments under three different stimulation paradigms, and the results showed that the classification accuracy under negative and neutral stimuli was higher than that under positive stimuli, indicating a bias of depressed patients toward negative images. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our multimodal fusion method.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of e-commerce, where online shopping has become a staple of daily life, the generation of personalized product descriptions presents a unique challenge and opportunity for enhancing customer experience. Traditional retail interactions allow for personalized communication between salespersons and customers, ensuring that consumer needs are directly addressed. This level of personalization is harder to achieve online, where customers must navigate through generic, often lengthy product descriptions to make informed purchasing decisions. Recognizing the dual necessity of personalizing content to individual preferences while ensuring the descriptions remain faithful to the product&#39;s core attributes, this article introduces a novel approach, the gated pointer-generator transformer (GPGT). This framework is designed to bridge the gap between customer preferences and product features, enabling the generation of descriptions that are not only customized to the user&#39;s interests—such as emphasizing appearance for fashion-forward individuals or functionality for tech enthusiasts—but also accurately reflect the product&#39;s distinctive qualities, including brand names and technical specifications. GPGT leverages the select-attention mechanism combined with a Transformer encoder to capture the nuanced interactions between user attributes and product features, further refined by a copy mechanism during the decoding phase for the precise inclusion of specific product-related terms. Extensive experiments show that our framework substantially improves the quality of generation ($+$10.6% on ROUGE-2 and $+$15.9% on BLEU) while being more faithful to draw people&#39;s attention. The results on human evaluation, in terms of fluency, faithfulness, and personalization, also exhibit that descriptions generated by GPGT can be better accepted by real users.},

However, due to the influence of time, space, and other factors, the problem of integrity becomes severe in the real trading environment. As the platforms, sellers, and consumers are the main participants and their decision-making is restricted by historical experiences and contextual conditions, they exhibit constrained rationality. Utilizing evolutionary game theory, the study constructs a tripartite game model that analyses the influence of relevant parameters on the behavior of the participants. To deal with the behaviors of the participants, we built a simulation system on MATLAB to demonstrate the effects of beginning circumstances and associated parameter adjustments on the evolution outcomes for participants. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation analysis, we identify that the e-commerce platforms should standardize the good faith behavior of sellers by increasing the punishment, which can reduce the malicious return behavior of consumers. Sellers can mitigate the probability of fraud by improving production technology. Consumers can improve their learning to avoid returning products. This research provides a theoretical framework and decision support for e-commerce platforms, and it also promotes the long-term growth of online transactions.},

  abstract     = {The multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) is widely used for analyzing data streams that interact with each other, where events generate new events within their own dimension (via self-excitation) or across different dimensions (via cross excitation). However, in certain applications, the timestamps of individual events in some dimensions are unobservable, and only event counts within intervals are known, referred to as partially interval-censored data. The MHP is unsuitable for handling such data since its estimation requires event timestamps. In this study, we introduce the partially censored multivariate Hawkes process (PCMHP), a novel point process that shares parameter equivalence with the MHP and can effectively model both timestamped and interval-censored data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the PCMHP using synthetic and real-world datasets. First, we illustrate that the PCMHP can approximate MHP parameters and recover the spectral radius using synthetic event histories. Next, we assess the performance of the PCMHP in predicting YouTube popularity and find that the PCMHP outperforms the popularity estimation algorithm Hawkes intensity process (HIP) [1]. Comparing with the fully interval-censored HIP, we show that the PCMHP improves prediction performance by accounting for point process dimensions, particularly when there exist significant cross-dimension interactions. Last, we leverage the PCMHP to gain qualitative insights from a dataset comprising daily COVID-19 case counts from multiple countries and COVID-19-related news articles. By clustering the PCMHP-modeled countries, we unveil hidden interaction patterns between occurrences of COVID-19 cases and news reporting.},

  abstract     = {While the development of e-commerce brings convenience to consumers, a large quantity of products and information increase the difficulty of making purchase decisions. This study constructs a classification-based product selection method driven by online reviews to assist consumers in making purchase decisions. First, the multifaceted attribute evaluations of products are extracted from textual reviews that contain more abundant and useful information than those provided by vendors. The evaluations are modeled by probabilistic linguistic term sets such that sentiment words in texts are described at different frequencies. Then, a classification-based product selection method is developed to rank products considering multifaceted attributes in which alternative products are divided into the acceptance class, rejection class, and uncertainty class through a classification strategy. Each class of products is compared based on the performance scores calculated by a probabilistic linguistic aggregation operator. A case study of selecting laptops based on real data from Amazon.com is given to illustrate the method. Comparative analysis with existing ranking methods shows the advantages of the proposed method in matching consumers’ risk aversion behavior and preserving uncertain information.},
