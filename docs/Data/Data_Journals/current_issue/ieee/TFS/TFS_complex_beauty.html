  abstract     = {Dynamic models are indispensable for the optimization, prediction, and control of thermal comfort in buildings. This article proposes a new method for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of radiator-heated buildings and measuring model uncertainties. Specifically, a nonlinear dynamic model is established according to the heat conservation between independent heat storage units in heating buildings. The model uncertainties are measured based on the fuzzy set theory by a number of sub-optimal parameter vectors that reproduce certain measured outputs and approach the optimal value of a modeling objective function. These sub-optimal parameter vectors can describe the uncertainties in the presence of model structure deviations and unknown noise distributions, without making restrictive assumptions that the noise follows a Gaussian distribution as in existing methods. The proposed method is validated by practical examples in a radiator-heated residential building. The examples illustrate that the proposed method can provide more accurate measurements of the model uncertainties than the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.},

  abstract     = {Networked control systems (NCSs) suffer from various communication imperfections, including varying transmission intervals, packet losses, and false data injection (FDI) attacks. The majority of the existing literature on NCSs tends to emphasize certain aspects while neglecting others. In this article, we propose a general framework for addressing the stabilization problem of networked nonlinear systems that incorporates multiple stochastic transmission intervals (MSTIs), successive packet losses (SPLs), and FDI attacks. We assume that the nonlinear system can be precisely modeled using a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system. MSTIs can be described using the categorical distribution, while both the sensor-to-controller channel and the controller-to-actuator channel are affected by SPLs and FDI attacks. In order to facilitate the stabilization problem, we first establish the equivalent stochastic transmission interval between adjacent nonpacket-loss instants, where the occurrence probability of the length of the equivalent transmission interval can be accurately calculated by using the probabilistic information of SPLs and MSTIs. Furthermore, considering two-channel FDI attacks, a discrete-time T–S fuzzy system model is obtained. The controller design conditions, represented by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), are derived based on this model. Specifically, using a novel matrix reconstruction approach, the dimension of the obtained controller design condition does not change with the number of maximum packet losses and the number of MSTIs, which is more general than existing results and avoids the high computational complexity associated with solving LMIs in some cases. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example.},

To overcome the challenges brought by the introduction of nonlinear coupling strengths, this article adopts a Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model to characterize the nonlinear variation of coupling strengths reasonably. Then, in the framework of average impulsive interval applicable to a wider range of impulsive signals, this article proposes a novel method for analyzing the fixed-time stability of impulsive systems, which not only loosens the restriction of the derivative of the Lyapunov function in the existing studies, but also gives a more accurate estimation of the settling time, and more importantly, provides a theoretical basis for designing appropriate impulsive signals to modulate the dynamic behavior of SNs toward achieving the desired goal. Based on the newly suggested method, this article derives a unified synchronization criterion suitable for evaluating the implementation of FxTBS of SNs under both desynchronizing and synchronizing impulses.

The complex knowledge comes from a proposed hybrid NFN-LSTM model (teacher) composed of a long shor-term memory (LSTM) coupled to a neo-fuzzy neuron (NFN) structure. The proposed student model, the NFN-MOD, is an explainable Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model that resembles modular characteristics to mimic the temporal memory of the LSTM part in the teacher model. The NFN-MOD is adaptable across many scenarios, including solo learning (without a teacher), with the estimation of a previously trained teacher, or training in parallel with the teacher. The complexity reduction of the student model is achieved through the pruning of its consequent parameters with the lowest L1-norm. Application of NFN-MOD in industrial case studies (sulfur recovery unit and cement manufacturing process) demonstrates the efficiency of NFN-MOD in distilling complex knowledge from the teacher model NFN-LSTM, with emphasis on parallel training and parameter pruning. In addition, a novel explainability analysis is introduced, which evaluates the influence of antecedent parameters of the student model in relation to the expected real system output.},

Then, based on the residual signals generated by the filter, a generalized detection scheme for sensor faults and actuator faults is proposed. By applying the information about membership functions and relaxation matrices, the existence conditions of the filter are obtained that guarantee the stochastic stability and strict dissipativity of the filtering error system.

  abstract     = {Although the construction of multilinear trend fuzzy information granules (FIG) achieves a win–win situation in terms of interpretability and trend extraction, in its second stage of segmentation, the equal-length segmentation will result in the loss of local trend. The granulation effect will further affect the forecasting performance of the time series. To this end, this article establishes a convolutional neural network (CNN) prediction method based on improved multilinear trend FIGs. First, considering the natural cycle characteristics of the time series, this article establishes a time series segmentation algorithm based on the valley points, which replaces the equal-length segmentation in the second stage of the construction of the multilinear trend FIGs, thus enhancing the interpretability of the granulation process. Later, an evaluation index of Gaussian fuzzy information granules (GLFIGs) is proposed for improving the trend extraction effect of each multilinear trend FIG. Since the multilinear trend FIGs are constructed in the natural period segment, in order to fully exploit the correlation of the corresponding positions of each granule to enhance the prediction accuracy, a GLFIG correspondence algorithm based on the segmentation and merging is introduced in this article. Finally, CNN is selected as the prediction model based on the data characteristics. We conduct experiments on six datasets and two artificial cycle datasets, and compare the constructed model with commonly used prediction models and the latest granularity model. At last, the experiments reveal that our model performs better.},

However, most state-of-the-art methods suffer from limitations due to not only using the single-scale information granulation but also the lack of trend information. As a result, the prediction models are difficult to capture the multiscale temporal dependencies and dynamic behavior of time series. To address these problems, this article proposes a multiscale information granule-based time series forecasting model. First, the trend-based information granulation strategy is proposed to generate trend information granules that can capture dynamic behavior and trend information in an incremental manner. Then, the multiscale fusion mechanism is proposed to form multiscale information granules with diversified information, which fuses local and global information at different scales. Finally, the two-stage prediction mechanism is proposed to capture multiscale temporal dependencies and perform long-term prediction. A series of experiments were conducted on publicly available time series. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed method outperforms existing numeric models and granular models in long-term prediction on regular and large data time series.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multilabel feature selection (MFS) has gained considerable attention as a key technique in the field of data mining. Embedded methods have been widely adopted due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, most embedded MFS methods assume that all labels share the same feature space. Although previous works have noted this issue and proposed solutions, they still suffer from the inability to accurately identify a specific subset of features for each label. Furthermore, most embedded MFS methods often only consider feature similarity through manifold learning concepts, neglecting the impact of feature redundancy, leading to suboptimal performance. In addition, their weight matrix is usually derived from a single perspective of the loss function. To address these limitations, we propose a novel embedded label-specific MFS method based on fuzzy implication granularity information called LSFSFI. This method uses the partial fuzzy mutual implication granularity information to capture the relationships between labels and features, and introduces an auxiliary matrix to achieve label-specific feature selection, which provides a new perspective for the calculation of the weight matrix. In addition, the normalized fuzzy mutual implication granularity information is used to describe the redundancy between features, and a new redundancy constraint regularization term is proposed to ensure a more reasonable assignment of feature weights. Experimental results on several multilabel datasets show that LSFSFI outperforms existing methods in terms of both performance and practicality.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the adaptive fuzzy fixed-time bipartite consensus tracking control problem is studied for stochastic nonlinear multi-agent systems with unknown control gains and time-varying output constraints. First, in order to address the difficulties arising from the unknown control gains, the Nussbaum technique is employed. In the meantime, the $tan$-type nonlinear mapping function is introduced, which guarantees the predefined output constraints are not violated. Then, different from the previous control strategies in which they only focused on the balanced directed topology, the classification optimization algorithm is presented to accomplish the bipartite consensus tracking control according to the structurally unbalanced directed topology. Besides, by combining the adaptive backstepping technique with the adding power integration methodology, the nonsingular fixed-time control strategy is proposed. The proposed adaptive fuzzy fixed-time control strategy ensures that the bipartite consensus tracking errors converge to a region near zero in fixed time and all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability. Last, the effectiveness of the presented control scheme is demonstrated with a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Long-term forecasting for time series is gaining significant attention in many emerging fields, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Linear fuzzy information granulation is a well-recognized and powerful tool for long-term forecasting. However, existing studies on this topic have been restricted to univariate time series, falling short of meeting the real-world demands of complex forecasting issues. In this regard, this article proposes a multivariate long-term time-series forecasting model using fuzzy information granules and demonstrates its application to a transportation forecasting task. Our model begins by designing a multilinear trend fuzzy information granulation scheme within a justifiable granularity framework. This scheme effectively granulates and delineates time-series information for each feature. To ensure the normalization of the granular time series within each time window, we propose a scale equalization strategy that leverages the dynamic time warping algorithm. Building upon this foundation, our model introduces a long-term forecasting mechanism for multivariate time series. Notably, this mechanism fosters interconnections, bridging the temporal gap between past and future granular time series while concurrently linking the granular series of influential features and the target feature. Empirical validation on six real-world traffic flow forecasting datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Distribution linguistic preference relations (DLPRs) play a crucial role in group decision making due to their ability to capture hesitation and uncertainty in individual judgments. By utilizing multiple linguistic variables with associated distribution proportions, DLPRs offer a flexible way to represent preferences. However, current models that use DLPRs often overlook two crucial factors: the ordinal consistency of preference relations and the fairness of adjustment allocation within the DLPRs-based consensus reaching process. In this article, we propose a cooperative game-based minimum adjustment consensus reaching mechanism that accounts for both ordinal consistency and the hesitant degree in DLPRs. This approach leverages the properties of indices in cooperative game theory to ensures a fair allocation of consistency and consensus adjustments, while maintaining ordinal consistency and controlling the hesitant degree of DLPRs through the construction of appropriate constraints to preserve their quality. In addition, a new algorithm is developed to manage completeness, ordinal and acceptable cardinal consistency, consensus-reaching, and hesitation in scenarios involving incomplete DLPRs. Finally, a case study is provided to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed method. Sensitivity and comparative analyzes with existing models are performed to assess the performance of the approach in terms of quality, fairness, and efficiency.},

The new Lyapunov inequality with a unified exponent condition is proposed, which can reduce the input of redundant system-independent parameters. Some existing results on the FxT stability lemmas are improved. Considering that the states cannot converge to the origin accurately, completely-intermittent-type practical FxT stability lemmas are further investigated, which can be regarded as the first one and the problem of constructing the practical FxT stability lemmas under the completely-intermittent mechanism is solved. From the perspective of saving information resources to the greatest extent, by designing the quantized controllers, the intermittent FxT and practical FxT control of the addressed DTSFCNs are studied. Here, the quantized controller only works in intermittent intervals, which can improve the quantized controllers and intermittent controllers.

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in processing graph structure. Due to the diversity and complexity of real-world graph data, heterogeneous GCN have attracted significant attention. However, existing research predominantly relies on explicit connections to explore graph heterogeneity. In the case of edgeless graphs, such as information systems, the absence of direct edges poses a significant challenge for employing GCNs to analyze the latent heterogeneity within these graphs. Traditional approaches overlook the topological features of information systems, resulting in information loss. This article introduces a heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network based on shadowed deviation relationship (SDHGCN) to investigate the heterogeneity of information systems, thereby improving the generalizability of heterogeneous GCNs. First, shadow deviation relationship and attribute deviation relationship are constructed derived from shadow sets and information gain, respectively. Then, dexterously integrated with the feature matrix of the information system (the relationship between objects and attributes), a highly expressive heterogeneous graph is constructed. Second, by performing graph convolution operations on the heterogeneous graph, effective node representations can be obtained to complete node classification tasks. Finally, the effectiveness and nonrandomness of SDHGCN are validated by extensive comparison and ablation experiments.},

Then, a novel parameter integration approach is constructed via the fuzzy approximation technique to reduce the computational burden, where the uncertainty terms (state errors, composite errors, fuzzy weights, and injection attacks) can be converted into a linear parameterized form with merely one unknown scalar. In addition, a set of MTBFs is designed to prevent the excessive overshoot or jitter of system errors in the transient-state performance. Furthermore, an adaptive dynamic event-triggered control strategy is constructed on the basis of the auxiliary dynamic variable. All the closed-loop signals are shown to be bounded, and the followers can achieve the synchronous tracking of the leader&#39;s output.

Specifically, the fluctuations of the state estimator gain parameters are taken into account in the design of the filter. Further, cyber attacks are supposed to take place in the communication channel and can modify the sensor signals by injecting false data if an attack is successful. Meanwhile, the transition probability of the Markov process is a switching phenomenon along with the minimum and maximum bounds of the multichannel communication scheme. By employing appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional along with reciprocally convex approach, a set of sufficient conditions guaranteeing the finite-time mixed $H_\infty$ and passivity performance for NCSs are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

This dramatically reduced the rule-base size, by 97.7%, while maintaining global operating environment coverage. The stability analysis proved the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop controller-vehicle system. In addition, test courses were used to examine the effects of steering disturbance, phase lag, and overshoot as expressed in root mean square error (RMSE) and max error (ME). Outdoor experimental results for the controller&#39;s performance were contrasted with a benchmark waypoint navigation controller, pure pursuit, and a simpler implementation that only output linear speed. The controller was found to outperform the pure pursuit and simpler implementation experimentally by 72% and 50% in RMSE, 71% and 40% in ME, validating the controllers viability.},
