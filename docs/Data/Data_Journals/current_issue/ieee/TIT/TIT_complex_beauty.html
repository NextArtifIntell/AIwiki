  abstract     = {The purpose of this note is to correct an error made by Con et al. (2023), specifically in the proof of Theorem 9. Here we correct the proof but as a consequence we get a slightly weaker result. In Theorem9, we claimed that for integers k and n such that $k \lt n/9$ , there exists an $[n,k]_{q}$ RS code that can decode from $n-2k+1$ insdel errors where $q = O\left ({{k^{5} \left ({{ \frac {en}{k-1} }}\right)^{4k-4}}}\right)$ . Here we prove the following. Theorem 1: For integers n and $k \lt n/9$ , there exists an $[n,k]_{q}$ RS-code, where $q=O\left ({{k^{4} \cdot \left ({{\frac {4en}{4k-3}}}\right)^{4k-3}}}\right)$ is a prime power, that can decode from $n - 2k + 1$ adversarial insdel errors. Note that the exponent of n is $4k-3$ whereas in Theorem 9 it is $4k-4$ . For constant dimensional codes, the field size is of order $O(n^{4k-3})$ , and in particular, for $k=2$ the field size is of order $O(n^{5})$ .},

  abstract     = {This paper explores Bayesian lower bounds on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) that belong to the well-known Ziv-Zakai family. The Ziv-Zakai technique relies on connecting the bound to an $\mathsf M$ -ary hypothesis testing problem. There are three versions of the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB): the first version relies on the so-called valley-filling function, the second one is a relaxation of the first bound which omits the valley-filling function, and the third one, namely the single-point ZZB (SZZB), replaces the integration present in the first two bounds with a single point maximization. The first part of this paper focuses on providing the most general version of the bounds. It is shown that these bounds hold without any assumption on the distribution of the estimand. This makes the bounds applicable to discrete and mixed distributions. Then, the SZZB is extended to an $\mathsf M$ -ary setting and a version of it that holds for the multivariate setting is provided. In the second part, general properties of these bounds are provided. First, unlike the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound, it is shown that all the versions of the ZZB tensorize. Second, a characterization of the high-noise asymptotic is provided, which is used to argue about the tightness of the bounds. Third, a complete low-noise asymptotic is provided under the assumptions of mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. In the low-noise, it is shown that the ZZB is generally tight, but there are examples for which the SZZB is not tight. In the third part, the tightness of the bounds is evaluated. First, it is shown that in the low-noise regime the ZZB without the valley-filling function, and, therefore, also the ZZB with the valley-filling function, are tight for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Second, for discrete inputs it is shown that the ZZB with the valley-filling function is always sub-optimal, and equal to zero without the valley-filling function. Third, unlike for the ZZB, an example is shown for which the SZZB is tight to the MMSE for discrete inputs. Fourth, sufficient and necessary conditions for the tightness of the bounds are provided. Finally, some examples are provided in which the bounds in the Ziv-Zakai family outperform other well-known Bayesian lower bounds, namely the Cramér-Rao bound and the maximum entropy bound.},

  abstract     = {Aperiodic autocorrelation is an important indicator of performance of sequences used in communications, remote sensing, and scientific instrumentation. Knowing a sequence’s autocorrelation function, which reports the autocorrelation at every possible translation, is equivalent to knowing the magnitude of the sequence’s Fourier transform. The phase problem is the difficulty in resolving this lack of phase information. We say that two sequences are equicorrelational to mean that they have the same aperiodic autocorrelation function. Sequences used in technological applications often have restrictions on their terms: they are not arbitrary complex numbers, but come from a more restricted alphabet. For example, binary sequences involve terms equal to only +1 and −1. We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for two sequences to be equicorrelational, where we take their alphabet into consideration. There are trivial forms of equicorrelationality arising from modifications that predictably preserve the autocorrelation, for example, negating a binary sequence or reversing the order of its terms. By a search of binary sequences up to length 44, we find that nontrivial equicorrelationality among binary sequences does occur, but is rare. An integer n is said to be equivocal when there are binary sequences of length n that are nontrivially equicorrelational; otherwise n is unequivocal. For $n \leq 44$ , we found that the unequivocal lengths are 1–8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 19, 22, 23, 26, 29, 37, and 38. We pose open questions about the finitude of unequivocal numbers and the probability of nontrivial equicorrelationality occurring among binary sequences.},

  abstract     = {Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves, that is, the sequences must have small aperiodic autocorrelation at every nonzero shift. If f is a sequence, then the demerit factor of f is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing f to unit Euclidean norm. The demerit factor is the reciprocal of Golay’s merit factor, and low demerit factor indicates low self-similarity of a sequence under translation. We endow the $2^{\ell } $ binary sequences of length $\ell $ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell $ . These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$ , the pth central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$ . This article shows that for every p, the pth central moment is $\ell ^{-2 p}$ times a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell $ with rational coefficients. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell $ tends to infinity, the pth standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.},

  abstract     = {Plagued by slow or failing workers (also known as stragglers), the speedup gain assumed by distributed learning often falls short. Although substantial efforts have been devoted to mitigating this straggling effect with coding-theoretic techniques, existing pioneering works often suffer from two issues: dense combination and inflexibility. In particular, a code that involves dense combination of sub-tasks may destroy sparsity and lead to heavy workload. In contrast, an inflexible code that conservatively designs its computation procedure according to the presumed maximum number of stragglers may entail unnecessary redundancy when the actual number of stragglers is small. To this end, a generic framework based on matrix splitting is proposed in this work to construct sparse and flexible codes. Specifically, by splitting an original sparse coding matrix into two sparser sub-matrices, a two-layer coded computation that maintains sparsity can be created accordingly. In the meantime, when the actual number of stragglers is small, the computation may be flexibly terminated at layer-one without executing layer-two, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Based on this framework, a novel flexible Bernoulli code is proposed. In addition, by deriving a lower bound in closed-form through the lens of a bipartite graph, its decoding probability is shown to be high and asymptotically one. Moreover, extensive simulations including an application in distributed learning of LeNet are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {We study the Distributed Wireless Link Scheduling (DWLS) problem: there is a set of n autonomous stations, called senders, each with a message to be delivered to some other station, called receiver. The names and locations of all stations are arbitrarily selected and unknown to each other, to mirror an arbitrary scenario that may occur in mobile communication. Each pair ((sender,receiver),message) is called a request, and the event of successfully delivering the message is called the realization of the request. In the DWLS problem, the requests are realized through wireless communication links (which is a conceptual notion of two nodes being capable of direct wireless delivery of a message) between the stations. The decision to transmit a message is made locally by each station. We consider networks where communication links may interfere with each other, where the interference is an arbitrary input function of each pair of links, customarily called affectance; if the total affectance of other links whose senders are currently transmitting is above a given threshold, the considered transmission is not successful. In the above context, we study the impact of the number of truly random bits used by each link/sender, on the length of the transmission schedules. Specifically, for any set L of n requests with maximum average affectance $A(L)$ , we present a deterministic algorithm (i.e., 0 random bits) and a randomized algorithm using $O(\log A(L)\log n)$ random bits per link. (In this abstract we present formulas in simplified forms, for brevity.) The lengths of their transmission schedules are $O(A(L)^{2}\log ^{3} n)$ and $O(A(L)\log n)$ , respectively. We then combine both approaches to get a randomized solution using $O(\log W \log n)$ truly random bits per station with schedules of length $O\left ({{\frac {A(L)^{2}}{W}\log n}}\right)$ , for any $W\le A(L)$ . To the best of our knowledge, our study is a first step towards understanding the trade-offs between randomness and time complexity of Link Scheduling under arbitrary interference. It is particularly important as currently used (in practice) wireless protocols are either deterministic or use a very small random seed of (truly) random bits.},

Previous works propose the use of MDS codes to treat the responses from malicious workers as errors and correct them using the error-correction properties of the code. This comes at the expense of increasing the replication, i.e., the number of workers each partial gradient is computed by. In this work, we propose a way to reduce the replication to $ {s} +1$ instead of $2 {s} +1$ in the presence of s malicious workers. Our method detects erroneous inputs from the malicious workers, transforming them into erasures. This comes at the expense of s additional local computations at the main node and additional rounds of light communication between the main node and the workers. We define a general framework and give fundamental limits for fractional repetition data allocations. Our scheme is optimal in terms of replication and local computation and incurs a communication cost that is asymptotically, in the size of the dataset, a multiplicative factor away from the derived bound. We furthermore show how additional redundancy can be exploited to reduce the number of local computations and communication cost, or, alternatively, tolerate straggling workers.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies covert communication over channels with Action-Dependent State Information (ADSI) when the state is available either non-causally or causally at the transmitter. Covert communication refers to reliable communication between a transmitter and a receiver while ensuring a low probability of detection by an adversary, which we refer to as “warden”. It is well known that in a point-to-point Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC), it is possible to communicate on the order of $\sqrt {N}$ bits reliably and covertly over N channel uses while the transmitter and the receiver are required to share a secret key on the order of $\sqrt {N}$ bits. This paper studies achieving reliable and covert communication of positive rate, i.e., reliable and covert communication on the order of N bits in N channel uses, over a channel with ADSI while the transmitter has non-causal or causal access to the ADSI, and the transmitter and the receiver share a secret key of negligible rate. We derive achievable rates for both the non-causal and causal scenarios by using block-Markov encoding and secret key generation from the ADSI, which subsumes the best achievable rates for channels with random states. We also derive upper bounds, for both non-causal and causal scenarios, that meet our achievable rates for some special cases. As an application of our problem setup, we study covert communication over channels with rewrite options, which are closely related to recording covert information on memory, and show that a positive covert rate can be achieved in such channels. As a special case of our problem, we study the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and provide lower and upper bounds on the covert capacity that meet when the transmitter and the receiver share a secret key of sufficient rate and when the warden’s channel is noisier than the legitimate receiver channel. As another application of our problem setup, we show that cooperation can lead to a positive covert rate in Gaussian channels. A few other examples are also worked out in detail.},

The channel is governed by discrete memoryless and i.i.d. channel states, and the channel state information (CSI) is revealed to the encoders in a causal manner. The main results of this paper are inner and outer bounds of the capacity region, for which we investigate coding schemes incorporating wiretap coding and secret key agreements between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Two kinds of block Markov coding schemes are proposed. The first is a new coding scheme that uses backward decoding and the Wyner-Ziv coding, and the secret key is constructed from a lossy description of the CSI. The other is an extended version of an existing coding scheme for point-to-point wiretap channels with causal CSI. A numerical example shows that the achievable region given by the first coding scheme can be strictly larger than the second one. However, these two schemes do not outperform each other in general, and there exist some numerical examples in which each coding scheme achieves some rate pairs that cannot be achieved by another scheme. Our established inner bound reduces to some best-known results in the literature as special cases. We further investigate some capacity-achieving cases for state-dependent multiple access wiretap channels (SD-MAWCs) with degraded message sets. It turns out that the two coding schemes are both optimal in these cases.},

  abstract     = {We consider the federated submodel learning (FSL) problem in a distributed storage system. In the FSL framework, the full learning model at the server side is divided into multiple submodels such that each selected client needs to download only the required submodel(s) and upload the corresponding update(s) in accordance with its local training data. The server comprises multiple independent databases and the full model is stored across these databases. A fundamental problem in FSL is to enable these multiple databases at the parameter server to collectively maintain a consistent view of the global parameters to facilitate parallel computing across distributed clients. In addition, a practically implementable FSL scheme should possess high throughput, efficient performance, fault tolerance, sufficient privacy, adequate security, certifiable stability, elastic scalability and easy usability features. To specifically resolve the fault tolerance and adequate security issues together, we propose a novel coding mechanism coined ramp secure regenerating coding (RSRC), which is a synthesis of ramp secret sharing and secure regenerating code. This coding technique matches FSL perfectly, as the system performance can be further improved when the full model is stored using RSRC in a distributed manner. By incorporating and extending available techniques cleverly, our new RSRC-based distributed FSL approach that is constructed on top of our earlier two-database FSL scheme which uses private set union (PSU), achieves all of the aforementioned important features. A complete one-round FSL process consists of: 1) an FSL-PSU phase where the union of the submodel indices to be updated by the selected clients in the current round is determined, 2) an FSL-write phase where the updated submodels are written back to the databases, and 3) additional auxiliary phases where sufficient amounts of necessary common randomness are generated at both server and client sides.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding the convergence and generalization properties of gradient-based methods for training overparameterized learning models. However, many aspects including the role of small random initialization and how the various parameters of the model are coupled during gradient-based updates to facilitate good generalization remain largely mysterious. A series of recent papers have begun to study this role for non-convex formulations of symmetric Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrix sensing problems which involve reconstructing a low-rank PSD matrix from a few linear measurements. The underlying symmetry/PSDness is crucial to existing convergence and generalization guarantees for this problem. In this paper, we study a general overparameterized low-rank matrix sensing problem where one wishes to reconstruct an asymmetric rectangular low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements. We prove that an overparameterized model trained via factorized gradient descent converges to the low-rank matrix generating the measurements. We show that in this setting, factorized gradient descent enjoys two implicit properties: (1) coupling of the trajectory of gradient descent where the factors are coupled in various ways throughout the gradient update trajectory and (2) an algorithmic regularization property where the iterates show a propensity towards low-rank models despite the overparameterized nature of the factorized model. These two implicit properties in turn allow us to show that the gradient descent trajectory from small random initialization moves towards solutions that are both globally optimal and generalize well.},

  abstract     = {A more general formulation of the linear bandit problem is considered to allow for dependencies over time. Specifically, it is assumed that there exists an unknown $\mathbb {R}^{d}$ -valued stationary $\varphi $ -mixing sequence of parameters $(\theta _{t}, \; t \in \mathbb {N})$ which gives rise to payoffs. This instance of the problem can be viewed as a generalization of both the classical linear bandits with iid noise, and the finite-armed restless bandits. In light of the well-known computational hardness of optimal policies for restless bandits, an approximation is proposed whose error is shown to be controlled by the $\varphi $ -dependence between consecutive $\theta _{t}$ . An optimistic algorithm, called LinMix-UCB, is proposed for the case where $\theta _{t}$ has an exponential mixing rate. The proposed algorithm is shown to incur a sub-linear regret of $\mathcal {O}\left ({{\sqrt {d n\mathop {\mathrm {polylog}} (n) }}}\right)$ with respect to an oracle that always plays a multiple of $\mathbb {E}\;\theta _{t}$ . The main challenge in this setting is to ensure that the exploration-exploitation strategy is robust against long-range dependencies. The proposed method relies on Berbee’s coupling lemma to carefully select near-independent samples and construct confidence ellipsoids around empirical estimates of $\mathbb {E}\;\theta _{t}$ .},

To address this, we note score functions can often be well-approximated in graphical models through variational inference denoising algorithms. Furthermore, these algorithms can be efficiently represented by neural networks. We demonstrate this through examples, including Ising models, conditional Ising models, restricted Boltzmann machines, and sparse encoding models. Combined with off-the-shelf discretization error bounds for diffusion-based sampling, we provide an efficient sample complexity bound for diffusion-based generative modeling when the score function is learned by deep neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Non-malleable codes are fundamental objects at the intersection of cryptography and coding theory. These codes provide security guarantees even in settings where error correction and detection are impossible, and have found applications to several other cryptographic tasks. One of the strongest and most well-studied adversarial tampering models is 2-split-state tampering. Here, a codeword is split into two parts which are stored in physically distant servers, and the adversary can then independently tamper with each part using arbitrary functions. This model can be naturally extended to the secret sharing setting with several parties by having the adversary independently tamper with each share. Previous works on non-malleable coding and secret sharing in the split-state tampering model only considered the encoding of classical messages. Furthermore, until recent work by Aggarwal, Boddu, and Jain (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2024 &amp; arXiv 2022), adversaries with quantum capabilities and shared entanglement had not been considered, and it is a priori not clear whether previous schemes remain secure in this model. In this work, we introduce the notions of split-state non-malleable codes and secret sharing schemes for quantum messages secure against quantum adversaries with shared entanglement. Then, we present explicit constructions of such schemes that achieve low-error non-malleability. More precisely, for some constant $c\gt 0$ , we construct efficiently encodable and decodable split-state non-malleable codes and secret sharing schemes for quantum messages preserving entanglement with external systems and achieving security against quantum adversaries having shared entanglement with codeword length n, any message length at most $n^{c}$ , and error $\varepsilon =2^{-{n^{c}}}$ . In the easier setting of average-case non-malleability, we achieve efficient non-malleable coding with rate close to $1/11$ .},

This paper delves into the entanglement cost for discriminating two bipartite quantum states, employing positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) with positive partial transpose (PPT) to achieve optimal success probability through general entangled measurements. We first introduce two quantities called the spectral PPT-distance and relative spectral PPT-distance of a POVM to quantify the localness of a general measurement. We show these quantities are related to the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs. Following this, we establish bounds and develop SDP hierarchies to estimate the entanglement cost of optimal discrimination by PPT POVMs for any pair of states. Leveraging these results, we show that a pure state can be optimally discriminated against any other state with the assistance of a single Bell state. This study advances our understanding of the pivotal role played by entanglement in quantum state discrimination, serving as a crucial element in unlocking quantum data hiding against locally constrained measurements.},

The objective of three agents is to faithfully simulate the given distributed quantum measurement acting on the given quantum state while minimizing the communication and shared randomness rates. We demonstrate a new inner bound to the rate region using random structured POVMs based on asymptotically good algebraic codes, and characterize the performance limit using single-letter quantum mutual information quantities. This new bound subsumes the largest known inner bound and improves upon it strictly for identified examples. One of the challenges in analyzing these structured POVMs is that they exhibit only pairwise independence and induce only uniform single-letter distributions.

With such a characterization, we show that the quantum and randomized communication complexity of permutation-invariant Boolean functions are quadratically equivalent (up to a polylogarithmic factor of the input size). Our results extend a recent line of research regarding query complexity to communication complexity, showing symmetry prevents exponential quantum speedups. Furthermore, we show that the Log-rank Conjecture holds for any non-trivial total permutation-invariant Boolean function. Moreover, we establish a relationship between the quantum/classical communication complexity and the approximate rank of permutation-invariant Boolean functions. This implies the correctness of the Log-approximate-rank Conjecture for permutation-invariant Boolean functions in both randomized and quantum settings (up to a polylogarithmic factor of the input size).},

However, in the quantum setting it is not very clear how to construct a measurement which behaves analogously to intersection and union of the typical sets. In this work, we construct a projection operator which behaves very similarly to intersection and union of the typical sets. Our construction relies on the Jordan’s lemma. Using this construction we study the problem of communication over authenticated classical-quantum channels and derive its capacity. As another application of our construction, we also study the problem of quantum asymmetric composite hypothesis testing.},

In addition, we propose two new magic measures, the quantum Ruzsa divergence of magic and quantum-doubling constant, to quantify the amount of magic in quantum states.

The transmitter input can be subject to an additive cost constraint, which specializes to the case of an average energy constraint. This method yields errors that decay exponentially with increasing block lengths. Moreover, it provides a guarantee of a quantum version of semantic security, which is an established concept in classical cryptography and physical layer security. Therefore, it complements existing works which either do not prove the exponential error decay or use weaker notions of security. The main part of this proof method is a direct coding result on channel resolvability which states that there is only a doubly exponentially small probability that a standard random codebook does not solve the channel resolvability problem for the cq channel. Semantic security has strong operational implications meaning essentially that the eavesdropper cannot use its quantum observation to gather any meaningful information about the transmitted signal. We also discuss the connections between semantic security and various other established notions of secrecy.},

A particularly important class of noise models is that of Pauli channels, as randomized compiling techniques can effectively bring any quantum channel to this form and are significantly more structured than general quantum channels. In this paper, we show fundamental lower bounds on the sample complexity for learning Pauli channels in diamond norm. We consider strategies that may not use auxiliary systems entangled with the input to the unknown channel and have to perform a measurement before reusing the channel. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show a lower bound of $\Omega (2^{3n}\varepsilon ^{-2})$ to learn an n-qubit Pauli channel. In particular, this shows that the recently introduced learning procedure by Flammia and Wallman (2020) is essentially optimal. In the adaptive setting, we show a lower bound of $\Omega (2^{2.5n}\varepsilon ^{-2})$ for $\varepsilon ={\mathcal {O}}(2^{-n})$ , and a lower bound of $\Omega (2^{2n}\varepsilon ^{-2})$ for any $\varepsilon \gt 0$ . This last lower bound holds even in a stronger model where in each step, before performing the measurement, the unknown channel may be used arbitrarily many times sequentially interspersed with unital operations.},

In the coherent case, where the channel state information (CSI) is known at the receiver’s side, we characterize the asymptotic capacity and derive the exact scaling in the extreme regimes of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of transmit antennas. In the non-coherent case, where the CSI is unknown but remains constant during T symbol periods, we first obtain the exact asymptotic capacity for $T\le 3$ . Then, we propose a scheme involving uniform signaling in the covariance space and derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the capacity for an arbitrary block size T. Furthermore, we propose a genie-aided upper bound where the channel is revealed to the receiver. We show that the upper and lower bounds coincide when T is large. In the low SNR regime, we derive the asymptotic capacity up to a vanishing term, which, remarkably, matches our capacity lower bound.},

  abstract     = {In order to explore how blind interference alignment (BIA) schemes may take advantage of side-information in computation tasks, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a K user wireless network setting that arises in full-duplex wireless MapReduce applications. In this setting the receivers are assumed to have reconfigurable antennas and channel knowledge, while the transmitters have neither, i.e., the transmitters lack channel knowledge and are only equipped with conventional antennas. The central ingredient of the problem formulation is the message structure arising out of the Shuffle phase of MapReduce, whereby each transmitter has a subset of messages that need to be delivered to various receivers, and each receiver has a subset of messages available to it in advance as side-information. We approach this problem by decomposing it into distinctive stages that help identify key ingredients of the overall solution. The novel elements that emerge from the first stage, called broadcast with groupcast messages, include an outer maximum distance separable (MDS) code structure at the transmitter, and an algorithm for iteratively determining groupcast-optimal reconfigurable antenna switching patterns at the receiver to achieve intra-message (among the symbols of the same message) alignment. The next stage, called unicast with side-information, reveals optimal inter-message (among symbols of different messages) alignment patterns to exploit side-information, and by a relabeling of messages, connects to the desired MapReduce setting.},

  abstract     = {The goal of the trace reconstruction problem is to recover a string $\mathbf {x}\in \{0,1\}^{n}$ given many independent traces of x, where a trace is a subsequence obtained from deleting bits of x independently with some given probability $p\in [0,1$ ). A recent result of Chase (STOC 2021) shows how x can be determined (in exponential time) from $\exp ({O}(n^{1/5})\log ^{5} n)$ traces. This is the state-of-the-art result on the sample complexity of trace reconstruction. In this paper we consider two kinds of algorithms for the trace reconstruction problem. We first observe that the bound of Chase, which is based on statistics of arbitrary length-k subsequences, can also be obtained by considering the “k-mer statistics”, i.e., statistics regarding occurrences of contiguous k-bit strings (a.k.a, k-mers) in the initial string x, for $k = 2n^{1/5}$ . Mazooji and Shomorony (arXiv.2210.10917) show that such statistics (called k-mer density map) can be estimated within $\varepsilon $ accuracy from $ {\mathrm {poly}} (n, 2^{k}, 1/ {\varepsilon })$ traces. We call an algorithm to be k-mer-based if it reconstructs x given estimates of the k-mer density map. Such algorithms essentially capture all the analyses in the worst-case and smoothed-complexity models of the trace reconstruction problem we know of so far. Our first, and technically more involved, result shows that any k-mer-based algorithm for trace reconstruction must use $\exp (\Omega (n^{1/5} \sqrt {\log n}))$ traces, thus establishing the optimality of this number of traces. The analysis of this result also shows that the analysis technique used by Chase (STOC 2021) is essentially tight, and hence new techniques are needed in order to improve the worst-case upper bound. This result is shown by considering an appropriate class of real polynomials, that have been previously studied in the context of trace estimation (De, O’Donnell, Servedio. Annals of Probability 2019; Nazarov, Peres. STOC 2017), and proving that two of these polynomials are very close to each other on an arc in the complex plane. Our proof of the proximity of such polynomials uses new technical ingredients that allow us to focus on just a few coefficients of these polynomials. Our second, simple, result considers the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), which specifically picks the source string that has the maximum likelihood to generate the samples (traces). We show that the MLE algorithm uses a nearly optimal number of traces, i.e., up to a factor of n in the number of samples needed for an optimal algorithm, and show that this factor of n loss may be necessary under general “model estimation” settings.},

Finding the error locator polynomial is one of the key steps in the error correction procedure of RS codes. Modular Approach (MA) is an effective algorithm for solving the Welch-Berlekamp (WB) key-equation problem to find the error locator polynomial that needs $2t$ steps, where t is the error correction capability. In this paper, we first present a new MA algorithm that only requires $2e$ steps and then propose two fast decoding algorithms for RS codes based on our MA algorithm, where e is the number of errors and $e\leq t$ . We propose the Improved-Frequency Domain Modular Approach (I-FDMA) algorithm that needs $2e$ steps to solve the error locator polynomial and present our first decoding algorithm based on the I-FDMA algorithm. We show that, compared with the existing methods based on MA algorithms, our I-FDMA algorithm can effectively reduce the decoding complexity of RS codes when $e\lt t$ . Furthermore, we propose the $t_{0}$ -Shortened I-FDMA ( $t_{0}$ -SI-FDMA) algorithm ( $t_{0}$ is a predetermined even number less than $2t-1$ ) based on the new termination mechanism to solve the error number e quickly. We propose our second decoding algorithm based on the SI-FDMA algorithm for RS codes and show that the multiplication complexity of our second decoding algorithm is lower than our first decoding algorithm (the I-FDMA decoding algorithm) when $2e\lt t_{0}+1$ .},

  abstract     = {We introduce graphical error-correcting codes, a new notion of error-correcting codes on $[q]^{n}$ where a code is a set of proper q-colorings of some fixed n-vertex graph G. We then say that a set of M proper q-colorings of G form a $(G, M, d)$ code if any pair of colorings in the set have Hamming distance at least d. This directly generalizes typical $(n, M, d)$ codes of q-ary strings of length n since we can take G as the empty graph on n vertices. We investigate how one-sided spectral expansion relates to the largest possible set of error-correcting colorings on a graph. For fixed $(\delta, \lambda) \in [{0, 1}] \times [-1, 1]$ and positive integer d, let $f_{\delta, \lambda, d}(n)$ denote the maximum M such that there exists some d-regular graph G on at most n vertices with normalized second eigenvalue at most $\lambda $ that has a $(G, M, d)$ code. We study the growth of f as n goes to infinity. We partially characterize the regimes of $(\delta, \lambda)$ where f grows exponentially or is bounded by a constant, respectively. We also prove several sharp phase transitions between these regimes.},

  abstract     = {We generalize staircase codes and tiled diagonal zipper codes, preserving their key properties while allowing each coded symbol to be protected by arbitrarily many component codewords rather than only two. This generalization which we term “higher-order staircase codes” arises from the marriage of two distinct combinatorial objects: difference triangle sets and finite-geometric nets, which have typically been applied separately to code design. We demonstrate one possible realization of these codes, obtaining powerful, high-rate, low-error-floor, and low-complexity coding schemes based on simple iterative syndrome-domain decoding of coupled Hamming component codes. We anticipate that the proposed codes could improve performance–complexity–latency tradeoffs in high-throughput communications applications, most notably fiber-optic, in which classical staircase codes and zipper codes have been applied. We consider the construction of difference triangle sets having minimum scope and sum-of-lengths, which lead to memory-optimal realizations of higher-order staircase codes. These results also enable memory reductions for early families of convolutional codes constructed from difference triangle sets.},

This paper focuses on the cooperative model, and we provide explicit constructions of optimal MDS array codes with d helper nodes under this model. The sub-packetization level of our new codes is $(d-k+h)(d-k+1)^{\lceil n/2 \rceil }$ where h is the number of failed nodes, k the number of information nodes, and n the code length.

General properties of these code families are presented, including a characterization of their weight and distance distributions. Constructions of codes for each of the families are presented.

When the matrix X is input, the channel outputs $Y=A(X+W)$ where A is a uniformly chosen $n\times n$ invertible matrix over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ and where W is a uniformly chosen $n\times m$ matrix over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ of rank t. Silva et al. considered the case when $2n\leq m$ . They determined the asymptotic capacity of the AMMC when t, n and m are fixed and $q\rightarrow \infty $ . They also determined the leading term of the capacity when q is fixed, and t, n and m grow linearly. We generalise these results, showing that the condition $2n\geq m$ can be removed.

  abstract     = {Batched sparse (BATS) codes were proposed as a reliable communication solution for networks with packet loss. In the finite-length regime, the error probability of BATS codes under belief propagation (BP) decoding has been studied in the literature and can be analyzed by recursive formulae. However, all existing analyses have not considered precoding or have treated the BATS code and the precode as two separate entities. In this paper, we analyze the word-wise error probability of finite-length BATS codes with a precode under joint decoding, including BP decoding and maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. The joint BP decoder performs peeling decoding on a joint Tanner graph constructed from both the BATS and the precode Tanner graphs, and the joint ML decoder solves a single linear system with all linear constraints implied by the BATS code and the precode. We derive closed-form upper bounds on the error probability for both decoders. Specifically, low-density parity-check (LDPC) precodes are used for BP decoding, and any generic precode can be used for ML decoding. Even for BATS codes without a precode, the derived upper bound for BP decoding is more accurate than the approximate recursive formula, and easier to compute than the exact recursive formula. The accuracy of the two upper bounds has been verified by many simulation results. Based on the two upper bounds, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the degree distribution of LDPC-precoded BATS codes, which improves BP performance, ML performance, or both. In our experiments, to transmit 128 packets over a line network with packet loss, the optimized LDPC-precoded BATS codes reduce the transmission overhead to less than 50% of that of standard BATS codes under comparable decoding complexity constraints.},

  abstract     = {A simple, recently observed generalization of the classical Singleton bound to list-decoding asserts that rate R codes are not list-decodable using list-size L beyond an error fraction $\tfrac {L}{L+1} (1-R)$ (the Singleton bound being the case of $L=1$ , i.e., unique decoding). We prove that in order to approach this bound for any fixed $L \gt 1$ , one needs exponential alphabets. Specifically, for every $L\gt 1$ and $R\in (0,1)$ , if a rate R code can be list-of-L decoded up to error fraction $\tfrac {L}{L+1} (1-R -\varepsilon)$ , then its alphabet must have size at least $\exp (\Omega _{L,R}(1/\varepsilon))$ . This is in sharp contrast to the situation for unique decoding where certain families of rate R algebraic-geometry (AG) codes over an alphabet of size $O(1/\varepsilon ^{2})$ are unique-decodable up to error fraction $(1-R-\varepsilon)/2$ . Our bounds hold even for subconstant $\varepsilon \ge 1/n$ , implying that any code exactly achieving the L-th generalized Singleton bound requires alphabet size $2^{\Omega _{L,R}(n)}$ . Previously this was only known only for $L=2$ under the additional assumptions that the code is both linear and MDS. Our lower bound is tight up to constant factors in the exponent—with high probability random codes (or, as shown recently, even random linear codes) over $\exp (O_{L}(1/\varepsilon))$ -sized alphabets, can be list-of-L decoded up to error fraction $\tfrac {L}{L+1} (1-R -\varepsilon)$ .},

  abstract     = {In conventional DNA synthesis machines, usually many strands are synthesized in parallel by iterating through a supersequence $\boldsymbol {s}$ and adding in each cycle the next nucleotide to a programmable subset of the strands. The length of $\boldsymbol {s}$ determines the number of the cycles, hence the time and the cost of the synthesis process. Recently, in order to reduce the number of synthesis cycles, researchers have suggested to append in each cycle a shortmer, i.e., a sequence of nucleotides, instead of a single one. The present work studies this synthesis technique from a theoretical point of view. In particular, it discusses which shortmers are the best to use (in order to reduce the number of cycles), and how to calculate the number of cycles required to synthesize in parallel a set of strands using a given set of shormers. Lastly, and following a previously described connection between the DNA synthesis problem and costly constrained graphs, this paper investigates calculating the capacity of non-deterministic costly constrained graphs.},

In this paper, we investigate minimal pseudocodewords of binary Hamming codes described by full-rank parity-check matrices. We first provide some general results on minimal pseudocodewords with support size 3 of a binary parity-check matrix. We also prove a lower bound on the minimum binary symmetric channel (BSC) pseudoweight of a binary parity-check matrix. Then we prove that a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code has minimal pseudocodewords of certain types whose support sizes are larger than 3. Interestingly enough, the BSC pseudoweight of all these minimal pseudocodewords is 2. Using this fact as well as the above-mentioned lower bound, we further prove that a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code has minimum BSC pseudoweight 2. Moreover, the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC) pseudoweight of all these minimal pseudocodewords is 3. Based on numerical observations, we conjecture that a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code has minimum AWGNC pseudoweight 3. Finally, we provide more properties of a subset of minimal pseudocodewords of a full-rank parity-check matrix of a binary Hamming code.},

In this work, it is first shown that while the original social learning rule of Lalitha et al., 2018 achieves asymptotically vanishing error probabilities as the number of samples tends to infinity, it suffers a gap in the achievable error exponent compared to the centralized case. The gap is due to the network imbalance caused by the local weights that each node chooses to weigh the messages received from its neighbors. To close this gap, a modified learning rule is proposed and shown to achieve error exponents as large as those in the centralized setup. This implies that there is essentially no first-order penalty caused by decentralization in the exponentially decaying rate of error probabilities. To elucidate the price of decentralization, further analysis on the higher-order asymptotics of the error probability is conducted. It turns out that the price is at most a constant multiplicative factor in the error probability, equivalent to an $o(1/t)$ additive gap in the error exponent, where t is the number of samples observed by each agent in the network and the number of rounds of information exchange. This constant depends on the network connectivity and captures the level of network imbalance. Results of simulation on the error probability supporting our learning rule are shown. Further discussions and extensions of results are also presented.},

  abstract     = {The capacity of a state-dependent discrete memoryless channel is derived for the setting where a message-cognizant rate-limited helper observes the state sequence noncausally and provides its description to both encoder and decoder. Said capacity is not increased if the channel outputs are fed back to the encoder via a noiseless feedback link. The analogous capacity is derived for the Gaussian channel, where the state corresponds to the additive noise. In this setting the feedback link—while not increasing capacity—eliminates the need for the helper’s cognition of the transmitted message. Moreover, in this setting, the results on capacity also hold for the cutoff rate and the listsize capacity.},

  abstract     = {The proof of information inequalities and identities under linear constraints on the information measures is an important problem in information theory. For this purpose, ITIP and other variant algorithms have been developed and implemented, which are all based on solving a linear program (LP). Building on our recent work (Guo et al., 2023), we developed in this paper an enhanced approach for solving this problem. Experimental results show that our new approach improves the time complexity by over 500 times compared with Guo et al. (2023) for the problem studied by Tian (2014).},
