  abstract     = {Nowadays, automatic human activity recognition from video images is necessary for monitoring applications and caring for disabled people. The use of surveillance cameras and the processing of the obtained images leads to the achievement of a smart, accurate system for the recognition of human behavior. Since human detection in different scenes is associated with many challenges, several approaches have been implemented to detect human activity from video image processing. Due to the complexity of human activities, background noises and other factors affect the detection. For the solution of these problems, two deep learning-based algorithms have been described in the current article. According to the convolutional neural networks, the LSTM + CNN method and the 3D CNN method have been used to recognize the human activities in the images of the video. Each algorithm is explained and analyzed in detail. The experiments designed in this paper are performed by two datasets: the HMDB-51 dataset and the UCF101 dataset. In the HMDB-51 dataset, the highest obtained accuracy for CNN + LSTM method was equal to 70.2 and for method 3D CNN equal to 54.4. In the UCF101 dataset, the highest obtained accuracy for CNN + LSTM method was equal to 95.1 and for method 3D CNN equal to 90.8.},

The graph representation of a chemical compound that has atoms as vertices and chemical bonds as edges is called a molecular graph, and the Hosoya polynomial is a polynomial related to this graph. As a graph attribute that remains unchanged under graph isomorphism, the Hosoya polynomial is known as a graph invariant. It offers details regarding the quantity of distinct non-empty subgraphs within a specified graph. A topological metric called the Wiener index is employed to measure the branching complexity and size of a molecular graph. For every pair of vertices in a molecular network, the Wiener index is the total of those distances. In this paper, discussed the Hosoya polynomial, Wiener index and Hyper-Wiener index of the Abid-Waheed graphs (AW) a 8 and (AW) a 10 . This graph is similar to Jahangir’s graph.

One of the critical tasks in this domain is the automated detection of buildings within satellite imagery. Building detection holds substantial significance for urban planning, disaster management, environmental monitoring, and various other applications. The challenges in this field are manifold, including variations in building sizes, shapes, orientations, and surrounding environments. Furthermore, satellite imagery often contains occlusions, shadows, and other artifacts that can hinder accurate building detection. The proposed method introduces a novel approach to improve the boundary detection of detected buildings in high-resolution remote sensed images having shadows and irregular shapes. It aims to enhance the accuracy of building detection and classification. The proposed algorithm is compared with Customized Faster R-CNNs and Single-Shot Multibox Detectors to show the significance of the results. We have used different datasets for training and evaluating the algorithm. Experimental results show that SESLM for Building Detection in Satellite Imagery can detect 98.5% of false positives at a rate of 8.4%. In summary, SESLM showcases high accuracy and improved robustness in detecting buildings, particularly in the presence of shadows.},

With the goal of minimizing the sum of vehicle operating costs, delivery timeliness costs, goods loss costs, and carbon emissions costs, a multi-objective optimization model for community group purchase final delivery route planning is constructed. An improved genetic algorithm with a hill-climbing algorithm is utilized to enhance adaptive genetic operators, preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima and improving the solution efficiency. Finally, a case study simulation is conducted to validate the feasibility of the model and algorithm. Experimental results indicate that currently, among the three types of vehicles, fuel logistics vehicles still have an advantage in terms of vehicle usage cost. Electric logistics vehicles exhibit the poorest performance with the highest cost per hundred kilometers, but their sole advantage lies in their high energy release efficiency, enabling optimal low-carbon vehicle performance. Battery-swapping logistics vehicles perform the best in terms of carbon emissions, combining the advantages of both fuel-based and electric logistics vehicles. Therefore, battery-swapping logistics vehicles are a favorable choice for replacing fuel-based logistics vehicles in the future, offering promising prospects for future development.},

The proposed GBIFM method employs GBDT for data processing, which can flexibly handle various types of data without the need for one-hot encoding of discrete features. An Input-aware strategy is introduced to refine the weight vector and embedding vector of each feature for different instances, adaptively learning the impact of each input vector on feature representation. Furthermore, a fully connected network is incorporated to capture high-order features in a non-linear manner, enhancing the method’s ability to express and generalize complex structured data. A comprehensive experiment is conducted on the Criteo and Avazu datasets, the results show that compared to typical methods such as DeepFM, AFM, and IFM, the proposed method GBIFM can increase the AUC value by 10% –12% and decrease the Logloss value by 6% –20%, effectively improving the accuracy of click-through rate prediction.},

In this article, modified AlexNet deep leaning model is proposed to category the source retinal images into either healthy or Glaucoma through the detection and segmentations of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) regions in retinal pictures. The retinal images are preprocessed and OD region is detected and segmented using circulatory filter. Further, OC regions are detected and segmented using K-means classification algorithm. Then, the segmented OD and OC region are classified and trained by the suggested AlexNet deep leaning model. This model classifies the source retinal image into either healthy or Glaucoma. Finally, performance measures have been estimated in relation to ground truth pictures in regards to accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. These performance measures are contrasted with the other previous Glaucoma detection techniques on publicly accessible retinal image datasets HRF and RIGA. The suggested technique as described in this work achieves 91.6% GDR for mild case and also achieves 100% GDR for severe case on HRF dataset.

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to reduce reliance on labeled data. Achieving high performance often requires more complex algorithms, therefore, generic SSL algorithms are less effective when it comes to image classification tasks. In this study, we propose ComMatch, a simpler and more effective algorithm that combines negative learning, dynamic thresholding, and predictive stability discriminations into the consistency regularization approach. The introduction of negative learning is to help facilitate training by selecting negative pseudo-labels during stages when the network has low confidence. And ComMatch filters positive and negative pseudo-labels more accurately as training progresses by dynamic thresholds. Since high confidence does not always mean high accuracy due to network calibration issues, we also introduce network predictive stability, which filters out samples by comparing the standard deviation of the network output with a set threshold, thus largely reducing the influence of noise in the training process. ComMatch significantly outperforms existing algorithms over several datasets, especially when there is less labeled data available. For example, ComMatch achieves 1.82% and 3.6% error rate reduction over FlexMatch and FixMatch on CIFAR-10 with 40 labels respectively. And with 4000 labeled samples, ComMatch achieves 0.54% and 2.65% lower error rates than FixMatch and MixMatch, respectively.},

IoT devices are getting more common in our daily lives, with diverse applications ranging from consumer sector to industrial and commercial systems. The rapid expansion and widespread use of IoT devices highlight the critical significance of solid and effective cybersecurity standards across the device development life cycle. Therefore, if vulnerability is exploited directly affects the IoT device and the applications. In this paper we investigated and assessed the various real-world critical IoT attacks/vulnerabilities that have affected IoT deployed in the commercial, industrial and consumer sectors since 2010. Subsequently, we evoke the vulnerabilities or type of attack, exploitation techniques, compromised security factors, intensity of vulnerability and impacts of the expounded real-world attacks/vulnerabilities. We first categorise how each attack affects information security parameters, and then we provide a taxonomy based on the security factors that are affected. Next, we perform a risk assessment of the security parameters that are encountered, using two well-known multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques namely Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) and Fuzzy-Analytic Network Process (F-ANP) to determine the severity of severely impacted information security measures.},
