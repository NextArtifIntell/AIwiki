  abstract     = {Reconstructing complex networks from observed, often noisy data is a fundamental task crucial for understanding complex systems across various domains. Despite numerous methods proposed for network reconstruction, little attention has been given to the relationship between reconstructability and the intrinsic properties of hidden networks. Here, we present a mathematical proof that, for scale-free networks, the reconstruction accuracy increases as the exponent of the power-law degree distribution decreases. This suggests that degree heterogeneity contributes to higher reconstructability. We validate this conclusion in empirical networks, where nodal degrees may not strictly adhere to power laws. Our results demonstrate that the reconstruction accuracy of degree-heterogeneous networks is indeed significantly higher than that of their randomized counterparts.},

Furthermore, in agreement with previous experimental observations, we predict room temperature magnetism in A 4 B 3 O 9 oxides that indicates the promising practical applications of these compounds in the next generation memory devices.},

Using combined dynamic and inelastic light scattering techniques, we simultaneously measure the shear and bulk viscosities of water as a function of pressure. The former increases faster than the latter, so that their ratio shows a twofold decrease from 0 to 1.6 GPa; we confirm this trend with simulations. We analyze our results in terms of the structural relaxation time . Contrary to other liquids, pressure initially accelerates relaxation in water. Our measurements reveal that reaches a minimum close to 1 ps around 0.5 GPa. We interpret as the equilibration time of hydrogen bonds and propose that the minimum in arises from a structural anomaly that allows fastest interconversion between local structures in water and generates a cascade of thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies.},

The average numbers of visible blips are measured to be 0.74 ± 0.19 and 1.86 ± 0.17 near muon and pion track endpoints, respectively. The 3.6 σ statistically significant difference in blip content between muons and pions provides the first demonstration of a new method of pion-muon discrimination in neutrino liquid argon time projection chamber experiments. LArIAT Monte Carlo simulations predict substantially higher average blip counts for negative muon ( 1.22 ± 0.08 ) and pion ( 2.34 ± 0.09 ) nuclear captures.

  abstract     = {We use nonlinear pump-probe spectroscopy to study optical excitations in a charge-tunable moiré heterostructure. An intense red-detuned laser pulse creates a photonic dressing of the material by introducing a large virtual population of excitons or exciton polarons in a deep moiré potential. By measuring the resulting ac Stark effect with a weak resonant laser pulse, we gain access to the nature and mutual interactions of the elementary optical excitations. At charge neutrality, our measurements reveal that different exciton resonances, associated with confinement of their center-of-mass motion in the moiré potential, have a significant spatial overlap. The resulting short-range interactions manifest themselves as a density-dependent blueshift for same-valley excitons and bound biexciton states for opposite-valley excitons. The attractive polaron resonance that appears upon injection of electrons into the heterostructure shows a contrasting behavior: Here, we observe an electron-density-independent light shift and a clear pump-power-dependent saturation. These features are equivalent to that of an ensemble of independent two-level emitters and indicate a breakdown of the Fermi-polaron picture for optical excitations of electrons subject to a strong moiré potential. Our work establishes an experimental approach to elucidate the elementary optical excitations of semiconductor moiré heterostructures, providing a solid ground for the spectroscopy of correlated electronic and excitonic states in such materials.},

Here, we report definitive photoemission evidence of electron-spin fluctuation coupling in the iron-based superconductor CaKFe 4 As 4 , obtained via high-resolution ARPES. Our study identifies a distinct kink structure on the α band, observable only in the superconducting phase and closely linked with the superconductivity, indicative of strong electron-boson interactions. Notably, this kink structure corresponds to two distinct bosonic modes at 11 meV and 13 meV, aligning with spin resonance modes previously observed in inelastic neutron-scattering experiments. This alignment underscores the significant role of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the pairing mechanism of this superconductor. Furthermore, the unique momentum-dependent and orbital-selective properties of the coupling revealed by ARPES provide profound insights into the pairing symmetry, suggesting predominantly s ± -wave pairing facilitated by spin fluctuations. Our findings not only highlight the pivotal role of spin resonance in the superconductivity of CaKFe 4 As 4 but also enhance our understanding of the electron-spin fluctuation interactions in unconventional superconductors.},

  abstract = {Self-alignment describes the property of a polar active unit to align or antialign its orientation toward its velocity. In contrast to mutual alignment, where the headings of multiple active units tend to directly align with each other—as in the Vicsek model—self-alignment impacts the dynamics at the individual level by coupling the rotation and displacements of each active unit. This enriches the dynamics even in the absence of interactions and allows, for example, a single self-propelled particle to orbit in a harmonic potential. At the collective level, self-alignment modifies the nature of the transition to collective motion already in the mean-field description and can lead to other forms of self-organization such as collective actuation in dense or solid elastic assemblies of active units. This has significant implications for the study of dense biological systems, metamaterials, and swarm robotics. Here a number of models are reviewed that were introduced independently to describe the previously overlooked property of self-alignment and some of its experimental realizations are identified. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) to underline the importance of self-alignment in active systems, especially in the context of dense populations of active units and active solids; (ii) to provide a unified mathematical and conceptual framework for the description of self-aligning systems; and (iii) to discuss the common features and specific differences of the existing models of self-alignment. The review concludes by discussing promising research avenues in which the concept of self-alignment could play a significant role.},

  abstract = {Quantum theory and general relativity are about one century old. At present, they are considered the best available explanations of physical reality, and they have been corroborated so far by all realized experiments. Nonetheless, the quest to unify them is still ongoing, with several yet untested proposals for a theory of quantum gravity. Here the nascent field of information-theoretic methods applied to designing tests of quantum gravity in the laboratory is reviewed. This field emerges from the extension of quantum-information-theory methodologies beyond the domain of applicability of quantum theory itself to cover gravity. The focus is mainly on the detection of gravitational entanglement between two quantum probes, with this method compared to single-probe schemes. The experimental proposal that originated this field is reviewed, as are its variants and their applications. Their potential implications for the quantum theory of gravity are discussed. The role of general information-theoretic principles in illuminating the search for quantum effects in gravity is also highlighted.},

  abstract = {Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) microscopy resolves optical absorption in cells and tissues, thus offering a complementary contrast mechanism to optical microscopy. Yet, the marked advances in optical microscopy techniques and their widespread use beg the question of the particular need and utility of an additional microscopy modality that resolves optical absorption. Recent advances that point to advantageous features and uses of optoacoustic microscopy in biological and clinical interrogation are presented. How these advances can be manifested as part of hybrid implementations using optical, optoacoustic, and possibly other forms of microscopy to enhance the ability of the microscopic interrogation is reviewed. Further examined are developments in the miniaturized optical detection of ultrasound, which can transform any optical microscope into a hybrid optical-optoacoustic system. In addition, recent progress with label-free molecular sensing and with new classes of novel reporters that expand the visualization capacity of the optoacoustic method are presented. Finally, how hybrid optical-optoacoustic microscopy offers a next step in multimodal interrogations, thereby impacting biological and clinical readings, is discussed.},

  abstract = {Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular, electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This Colloquium takes this perspective: concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in nonstandard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices and quasicrystals, as well as higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing an introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. Light is shone on the novel phenomena that arise from these geometries: condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases that are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search for quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.},
