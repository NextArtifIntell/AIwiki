  abstract = {Self-alignment describes the property of a polar active unit to align or antialign its orientation toward its velocity. In contrast to mutual alignment, where the headings of multiple active units tend to directly align with each other—as in the Vicsek model—self-alignment impacts the dynamics at the individual level by coupling the rotation and displacements of each active unit. This enriches the dynamics even in the absence of interactions and allows, for example, a single self-propelled particle to orbit in a harmonic potential. At the collective level, self-alignment modifies the nature of the transition to collective motion already in the mean-field description and can lead to other forms of self-organization such as collective actuation in dense or solid elastic assemblies of active units. This has significant implications for the study of dense biological systems, metamaterials, and swarm robotics. Here a number of models are reviewed that were introduced independently to describe the previously overlooked property of self-alignment and some of its experimental realizations are identified. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) to underline the importance of self-alignment in active systems, especially in the context of dense populations of active units and active solids; (ii) to provide a unified mathematical and conceptual framework for the description of self-aligning systems; and (iii) to discuss the common features and specific differences of the existing models of self-alignment. The review concludes by discussing promising research avenues in which the concept of self-alignment could play a significant role.},

  abstract = {Quantum theory and general relativity are about one century old. At present, they are considered the best available explanations of physical reality, and they have been corroborated so far by all realized experiments. Nonetheless, the quest to unify them is still ongoing, with several yet untested proposals for a theory of quantum gravity. Here the nascent field of information-theoretic methods applied to designing tests of quantum gravity in the laboratory is reviewed. This field emerges from the extension of quantum-information-theory methodologies beyond the domain of applicability of quantum theory itself to cover gravity. The focus is mainly on the detection of gravitational entanglement between two quantum probes, with this method compared to single-probe schemes. The experimental proposal that originated this field is reviewed, as are its variants and their applications. Their potential implications for the quantum theory of gravity are discussed. The role of general information-theoretic principles in illuminating the search for quantum effects in gravity is also highlighted.},

  abstract = {Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) microscopy resolves optical absorption in cells and tissues, thus offering a complementary contrast mechanism to optical microscopy. Yet, the marked advances in optical microscopy techniques and their widespread use beg the question of the particular need and utility of an additional microscopy modality that resolves optical absorption. Recent advances that point to advantageous features and uses of optoacoustic microscopy in biological and clinical interrogation are presented. How these advances can be manifested as part of hybrid implementations using optical, optoacoustic, and possibly other forms of microscopy to enhance the ability of the microscopic interrogation is reviewed. Further examined are developments in the miniaturized optical detection of ultrasound, which can transform any optical microscope into a hybrid optical-optoacoustic system. In addition, recent progress with label-free molecular sensing and with new classes of novel reporters that expand the visualization capacity of the optoacoustic method are presented. Finally, how hybrid optical-optoacoustic microscopy offers a next step in multimodal interrogations, thereby impacting biological and clinical readings, is discussed.},

  abstract = {Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular, electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This Colloquium takes this perspective: concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in nonstandard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices and quasicrystals, as well as higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing an introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. Light is shone on the novel phenomena that arise from these geometries: condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases that are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search for quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.},
